{"id":56813,"title":"Efficacy and safety of a new surgical method to treat malignant glaucoma in pseudophakia.","abstract":"To assess the efficacy and safety of a relatively new surgical method in pseudophakic malignant glaucoma patients.This study is a retrospective, non-comparative, interventional case series. Ten eyes of nine pseudophakic malignant glaucoma patients with mean age of 63.3 years were analysed. All 10 eyes underwent a novel surgical technique, an anterior chamber capsulo-hyaloidectomy and anterior vitrectomy through the peripheral iridectomy. Main outcome measures were: reformation of the anterior chamber, intraocular pressure (IOP), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and complications.All 10 eyes with pseudophakic malignant glaucoma were treated successfully by using a new surgical technique. All cases had a relief of aqueous misdirection with anterior chamber deepening during and after the surgery and post-operative intraocular pressure (IOP) normalization. No relapses have been observed so far. There were no complications during surgery and in the post-operative period.The presented surgical technique seems to be safe and effective in all cases of malignant glaucoma in pseudophakia.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625375","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.788616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.706541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.521857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Iridectomy","weight":0.399667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridectomy"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.160494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.108802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Protestant Reformation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
