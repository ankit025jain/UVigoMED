{"id":84706,"title":"Prurigo simplex subacuta or prurigo simplex acuta?","abstract":"Prurigo is a condition of nodular cutaneous lesions that itch intensely. Prurigo lesions are divided into acute, subacute and chronic forms that itch intensely. Subacute prurigo (SP) clinically presents as excoriated papules mostly in a symmetrical distribution on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, neck, lower trunk, and buttocks. It tends to occur in middle-aged patients, especially in women. Herein, we described prurigo simplex subacuta in a 4-year-old boy. It was histopathologically documented.
