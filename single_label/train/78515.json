{"id":78515,"title":"Concurrent use of cisplatin or cetuximab with definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.","abstract":"The goal of the present work was to compare outcomes of definitive concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with cetuximab-based bioradiotherapy (BRT) in locally advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Between 2006 and 2012, 265 patients with locally advanced HNSCC were treated at our institution with CRT (n = 194; 73%) with three cycles of cisplatin (100 mg/m(2), every 3 weeks) or BRT (n = 71; 27%) with weekly cetuximab. Patients receiving BRT had more pre-existing conditions (Charlson index ? 2) than the CRT group (p = 0.005).Median follow-up was 29 months. In all, 56% of patients treated with CRT received the planned three cycles (92% at least two cycles) and 79% patients treated with BRT received six cycles or more. The 2-year actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 72% and 61%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis (MVA), T4 stage, N2-3 stage, smoking status (current smoker as compared with never smoker), and non-oropharyngeal locations predicted for OS, whereas BRT association with OS was of borderline significance (p = 0.054). The 2-year actuarial locoregional control (LRC) and distant control (DC) rates were 73 and 79%, respectively. CRT was independently associated with an improved LRC (2-year LRC: 76% for CRT vs. 61% for BRT) and DC (2-year LRC: 81% for CRT vs. 68% for BRT) in comparison with BRT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01 in the MVA). Subgroup analyses showed that T4 patients benefited significantly from CRT (vs. BRT) in LRC, while T1-3 did not. BRT patients had more G3-4 skin complications (p < 0.001) and CRT patients had higher rates of feeding tube placement (p = 0.006) and G3-4 gastrointestinal toxicities (p < 0.001).This retrospective analysis showed a better LRC in locally advanced HNSCC treated by cisplatin-based CRT than cetuximab-based BRT, and a nonsignificant trend towards an improved OS.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
