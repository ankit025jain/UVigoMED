{"id":37778,"title":"Biliary atresia - aÂ new derivative method?","abstract":"Biliary atresia is a progressive cholangiopathy in neonates of unknown origin. Surgical intervention - Kasai portoenterostomy - is the only treatment possible. However, only liver transplantation can be considered a definitive solution even in cases of favourable post-operative course, i.e., after bile passage has been recreated.The authors set out to identify ways to optimize the operative treatment in biliary atresia patients. In particular, their objective was to identify a suitable bile derivation area outside porta hepatis, thereby simplifying the surgical procedure of the following liver transplantation.The research was conducted from 2006 to 2010 on a set of 30 corrosive casts prepared by the Institute of Anatomy, Medical Faculty, Comenius University Bratislava. The research consisted of an analysis of individual tubular structures of the liver parenchyma, particularly the bile vessels. The authors explored the latter's position and branching out, as well as their relationships in different segments, and their availability in surgical exploration.The analysis of the corrosive casts resulted in selecting an area in liver segments II and III suitable for creating a new type of hepatoenterostomy. The area is sufficiently distant from porta hepatis, conveniently accessible to the surgeon, and has a broad bile duct branch. This type of anastomosis would preserve the anatomic situation in the porta hepatis area intact for the following transplantation.While the results of the experiment warrant some optimism, authors will have to wait until this type of derivation operation is applicable in practice. The authors continue their research by performing anastomosis in an animal model (Fig. 5, Ref. 18)","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
