{"id":73735,"title":"Primary osseous hemangiopericytoma in the thoracic spine.","abstract":"Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is a rare tumor of the central nervous system, most commonly found in the cranial cavity. HPCs in the spine are rare, and very few of them are primary osseous HPC. The aims of this study were to describe a rare case of primary osseous HPC in the thoracic spine and review the literature. A 54-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of back pain. Aneuro logical examination revealed no motor or sensory deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumor originating from the bone structure of the T10 vertebra with paravertebral extension, and chest CT revealed pulmonary metastases. A laminectomy, face-totomy,and subtotal resection of the tumor was performed with posterior pedicle screw system fixation followed by radiotherapy. The post-operative course was uneventful. His back pain was resolved completely after surgery. The patient survived with tumor during the 18-month follow-up period. Histopathology and immunohistologic findings were consistent with HPC. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor was positive for vimentin and CD34, partially positive for S-100, but negative for EMA, desmin, CD117, and CD1a. A literature review identified eight such cases reported between 1942 and 2013. As a conclusion, clinical manifestations of primary osseous spinal HPCs are different from intraspinal meningeal HPCs. Although showing certain variability, histopathology and immunohistochemical examinations are essential to establish the diagnosis. Surgical resection and radiotherapy are the treatment of choice. *These authors contributed equally to this
