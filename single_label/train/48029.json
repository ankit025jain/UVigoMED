{"id":48029,"title":"[Medical and environmental aspects of the drinking water supply crisis].","abstract":"Modern data determining drinking water supply crisis in Russia have been considered. The probability of influence of drinking water quality used by population on current negative demographic indices was shown. The necessity of taking into account interests of public health care in the process of formation of water management decisions was grounded. To achieve this goal the application of medical ecological interdisciplinary approach was proposed Its use is mostly effective in construction of goal-directed medical ecological sections for territorial schemes of the rational use and protection of water resources. Stages of the elaboration of these sections, providing the basing of evaluation and prognostic medical and environmental constructions on similar engineering studies of related disciplinary areas (hydrological, hydrogeological, hydrobiological, hydrochemical, environmental, socio-economic, technical and technological) were determined.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Disorders of Environmental Origin","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624819","annotations":[{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.817761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.738002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Hydrology","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.71709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.668312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Water resources","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.611404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.598602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.581644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Hydrogeology","weight":0.576192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogeology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Water management","weight":0.456969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_management"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.382993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.358068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Water quality","weight":0.298129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0416485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Russian Revolution (1917)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_(1917)"},{"name":"Green building","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_building"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"List of countries by population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
