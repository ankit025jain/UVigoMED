{"id":79141,"title":"The role of immediate postoperative systemic corticosteroids when utilizing a steroid-eluting spacer following sinus surgery.","abstract":"Steroid-eluting spacers can improve local drug delivery immediately following endoscopic sinus surgery and reduce the recurrence of inflammation warranting systemic corticosteroids. For chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, the need for systemic corticosteroids immediately following endoscopic sinus surgery when using a steroid-eluting spacer has not been studied.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Academic rhinology practice.Both arms received significant improvement in endoscopic grading and disease-specific quality of life from baseline compared to 2-month follow-up (P < .001). There were no significant differences in mean endoscopic scores between the postoperative prednisone and control groups at 1 week (P = .715), 3 weeks (P = .883), or 2 months (P = .343). There were no significant differences in SNOT-22 scores between groups at all follow-up points (all P > .119).Minimizing systemic corticosteroid use in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis may avoid adverse events. Results from this study suggest that postoperative systemic corticosteroids immediately following endoscopic sinus surgery may not provide improved outcomes when utilizing a steroid-eluting spacer.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482348","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.838864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.636262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.555046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.390163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.249642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.221947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.0373501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Rhinology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinology"},{"name":"883","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/883"},{"name":"Warrant (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Minimisation (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimisation_(psychology)"}]}
