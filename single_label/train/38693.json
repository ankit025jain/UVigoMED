{"id":38693,"title":"Telemedicine for genetic and neurologic evaluation in the neonatal intensive care unit.","abstract":"Evaluate whether telemedicine can be used to perform dysmorphology and neurologic examinations in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by determining the examination accuracy, limitations and optimized procedures.Prospective evaluation of NICU patients referred for subspecialty consultation for dysmorphic features (n=10) or encephalopathy (n=10). A physician at bedside (bedside clinician) performed an in-person examination that was viewed in real time by a remote physician (remote consultant). Standardized examinations were recorded and compared. Subsequently, a qualitative approach established technique adjustments and optimization procedures necessary to improve visualization.Telemedicine examinations identified 81 of 87 (93%) dysmorphology examination abnormalities and 37 of 39 (92%) neurologic examination abnormalities. Optimization of remote consultant visualization required an active bedside clinician assisting in camera and patient adjustments.Telemedicine can be used to perform accurately many components of the dysmorphology or neurologic examinations in NICU patients, but physicians must be mindful of specific limitations.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406740","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Telemedicine","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemedicine"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.616326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.5278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.505647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.471877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Teratology","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.236288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.155323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"In camera","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_camera"},{"name":"Neurological examination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_examination"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mindfulness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Dysmorphic feature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmorphic_feature"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Visualization (computer graphics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
