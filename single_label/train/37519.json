{"id":37519,"title":"Giant remnant of fetal circulation leading to cyanosis: pseudo-cor triatriatum dexter.","abstract":"Remnants of the right valve of the sinus venosus, which fail to regress may present as an obstructing membrane within the right atrium as a very rare congenital anomaly. When associated with an atrial septal defect, primary cyanosis may occur due to a large right-to-left shunt. We report on a 1-week old girl with a pseudo-cor triatriatum dexter and immediate cyanosis after an uncomplicated birth. She was successfully treated with surgical excision of the obstructing membrane.
