{"id":46378,"title":"Meta-analysis of two types of digestive tract reconstruction modes after total gastrectomy.","abstract":"This study aims to evaluate the application value of two reconstruction technique types, namely, Roux-en-Y reconstruction with pouch (RYP) and jejunal interposition with pouch (JIP), after total gastrectomy.MEDLINE, EM-BASE, PubMed, CBM, and Vol. 2, 2010 of the Cochrane Library were indexed using computers, whereas relevant Chinese journals were manually indexed. After including total gastrectomy, random RYP and JIP control tests and evaluations on their methodological quality were conducted. Revman 5.1 software was utilised for the statistical analysis.Three random control tests that included patients of 166 cases were performed. Meta-analysis results indicated that RYP involved a shorter operation time than JIP (WMD = -17.27, 95% CI = -29.58 to -4.96). For postoperative complications (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.33 to 1.59), no substantial differences were found in bile reflux (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.94), postoperative nutritional status, and weight.The application value of RYP and JIP clinical results need further random control research to fully evaluate their efficacies.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634950","annotations":[{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.810405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"China","weight":0.140815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Weapon of mass destruction","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0245813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Citation index","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_index"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Comparison of American and Canadian football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_Canadian_football"},{"name":"Interposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interposition"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Certified Broadcast Meteorologist","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Broadcast_Meteorologist"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"}]}
