{"id":68450,"title":"Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury increases risk of long-term malignancy: a population-based study.","abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is gaining worldwide attention recently, emerging as a major public health threat. However, the association between the development of AKI and subsequent malignancy has not been studied before.We conducted a population study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance database, using 1,000,000 representative database during 2000-2008. All patients' survival to discharge from index hospitalization with recovery from dialysis-requiring AKI were identified (recovery group), and matched with those without recovery and those without AKI, at a 1:1:1 ratio.We identified 625 individuals more than 18 years old [352 male (56.5%); mean age, 63.3 years] in recovery group and matched 625 individuals in each group. During a mean followed-up of 3.7 years, the incidences of new-onset malignancy were 4.2, 2.9, and 2.6 per 100 person-year among the non-recovery, the recovery, and the non-AKI group, respectively. After adjustment, the recovery group was more likely to develop long-term de novo malignancy than those without AKI [hazard ratio (HR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.03; p = 0.04], while less likely than those who did not recover (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.98; p = 0.04).Dialysis-requiring AKI can post a long-term risk of de novo malignancy for those who survive from the initial insult. Even patients who have recovered from dialysis still carry a significantly higher possibility of developing malignancy than those without AKI episode.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519490","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.710666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.464248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.44248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0214189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Insult","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Octane rating","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Population biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_biology"},{"name":"Health threat from cosmic rays","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_threat_from_cosmic_rays"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"}]}
