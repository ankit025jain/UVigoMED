{"id":84260,"title":"[Deleterious effects of smoking on the musculoskeletal system].","abstract":"Tobacco smoking has important negative effects on the musculoskeletal system: decrease of bone mineral density, increase of the risk of injury, illness, and perioperative complications such as fracture-healing complications and wound complications. Orthopaedic surgeons should inform all patients of the increased risks associated with active smoking in the perioperative period and should encourage them to quit smoking four to eight weeks in advance of the proposed procedure.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141568","annotations":[{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.458966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.328827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.230438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
