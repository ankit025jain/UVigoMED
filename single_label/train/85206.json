{"id":85206,"title":"[Assessing and forecasting morbidity of adolescents living in area influenced by aluminium production].","abstract":"Objective of the study--to forecast morbidity (of respiratory diseases) among adolescents via mathematic modelling during primary exploitation of new aluminium production (exemplified by Taishet city). Incidence during 2003-2011 of all diseases in the adolescents equalled 1129,1 per thousand, of respiratory diseases--627,4 per thousand. The mathematic model was designed to reveal role of environmental hazards in morbidity formation. According to medium-term forecast results, launching the aluminium production plant in East Siberia in 3 years will increase by 67% the morbidity with respiratory diseases in the adolescents.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051674","annotations":[{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.43922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.390213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.352127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.264907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.199866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.135444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Siberia","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia"},{"name":"Weather forecasting","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting"},{"name":"Exploitation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Tayshet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayshet"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"East","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East"},{"name":"List of environmental health hazards","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_environmental_health_hazards"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"}]}
