{"id":83432,"title":"[Application of acellular allograft dermal matrix in breast implants for secondary breast deformity post polyacrylamide hydrogel removal].","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and efficiency of acellular dermal matrix combined with implant in correcting the secondary deformity post polyacrylamide hydrogel removal.A retrospective study enrolling 23 female patients (42 breasts) who received breast deformity correction from June 2008 to June 2012 with acellular dermal matrix and implant were performed.One patient suffered bilateral seroma and 1 patient suffered infection in one side. None of the implants were removed. Patients were followed up for (15.0Â±11.7) months (range: 3-36 months), and the results were satisfactory.Acelluar dermal matrix and implant can be safely used simultaneously in correcting the secondary breast deformity post polyacrylamide hydrogel removal.","date":"2014-11-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25360653","annotations":[{"name":"Seroma","weight":0.922687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.459367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.383118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0424438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Polyacrylamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Non-cellular life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life"}]}
