{"id":65524,"title":"Fetal and infant growth patterns and kidney function at school age.","abstract":"Low birth weight is associated with ESRD. To identify specific growth patterns in early life that may be related to kidney function in later life, we examined the associations of longitudinally measured fetal and infant growth with kidney function in school-aged children. This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study among 6482 children followed from fetal life onward. Fetal and childhood growth was measured during second and third trimesters of pregnancy, at birth, and at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months postnatally. At the age of 6 years, we measured kidney volume by ultrasound. GFR was estimated using blood creatinine levels. Higher gestational age-adjusted birth weight was associated with higher combined kidney volume and higher eGFR (per 1 SD score increase in birth weight; 1.27 cm(3) [95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.93] and 0.78 ml/min per 1.73 m2 [95% CI, 0.16 to 1.39], respectively). Fetal weight, birth weight, and weight at 6 months were positively associated with childhood kidney volume, whereas higher second trimester fetal weight was positively associated with higher GFR (all P values<0.05). Fetal and childhood lengths were not consistently associated with kidney function. In this cohort, lower fetal and early infant weight growth is associated with smaller kidney volume in childhood, whereas only lower fetal weight growth is associated with lower kidney function in childhood, independent of childhood growth. Whether these associations lead to an increased risk of kidney disease needs to be studied further.","date":"2014-11-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812164","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.837442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.694029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.372855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
