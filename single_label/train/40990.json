{"id":40990,"title":"Measuring the symptoms of pediatric constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: expert commentary and literature review.","abstract":"Symptom measurement in pediatric chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) trials requires appropriately developed clinical outcome assessments (COAs).Literature was reviewed to identify symptom COAs meeting regulatory standards. Searches were conducted in Pubmed/Medline, EMBASE, and PsychINFO. Title/abstracts were reviewed to identify qualitative studies and those using COAs to measure pediatric CIC/IBS symptoms. Pediatric functional gastrointestinal experts provided input on relevant symptom-concepts to measure.Review of 1,105 abstracts identified 1 relevant qualitative article and 113 articles including COAs. Symptoms most frequently measured in CIC studies were frequency of bowel movements, fecal incontinence/encopresis, abdominal pain, stool consistency, and painful defecation. Symptoms most frequently measured in IBS were abdominal pain, abdominal distention/bloating, stool consistency, frequency of bowel movements, and gas. Evidence of development/validity of COAs was limited. Expert feedback was broadly consistent with the literature.Findings demonstrate consistency in the literature on key CIC/IBS symptoms to measure in pediatric trials, but existing COAs do not meet regulatory standards.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965712","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.76892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"PsycINFO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PsycINFO"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Sports commentator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"}]}
