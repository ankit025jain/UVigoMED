{"id":21827,"title":"Performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold and tuberculin skin test relative to subjects' risk of exposure to tuberculosis.","abstract":"Performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and tuberculin skin test (TST) has not been compared in a US college population with varying risk of tuberculosis exposure.We performed a retrospective chart review of students tested for tuberculosis at the University of Pennsylvania Student Health Service between 2009 and 2011. We stratified students into high-, low-, and no-risk categories for exposure to tuberculosis and compared QFT-GIT and TST performance in risk groups adjusting demographic characteristics.During the study period, 15 936 tuberculosis tests were performed in 9483 college students. Coming from a tuberculosis-endemic country was the only risk factor significantly associated with having a positive result (odds ratio [OR] 12.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.2-16.5). Test specificity was higher for TST than QFT-GIT (99.7% vs 91.4%; P < .0001). Application of a higher threshold for positivity improved comparability of QFT-GIT with TST in the low-risk group (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.2; 95% CI, .4-3.3) but not in the high-risk group (AOR .4; 95% CI, .3-.5).QFT-GIT was less specific than TST. Our findings support the use of TST for US college students who need tuberculosis testing and the use of risk-stratified interpretation for students who are tested with QFT-GIT.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585559","annotations":[{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","weight":0.592152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.547152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.41043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.356126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.141119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Album-oriented rock","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Comparability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
