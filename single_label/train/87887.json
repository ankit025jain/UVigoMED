{"id":87887,"title":"\"Push-past\" reaming as a reduction aid with intramedullary nailing of metadiaphyseal and diaphyseal femoral shaft fractures.","abstract":"Eccentric reaming of cortical bone near a fracture site can introduce malalignment when an intramedullary nail is placed. The authors describe a technique of reaming metadiaphyseal and diaphyseal femur fractures in which maintaining reduction at the fracture site is not necessary to obtain an excellent alignment of long bone fractures after intramedullary nailing. They have found that central reaming proximal and distal to, but not at, the fracture site allows for excellent reduction of long bone fractures when the intramedullary nail is passed. The reamer is stopped just before the fracture site and then \"pushed\" across the fracture prior to resumption of reaming. The authors present \"push-past\" reaming as a technical trick to facilitate reduction of femoral fractures treated with intramedullary nails and a consecutive series of 18 cases in which excellent postoperative alignment was achieved.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972428","annotations":[{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.872516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.727985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.545297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cortex (anatomy)","weight":0.146605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortex_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Reamer","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamer"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"}]}
