{"id":79165,"title":"[Expression and significance of osteopontin and muscle segment homeobox gene Msx2 in sinonasal inverted papilloma].","abstract":"To investigate the expression level and significance of osteopontin (OPN) and muscle segment homeobox2 (Msx2) in sinonasal inverted papilloma (SNIP), and the relationship with the process of SNIP malignant transfomation.Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of osteopontin and Msx2 in 32 cases of sinonasal inverted papilloma (SNIP), 30 cases of inflammatory nasal polyp paraffin tissue (INP) and 30 cases of sinonasal inverted papilloma with carcinoma. According to the pathology results SNIP were divided into mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia. All the datas were analyzed by SPSS13.0.The positive expression of OPN and Msx2 in the SNIP with carcinoma were all 100% (30/30), were significantly higher than the SNIP and INP, and the pairwise comparisons were all statistically significant (P < 0.05). The expression of OPN and Msx2 in the SNIP were divided according to pathological. There was significant difference between mild dysplasia and severe dysplasia group (P < 0.05), while there were not significant difference between light degree of dysplasia and moderate dysplasia group, moderate dysplasia and severe dysplasia group. And the expression of OPN and Msx2 was positively correlated in SNIP (P < 0.01).OPN and Msx2 may play an important role in the pathway of progression of SNIP, which may be identified as the new therapeutic targets.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479353","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.732907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.541668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.540434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.384902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Osteopontin","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopontin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.201029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Homeobox","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"31st century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_century"},{"name":"Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budker_Institute_of_Nuclear_Physics"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Pairwise comparison","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_comparison"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"}]}
