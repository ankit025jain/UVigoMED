{"id":1248,"title":"Cardiovascular disease mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.","abstract":"Is there a full-blown stroke epidemic and a growing ischemic heart disease (IHD) epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa? We aim to further understand the evolution of stroke and IHD in Sub-Saharan Africa with an analysis of the most recent Global Burden of Disease estimates of mortality for men of Sub-Saharan African descent in Africa and in the Caribbean and a review of recent studies found on PubMed and reference lists of published articles. Stroke is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease mortality in men aged 60-64 years in Africa and the Caribbean, but death rates and rank may vary by region. Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause in the Caribbean.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417435","annotations":[{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.916137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Caribbean","weight":0.669298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.416564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"}]}
