{"id":33042,"title":"Papillary endothelial hyperplasia in association with vascular malformation of the hand.","abstract":"Vascular malformations are uncommonly encountered in the hand. This case report involves the unique case of a rapidly enlarging mass associated with a known vascular malformation. Final pathology revealed dense reactive fibrous tissue, with prominent blood vessels, consistent with a venous malformation and associated papillary endothelial hyperplasia. The intraoperative finding of two separately identifiable masses, one fibrotic and one vascular, has not previously been reported.
