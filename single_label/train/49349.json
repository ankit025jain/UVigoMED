The programe is based on objective estimation with a real scale viewing of the wound area and permit to measure area of wound, owing any form. The programe is highly effective during the process of dynamical estimation of the treatment quality.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923117","annotations":[{"name":"Ukraine","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.146078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"University","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Institute of technology","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Performance indicator","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
