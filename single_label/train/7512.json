{"id":7512,"title":"Does long-term use of silver nanoparticles have persistent inhibitory effect on H. pylori based on Mongolian gerbil's model?","abstract":"It is urgent to find alternative agents due to increasing failure rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. The study surveyed the long-term effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) on H. pylori based on Mongolian gerbil's model.Fifty gerbils were randomly allocated to six groups (A-F). Group (Gr) A: the gerbils were fed with broth; Gr B and D: the gerbils were fed with AgNP/clay complex (0.1% of weight); Gr C and E: the gerbils were fed with AgNP/clay complex(1% of weight); and Gr D, E, and F: the gerbils were inoculated with H. pylori. At the 20th experimental week, the gerbils were sacrificed. Histology was evaluated according to the classification of the Sydney system. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.The AgNP/clay has more obvious inhibitory effect on H. pylori in vitro. There was a trend of higher concentrations of AgNP with stronger inhibitory effect on H. pylori growth (P = 0.071). There were no significant differences of inflammation among groups D, E, and F (P = 0.688).AgNP/clay would be a potential and safe agent for inhibiting H. pylori. It should be helpful for eradication of H. pylori infection.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864246","annotations":[{"name":"Silver","weight":0.598453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.565255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.564018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.469715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.444126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.171377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Silver nanoparticles","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nanoparticles"},{"name":"Sydney","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"688","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/688"},{"name":"Gerbil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbil"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Mongolian gerbil","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_gerbil"},{"name":"Mongols","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Human sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice"}]}
