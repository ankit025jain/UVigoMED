{"id":44279,"title":"[A case of unresected gastric cancer that maintained long tumor dormancy by use of paclitaxel+S-1 combination therapy].","abstract":"Here we report a case of unresected gastric cancer that maintained long tumor dormancy by use of paclitaxel+S-1 combination therapy. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for peritoneal dissemination of unresectable gastric cancer. The patient further showed ileus with peritoneal dissemination in computed tomography(CT), and we performed resection of the intestine to release the stenosis. In addition, combination chemotherapy using paclitaxel(60mg/m2, weekly) and S-1(80mg/m2, every 2 weeks)was started after the operation. The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 3 days after the operation, and we continued combination chemotherapy as an outpatient over the following 3 years without serious side effects. Furthermore, tumor makers for gastric cancer were stable, although we could not examine tumor size since the patient rejected examinations such as CT. After 3 years, the patient was admitted to the hospital with cholecystitis, and we were able to evaluate the benefit of the chemotherapy against gastric cancer. The tumor size clearly remained unchanged compared to previous measurements, suggesting that the tumor maintained dormancy in this case.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743206","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.917307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.837704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Ileus","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileus"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.622417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.35107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0354391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"}]}
