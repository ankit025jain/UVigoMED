{"id":70189,"title":"[Inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde on invasion capacities of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435S and its relation with regulating the expression of miR-27a].","abstract":"To explore the inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde on invasion capacities of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435S and its relation with regulating the expression of miR-27a.The effect of cinnamaldehyde on invasive capacities of MDA-MB-435S was measured by Transwell matrigel invasion assay. The effect of miR-27a expression on invasive capabilities of MDA-MB-435S, the intervention of cinnamaldehyde in the miR-27a expression, and its relation with its effect on invasive capabilities were defected with liposome 2000 transinfection miRNA27a mimics/inhibitors, real time-polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR), and Transwell chamber model.Compared with the control group, the number of cells passing through the transwell chamber was more significantly reduced after treated by cinnamaldehyde for 12 h (P < 0.05). The miR-27a expression was 962.07 times and 40% of that of the control group after transinfected by miR-27a mimics and miR-27a inhibitors. After transinfected by miR-27a inhibitors, the number of cells passing through the transwell chamber was more significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The miR-27a expression of MDA-MB-435S was down-regulated by 12-h treatment of cinnamaldehyde (2(-deltaCt) = 0.56, 0.18, 0.18, respectively). The number of miR-27a mimics transinfection pretreated MDA-MB-435S cells passing through the transwell chamber increased more obviously than the number of un-pretreated MDA-MB-435S cells in the control group (P < 0.05).Cinnamaldehyde could inhibit invasive capabilities of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435S. The over-expression of miR-27a played an important role in the invasive capability of MDA-MB-435S. The inhibition of cinnamaldehyde on invasive capabilities of MDA-MB-435S cells was correlated with down-regulating the expression of miR-27a.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223182","annotations":[{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.770479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.338127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cinnamaldehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamaldehyde"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"962","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/962"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Defection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defection"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
