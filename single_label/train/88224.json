{"id":88224,"title":"Radiographic outcomes of percutaneous pinning for displaced extra-articular fractures of the distal radius: a time course study.","abstract":"Although not all malunited distal radius fractures are symptomatic, the goal of treatment for displaced extra-articular fractures of the distal radius should be to restore and to maintain the radial geometry until bone healing. However, the time course change after surgery for these fractures is unclear.We, therefore, performed a retrospective cohort study on patients who sustained such fractures treated with percutaneous pinning. The main outcome measures in this study included four radiographic measurements: radial height, radial inclination, radial tilt, and ulnar variance.Assessment of the monthly changes in these measurements revealed that early fracture collapse with loss of the reduced radial tilt occurred. Besides, among the 4 measurements, the normal radial tilt was the most difficult to be achieved when repositioning and pinning the fractured fragments.Even though the modified Kapandji technique provided a superior ability to maintain the reduced position until bone healing over the Willenegger method, we recommended that refinement of surgical techniques and postoperative hand care program may be necessary to fulfill the treatment objectives of stable surgical fixation and early joint motion.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24883316","annotations":[{"name":"Distal","weight":0.814836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.65653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.364247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Pin (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
