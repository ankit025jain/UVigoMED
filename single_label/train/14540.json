{"id":14540,"title":"[Effect of Panax notoginseng saponins on cytokines in liver fibrosis rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on cytokines production in liver fibrosis rats and its mechanism.SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, including normal group, liver fibrosis model group, PNS (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) treated groups and Col group. Rat liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 twice a week for 18 weeks. PNS were administered daily from the 9th week for 10 weeks. The IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha level in serum were determined by radioimmunity. The degree of liver fibrosis was observed by HE and immuninochemistry. The expression of TGF-beta, TNF-alpha mRNA were detected by RT-PCR technology.Compared with the fibrotic model group, PNS (100, 200 mg/kg) could not only significantly reduce histopathological change, but also effectively decrease the level of IL-1, IL-6, NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha ,TGF-beta, and increase the level of IL-10.PNS has protective effect on liver fibrosis and it maybe related to regulating cytokine network.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417151","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.646638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.626444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.544251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.470539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.288064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.247495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Panax pseudoginseng","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panax_pseudoginseng"},{"name":"NFkappaB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFkappaB"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
