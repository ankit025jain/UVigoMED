{"id":13478,"title":"Pantothenic acid deficiency may increase the urinary excretion of 2-oxo acids and nicotinamide catabolites in rats.","abstract":"Pantothenic acid (PaA) is involved in the metabolism of amino acids as well as fatty acid. We investigated the systemic metabolism of amino acids in PaA-deficient rats. For this purpose, urine samples were collected and 2-oxo acids and L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and its metabolites including nicotinamide were measured. Group 1 was freely fed a conventional chemically-defined complete diet and used as an ad lib-fed control, which group was used for showing reference values. Group 2 was freely fed the complete diet without PaA (PaA-free diet) and used as a PaA-deficient group. Group 3 was fed the complete diet, but the daily food amount was equal to the amount of the PaA-deficient group and used as a pair-fed control group. All rats were orally administered 100 mg of L-Trp/kg body weight at 09:00 on day 34 of the experiment and the following 24-h urine samples were collected. The urinary excretion of the sum of pyruvic acid and oxaloacetic acid was higher in rats fed the PaA-free diets than in the rats fed pair-fed the complete diet. PaA deficiency elicited the increased urinary excretion of anthranilic acid and kynurenic acid, while the urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid decreased. The urinary excretion of L-Trp itself, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid revealed no differences between the rats fed the PaA-free and pair-fed the complete diets. PaA deficiency elicited the increased excretion of N(1)-methylnicotinamide, N(1)-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and N(1)-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide. These findings suggest that PaA deficiency disturbs the amino acid catabolism.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Animal
