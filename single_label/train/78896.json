{"id":78896,"title":"[Which colours can we hear?: light stimulation of the hearing system].","abstract":"The success of conventional hearing aids and electrical auditory prostheses for hearing impaired patients is still limited in noisy environments and for sounds more complex than speech (e. g. music). This is partially due to the difficulty of frequency-specific activation of the auditory system using these devices. Stimulation of the auditory system using light pulses represents an alternative to mechanical and electrical stimulation. Light is a source of energy that can be very exactly focused and applied with little scattering, thus offering perspectives for optimal activation of the auditory system. Studies investigating light stimulation of sectors along the auditory pathway have shown stimulation of the auditory system is possible using light pulses. However, further studies and developments are needed before a new generation of light stimulation-based auditory prostheses can be made available for clinical application.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549506","annotations":[{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.65626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.623998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.582909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.533551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Noise (electronics)","weight":0.496729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.473076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.310182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.309804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.294333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.292283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pulse (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
