{"id":65992,"title":"G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK5 phosphorylates moesin and regulates metastasis in prostate cancer.","abstract":"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) regulate diverse cellular functions ranging from metabolism to growth and locomotion. Here, we report an important contributory role for GRK5 in human prostate cancer. Inhibition of GRK5 kinase activity attenuated the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells and, concordantly, increased cell attachment and focal adhesion formation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphoproteome revealed the cytoskeletal-membrane attachment protein moesin as a putative GRK5 substrate. GRK5 regulated the subcellular distribution of moesin and colocalized with moesin at the cell periphery. We identified amino acid T66 of moesin as a principal GRK5 phosphorylation site and showed that enforcing the expression of a T66-mutated moesin reduced cell spreading. In a xenograft model of human prostate cancer, GRK5 silencing reduced tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Taken together, our results established GRK5 as a key contributor to the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755472","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.78599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.403212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Focal adhesion","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion"},{"name":"Animal locomotion","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Moesin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moesin"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
