{"id":56733,"title":"Anti-VEGF treatment in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a treat-and-extend protocol over 2 years.","abstract":"To evaluate 2-year visual acuity outcome of a treat-and-extend protocol of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment in age-related macular degeneration.In this prospective cohort study, 120 age-related macular degeneration patients with choroidal neovascularization received 3 initial monthly ranibizumab or bevacizumab injections; monthly injections were continued until there was no choroidal neovascularization activity (subretinal/intraretinal fluid, loss of >5 letters, or persistent/recurrent retinal hemorrhage). When there was no choroidal neovascularization activity, the interval to the next visit/injection was extended by 2 weeks to a maximum of 12 weeks. In the presence of choroidal neovascularization activity, this interval was shortened by 2 weeks. Main outcome measures included the percentage losing <15 letters and the mean visual acuity change after 12 months and 24 months.Mean baseline visual acuity was 51.2 ± 12.1 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scores. Mean visual acuity change from baseline was +9.5 ± 10.9 and +8.0 ± 12.9 letters after 12 months and 24 months, respectively, with, on average, 8.6 ± 1.1 visits/injections in the first year and 5.6 ± 2.0 in the second year. After 12 months and 24 months, 97.5% and 95.0% of patients, respectively, lost <15 letters.The \"inject-and-extend\" protocol-with fewer injections and visits-delivered outcomes comparable to those of the pivotal clinical trials of monthly ranibizumab.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637667","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.789788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.780562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.674301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.65303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.52625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.502995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.167499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.127975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.116923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Retinal haemorrhage","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_haemorrhage"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"}]}
