{"id":85876,"title":"Identification of a novel HLA-A 02:01-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope derived from the EML4-ALK fusion gene.","abstract":"Cancer immunotherapy is a promising new approach to cancer treatment. It has been demonstrated that a high number of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is associated with increased disease-specific survival in lung cancer patients. Identification of superior CTL epitopes from tumor antigens is essential for the development of immunotherapy for malignant tumors. The EML4-ALK fusion gene was recently identified in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). In this study we searched for HLA-A 02:01- and HLA-A 24:02?restricted epitopes derived from EML4-ALK by screening predicted EML4-ALK?derived candidate peptides for the induction of tumor?reactive CTLs. Nine EML4-ALK?derived peptides were selected by a computer algorithm based on a permissive HLA-A 02:01 or HLA-A 24:02 binding motif. One of the nine peptides induced peptide-specific CTLs from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We were able to generate a peptide?specific CTL clone. This CTL clone specifically recognized peptide?pulsed T2 cells and H2228 cells expressing HLA-A 02:01 and EML4-ALK that had been treated with IFN-? 48 h prior to examination. CTL activity was inhibited by an anti-HLA?class I monoclonal antibody (W6/32), consistent with a class I-restricted mechanism of cytotoxicity. These results suggest that this peptide (RLSALESRV) is a novel HLA-A 02:01-restricted CTL epitope and that it may be a new target for antigen-specific immunotherapy against EML4?ALK-positive cancers.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842630","annotations":[{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.875095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.863726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.617126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.493514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.476426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0606567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"}]}
