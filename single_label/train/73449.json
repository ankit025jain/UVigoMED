{"id":73449,"title":"Organometallic nucleoside analogues with ferrocenyl linker groups: synthesis and cancer cell line studies.","abstract":"Examples of organometallic compounds as nucleoside analogues are rare within the field of medicinal bioorganometallic chemistry. We report on the synthesis and properties of two chiral ferrocene derivatives containing a nucleobase and a hydroxyalkyl group. These so-called ferronucleosides show promising anticancer activity, with cytostatic studies on five different cancer cell lines indicating that both functional groups are required for optimal activity.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905419","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleobase","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.748727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Chirality (chemistry)","weight":0.730973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.714279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.686078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Ferrocene","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrocene"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.533609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.461296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Organometallic chemistry","weight":0.387949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organometallic_chemistry"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.171605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Nucleoside analogue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_analogue"},{"name":"Bioorganometallic chemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioorganometallic_chemistry"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Linker (computing)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
