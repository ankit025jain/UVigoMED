{"id":56176,"title":"Cell and gene therapy.","abstract":"Replacement or repair of a dysfunctional gene combined with promoting cell survival is a two-pronged approach that addresses an unmet need in the therapy of retinal degenerative diseases. In this chapter, we discuss various strategies toward achieving both goals: transplantation of wild-type cells to replace degenerating cells and to rescue gene function, sequential gene and cell therapy, and in vivo reprogramming of rods to cones. These approaches highlight cutting-edge advances in cell and gene therapy, and cellular lineage conversion in order to devise new therapies for various retinal degenerative diseases.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732770","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rod cell","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Fate mapping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_mapping"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Reprogramming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprogramming"},{"name":"Cone cell","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Chapter (religion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)"}]}
