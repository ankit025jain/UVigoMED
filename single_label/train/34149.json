{"id":34149,"title":"Inter-relationship between electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy and QT prolongation as predictors of increased risk of mortality in the general population.","abstract":"Prolonged-QT commonly coexists in the ECG with left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH). However, it is unclear whether to what extent QT prolongation coexisting with ECG-LVH can explain the prognostic significance of ECG-LVH, and whether prolonged-QT coexisting with ECG-LVH should be considered as an innocent consequence of ECG-LVH.The study population consisted of 7506 participants (mean age, 59.4Â±13.3 years; 49% whites; and 47% men) from the US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ECG-LVH was defined by Cornell voltage criteria. Prolonged heart-rate-adjusted QT (prolonged-QTa) was defined as QTa?460 ms in women or 450 ms in men. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the risk of all-cause mortality for various combinations of ECG-LVH and prolonged-QTa. ECG-LVH was present in 4.2% (N=312) of the participants, of whom 16.4% had prolonged-QTa. In a multivariable-adjusted model and compared with the group without ECG-LVH or prolonged-QTa, mortality risk was highest in the group with concomitant ECG-LVH and prolonged-QTa (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.36), followed by isolated ECG-LVH (1.48; 1.24-1.77), and then isolated prolonged-QTa (1.27; 1.12-1.46). In models with similar adjustment where ECG-LVH and prolonged-QTa were entered as 2 separate variables and subsequently additionally adjusted for each other, the mortality risk was essentially unchanged for both variables.Although prolonged-QT commonly coexists with LVH, both are independent markers of poor prognosis. Concomitant presence of prolonged-QT and ECG-LVH carries a higher risk than either predictor alone.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762807","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.56664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.456203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.167041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Voltage","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.122452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Cornell University","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Q (New York City Subway service)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(New_York_City_Subway_service)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
