{"id":65977,"title":"The evolution of the inflatable penile prosthetic device and surgical innovations with anatomical considerations.","abstract":"Historically, early surgical treatment for erectile dysfunction involved the placement of rigid devices outside of the corpora cavernosa. This practice resulted in high rates of erosion and infection. Today, most urologists in the United States place an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) with an infection-retardant coating inside the corpora cavernosa. In addition to changes in the type of implant used, surgical techniques have evolved greatly in recent years, resulting in reduced operating times, lower infection rates, and improved outcomes. However, anatomical considerations have directed the prosthetic surgeon to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction rates by employing both new surgical techniques and postoperative maneuvers.
