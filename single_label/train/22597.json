{"id":22597,"title":"ATG induction in renal transplant recipients: Long-term hazard of severe infection is associated with long-term functional T cell impairment but not the ATG-induced CD4 cell decline.","abstract":"We showed previously that rabbit ATG induction induces a strong decrease of CD4+ T cells together with impaired in vitro IL-2 secretion up to 1 year post-transplant. To further characterize long-term immunological effects of ATG induction 2 and 5 years post-transplant, we used sensitive intracellular cytokine analysis in the same prospective study of 84 renal transplant recipients (ATG, n=44).A significantly increased frequency of severe infectious disease (HR=2.0, p=0.027) as well as suppressed T cell functions were found within 2 years after ATG induction but not beyond (logistic regression (logreg): CD4 cell IL-10 responses, p=0.064; T cell proliferation, p=0.038). Impaired T cell proliferation at 2 years was associated with occurrence of severe infection (p=0.017). Importantly, a strong and persistent decrease of CD4 cell counts (p<0.0005 at 5 years) was independently associated with ATG induction (logreg p=0.002) but not related to functional CD4 cell impairment (helper activity/cytokine production) or an increased risk of infection.Severe infection up to 2 years after ATG induction was associated with impaired T cell proliferative capacity but not with the profound decline in CD4 cell counts that occurred after ATG induction and persisted up to 5 years.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530759","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.834977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.815853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.814154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.653128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.306057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.172395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
