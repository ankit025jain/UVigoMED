{"id":80069,"title":"In vitro and in vivo antileishmania activity of sesquiterpene lactone-rich dichloromethane fraction obtained from Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Schultz-Bip.","abstract":"The discovery of new treatments for neglected diseases, including leishmaniasis, is a substantial challenge for scientific research. Plant extracts have shown potential in the selective treatment of tropical diseases. The present study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antileishmania effects of a sesquiterpene lactone-rich dichloromethane fraction (DF) obtained from the aerial parts of Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Schultz-Bip. In vitro studies of the DF indicated an IC50 of 2.40±0.76 ?g mL(-1) against the promastigote form and 1.76±0.25 ?g mL(-1) against the axenic amastigote form of Leishmania amazonensis. In vivo intramuscular treatment with DF decreased the growth and size of footpad lesions in mice. The DF also significantly decreased the parasite population compared with animals that were treated with the reference drug. Plasma malondialdehyde levels were increased slightly by the DF, attributable to its parthenolide-rich composition that causes cellular apoptosis, compared with the control group, demonstrating treatment efficacy without toxicity or genotoxicity. Because the isolation and purification of plant compounds are costly and time-consuming and generate low yields, extract fractions, such as the DF studied herein, represent a promising alternative for the treatment of leishmaniasis.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Parasitic
