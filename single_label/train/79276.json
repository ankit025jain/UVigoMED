{"id":79276,"title":"Measures of the electrically evoked compound action potential threshold and slope in HiRes 90K(TM) users.","abstract":"To investigate electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) measured with the neural response imaging (NRI) 'SmartNRI' algorithm. NRI thresholds and slopes were examined according to three aspects: (1) site along the cochlea, (2) development of responses over time, and (3) influence of age/duration of deafness.Thirty-four individuals implanted with the Advanced Bionics HiRes 90K(TM) device were included. The eCAP recordings were made from four electrodes along the array at first fitting and at frequent intervals up to at least 2 years. Slope and threshold (tNRI) of the amplitude growth function were measured and a range of explanatory variables were tested for significant effects on these measures using multi-factorial analysis of variance.Electrode position emerged as a significant effect for the tNRI measure, with lowest thresholds at the apical end of the array. Mean slope was greatest for the most apical electrode, but not significantly. Slope was significantly influenced by onset of deafness, with congenital hearing loss associated with steeper slopes than acquired hearing loss. There was also a highly significant effect of duration of device use, with a gradual increase in slope over the 2 years following device activation.The observed effects of electrode position are consistent with a model in which eCAP threshold is governed primarily by an effect of distance between electrode and neural interface (which is shorter towards the apex of the cochlea) and in which slope is governed primarily by density of surviving neural elements.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
