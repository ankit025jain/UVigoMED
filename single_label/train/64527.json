{"id":64527,"title":"[Anti-NMDA receptor antibody in systemic lupus erythematosus].","abstract":"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels with crucial roles in synaptic transmission and central nervous system plasticity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-system inflammatory disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against double-stranded (ds) DNA. The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric (NP) SLE is diverse and complicated. In SLE, anti-dsDNA antibody (Ab) cross-reacts with NMDA receptors. Serum anti-NMDA receptor Ab was found in 30% of SLE patients. We demonstrated the relationship between anti-NMDA receptor Ab and each organ's involvement in SLE, and the biological function of anti-NMDA receptor Ab. The frequency of NP-SLE was significantly higher in the anti-NMDA receptor Ab positive subset than the negative subset, although the frequencies of serositis and nephritis were not significant. Anti-NMDA receptor Ab titer inversely correlated with leukocyte counts and hemoglobin levels. Moreover, regarding to the effects of anti-NMDA receptor Ab on NMDA receptor-transfected cell viability and intracellular Ca2+ level, there was a significant inverse correlation between anti-NMDA receptor Ab titer and cell viability, and a significant association between anti-NMDA receptor Ab titer and intracellular Ca2+ level. In conclusion, anti-NMDA receptor Ab is associated with NP-SLE and cytopenia. Anti-NMDA receptor Ab could cause the injury of NMDA receptor-expressed cells by increasing Ca2+ influx.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069262","annotations":[{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.832728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.798359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.788923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.763952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.661769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.620071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.462795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.155912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
