{"id":37352,"title":"[Pain in the neonatal period II. non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment].","abstract":"In their postnatal development the newborns are often exposed to the influence of procedural and repetitive painful stimuli that worsen their status. This requires the implementation of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment. Aim - to explore the literature data on the possibilities of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment methods which are implemented to reduce and control pain in neonatal period. Some of the non-pharmacological strategies are the priority of the personnel who gives care of newborns (swaddling, nonnutritive sucking, usage of sweet solution, etc.) Ever more is discussed the participation of mother(parents)in the care of her child's comfort and pain reduction. The breastfeeding and \"kangaroo\" care additionally reduce negative effects of pain. The importance of the music continues to be explored. The principles of pharmacological therapy include: control of procedure pain, its treatment during mechanical ventilation and at the time and after surgical intervention which is based on analgesia. Specificities of the pharmacotherapy of newborns and premature infants require careful application of the medications and additional studies on these children.The elimination of neonatal pain and its negative effects on the newborn is achieved by applying different strategies. Non-pharmacological methods reduce pain stimuli and ensure the child's comfort and the pharmacological methods block and eliminate the pain. Most often a combination of them is used in practice.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501878","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.819178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.507022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.388387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Kangaroo care","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_care"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.208234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Kangaroo","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo"},{"name":"Swaddling","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaddling"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
