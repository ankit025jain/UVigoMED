{"id":51149,"title":"Review of outcomes after cessation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment of girls with precocious puberty.","abstract":"Although gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been the standard of care of central precocious puberty (CPP) management for many years, there are still questions about the long-term consequences of treatment. With increased utilization of GnRHa treatment, it is now possible to assess posttreatment outcomes in the immediate posttreatment period and into adulthood. This literature review reports on the long-term effects of GnRHa therapy in girls with CPP after therapy has been discontinued. Published reports confirm the reversibility of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis suppression in females after cessation of GnRHa therapy, with the majority of patients achieving ovulatory menstrual cycles of normal timing and duration. GnRHa therapy does not appear to induce polycystic ovary syndrome or have long-term negative repercussions on either bone mineral density or body composition. Evidence is currently insufficient to identify agent-specific differences in outcomes, reproductive function, and health of offspring.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719967","annotations":[{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.85772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.627383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.611652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.534308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.499217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.374405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"}]}
