{"id":33563,"title":"Defective mitophagy in XPA via PARP-1 hyperactivation and NAD(+)/SIRT1 reduction.","abstract":"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature in neurodegeneration and aging. We identify mitochondrial dysfunction in xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), a nucleotide excision DNA repair disorder with severe neurodegeneration, in silico and in vivo. XPA-deficient cells show defective mitophagy with excessive cleavage of PINK1 and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondrial abnormalities appear to be caused by decreased activation of the NAD(+)-SIRT1-PGC-1? axis triggered by hyperactivation of the DNA damage sensor PARP-1. This phenotype is rescued by PARP-1 inhibition or by supplementation with NAD(+) precursors that also rescue the lifespan defect in xpa-1 nematodes. Importantly, this pathogenesis appears common to ataxia-telangiectasia and Cockayne syndrome, two other DNA repair disorders with neurodegeneration, but absent in XPC, a DNA repair disorder without neurodegeneration. Our findings reveal a nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk that is critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial health.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813611","annotations":[{"name":"In silico","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Xeroderma pigmentosum","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeroderma_pigmentosum"},{"name":"Cockayne syndrome","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockayne_syndrome"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.735177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.656402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.537438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mitochondrial disease","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_disease"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.352865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.253971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.156261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Crosstalk (biology)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"PARP1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARP1"},{"name":"PINK1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PINK1"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
