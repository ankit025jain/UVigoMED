{"id":35949,"title":"Maternal depression, antidepressant prescriptions, and congenital anomaly risk in offspring: a population-based cohort study.","abstract":"To estimate risks of major congenital anomaly (MCA) among children of mothers prescribed antidepressants during early pregnancy or diagnosed with depression but without antidepressant prescriptions.Population-based cohort study.Linked UK maternal-child primary care records.A total of 349,127 singletons liveborn between 1990 and 2009.Odds ratios adjusted for maternal sociodemographics and comorbidities (aORs) were calculated for MCAs, comparing women with first-trimester selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and women with diagnosed but unmedicated depression, or women without diagnosed depression.Fourteen system-specific MCA groups classified according to the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies and five specific heart anomaly groups.Absolute risks of MCA were 2.7% (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 2.6-2.8%) in children of mothers without diagnosed depression, 2.8% (95% CI 2.5-3.2%) in children of mothers with unmedicated depression, and 2.7% (95% CI 2.2-3.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI 2.2-4.1%) in children of mothers with SSRIs or TCAs, respectively. Compared with women without depression, MCA overall was not associated with unmedicated depression (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.18), SSRIs (aOR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88-1.17), or TCAs (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.87-1.38). Paroxetine was associated with increased heart anomalies (absolute risk 1.4% in the exposed group compared with 0.8% in women without depression; aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.09-2.88), which decreased marginally when compared with women with diagnosed but unmedicated depression (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.00-2.80).Overall MCA risk did not increase with maternal depression or with antidepressant prescriptions. Paroxetine was associated with increases of heart anomalies, although this could represent a chance finding from a large number of comparisons undertaken.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612301","annotations":[{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Paroxetine","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Tricyclic antidepressant","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.757614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.67285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.573412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.539832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tricyclic","weight":0.26327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.227691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.177717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Absolute risk reduction","weight":0.147269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_risk_reduction"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.133824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0337306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Teenage pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy"}]}
