{"id":54216,"title":"Asymmetric dimethyl L-arginine, nitric oxide and cardiovascular disease in adolescent type 1 diabetics.","abstract":"To evaluate asymmetric dimethyl L-arginine (ADMA), nitric oxide (NO) and cardiovascular disease in adolescent type 1 diabetics.The study included 62 type 1 diabetic patients and 30 healthy volunteers of the same age and sex. Blood samples were taken for assessment of ADMA, NO, oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL), glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid profile. Urine samples were taken for assessment of albumin/creatinine ratio. M mode echocardiography and flow mediated dilatation (FMD) via ultrasound were completed; t-test for independent variables, Pearson's correlation, and stepwise multiple regression analysis were used.The mean age of patients was 16.3±1.5 years and mean duration of diabetes was 9.4±2.9 years. Nitric oxide, ADMA and FMD were significantly lower, while OxLDL and the albumin/creatinine ratio were significantly higher in diabetics. Nitric oxide had a significant negative correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular end-systolic dimension, posterior wall thickness, left ventricular mass, albumin/creatinine ratio, and OxLDL, as well as a positive correlation with ADMA. Albumin/creatinine ratio had a significant positive correlation with OxLDL and negative correlation with ADMA. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that ADMA is the only parameter related to NO, however, albumin/creatinine ratio and OxLDL are related to ADMA.Type 1 diabetic patients had endothelial and diastolic dysfunction. The reduction in NO, ADMA, and elevation of OxLDL, and its relation to echocardiographic data and albumin/creatinine ratio, may reflect their role in cardiac and renal affection.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468606","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric
