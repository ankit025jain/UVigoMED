{"id":53827,"title":"Interaction of tumour cells with their microenvironment: ion channels and cell adhesion molecules. A focus on pancreatic cancer.","abstract":"Cancer must be viewed as a 'tissue', constituted of both transformed cells and a heterogeneous microenvironment, the 'tumour microenvironment' (TME). The TME undergoes a complex remodelling during the course of multistep tumourigenesis, hence strongly contributing to tumour progression. Ion channels and transporters (ICTs), being expressed on both tumour cells and in the different cellular components of the TME, are in a strategic position to sense and mediate signals arising from the TME. Often, this transmission is mediated by integrin adhesion receptors, which are the main cellular receptors capable of mediating cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix bidirectional signalling. Integrins can often operate in conjunction with ICT because they can behave as functional partners of ICT proteins. The role of integrin receptors in the crosstalk between tumour cells and the TME is particularly relevant in the context of pancreatic cancer (PC), characterized by an overwhelming TME which actively contributes to therapy resistance. We discuss the possibility that this occurs through integrins and ICTs, which could be exploited as targets to overcome chemoresistance in PC.
