{"id":85592,"title":"Brown Norway and Zucker Lean rats demonstrate circadian variation in ventilation and sleep apnea.","abstract":"Circadian rhythms influence many biological systems, but there is limited information about circadian and diurnal variation in sleep related breathing disorder. We examined circadian and diurnal patterns in sleep apnea and ventilatory patterns in two rat strains, one with high sleep apnea propensity (Brown Norway [BN]) and the other with low sleep apnea propensity (Zucker Lean [ZL]).Chronically instrumented rats were randomized to breathe room air (control) or 100% oxygen (hyperoxia), and we performed 20-h polysomnography beginning at Zeitgeber time 4 (ZT 4; ZT 0 = lights on, ZT12 = lights off). We examined the effect of strain and inspired gas (twoway analysis of variance) and analyzed circadian and diurnal variability.Strain and inspired gas-dependent differences in apnea index (AI; apneas/h) were particularly prominent during the light phase. AI in BN rats (control, 16.9 ± 0.9; hyperoxia, 34.0 ± 5.8) was greater than in ZL rats (control, 8.5 ± 1.0; hyperoxia, 15.4 ± 1.1, [strain effect, P < 0.001; gas effect, P = 0.001]). Hyperoxia reduced respiratory frequency in both strains, and all respiratory pattern variables demonstrated circadian variability. BN rats exposed to hyperoxia demonstrated the largest circadian fluctuation in AI (amplitude = 17.9 ± 3.7 apneas/h [strain effect, P = 0.01; gas effect, P < 0.001; interaction, P = 0.02]; acrophase = 13.9 ± 0.7 h; r (2) = 0.8 ± 1.4).Inherited, environmental, and circadian factors all are important elements of underlying sleep related breathing disorder. Our method to examine sleep related breathing disorder phenotypes in rats may have implications for understanding vulnerability for sleep related breathing disorder in humans.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract
