{"id":86970,"title":"Rubella in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"In 2004, Poland has adopted the WHO goal of rubella elimination and congenital rubella syndrome prevention. Participation in the rubella elimination program requires clinical diagnosis of rubella to be confirmed with laboratory test. In Poland, until 2003, national vaccination recommendation included a dose of rubella vaccine only for girls aged 13 years. Among men, the incidence of measles remained high creating a risk of infection of non-immune pregnant women which may lead to the development of congenital rubella syndrome in the child.To assess epidemiological situation of rubella in Poland in 2012, including vaccination coverage in Polish population.The descriptive analysis was based on data retrieved from routine mandatory surveillance system and published in the annual bulletins \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2012\".In 2012, there was a significant increase in the number of cases of rubella - 6 263 cases (in 2011, 4 290 cases) - and the increase in incidence (from 11.1 per 100 thousand. 16.3). The highest incidence rate, regardless of gender and the environment, was observed among adolescents aged 15-19 years (118.0 per 100 000). As in 2011, the incidence of rubella in boys and men was higher than the incidence in girls and women (25.6 versus 7.5). In 2012, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome were registered.The proportion of laboratory tests confirming/excluding rubella infection is still very low in Poland. In 2012, only 0.2% of rubella cases were laboratory confirmed.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135498","annotations":[{"name":"Measles","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles"},{"name":"Rubella","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.553926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.504449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.453709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.333154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.239055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Congenital rubella syndrome","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_rubella_syndrome"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Poles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"United States presidential election, 2004","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
