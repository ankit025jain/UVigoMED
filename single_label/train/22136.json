{"id":22136,"title":"Dacryolith-induced acute dacryocystitis: a reversible cause of nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","abstract":"To report an unusual case of acute dacryocystits with fully patent nasolacrimal duct at follow-up after incision and curettage.A 63-year-old patient with acute dacryocystitis and nasolacrimal duct abscess. CT orbits confirmed dacryocystitis without any orbital collection. Incision and drainage of the abscess was performed.Postoperative syringing of nasolacrimal duct demonstrated a fully patent nasolacrimal duct, with long term relief of epiphora.In some patients, dacryocystorhinostomy is not required after incision and drainage of a nasolacrimal abscess; reversible causes such as dacryoliths should always be considered.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568662","annotations":[{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Nasolacrimal duct","weight":0.201923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0510965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0495813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Dacryocystorhinostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystorhinostomy"},{"name":"Dacryocystitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystitis"},{"name":"Epiphora (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphora_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incision and drainage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incision_and_drainage"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Welland Canal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welland_Canal"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 63","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_63"}]}
