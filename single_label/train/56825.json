{"id":56825,"title":"[Clinical course and vital prognosis for uveal melanoma in young patients].","abstract":"The article presents a retrospective analysis of uveal melanoma course which was conducted during 2005-2012 and enrolled 21 patients (13 boys and 8 girls) aged from 1 to 20, representing 1.36% of the total number of patients who had been given treatment over that period. Non-pigmented and poorly pigmented tumors were most common. Morphologically the vast majority of cases were spindle cell tumors. It is shown that most patients of this age group are admitted to specialized medical centers at late stages of the disease, which indicates local lack of early detection and proper ophthalmological assessment.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624794","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.322917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.317087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Uveal melanoma","weight":0.267874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveal_melanoma"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.152321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Uvea","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvea"},{"name":"Spindle neuron","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron"}]}
