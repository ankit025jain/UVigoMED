{"id":80060,"title":"[Epidemic analysis of echinococcosis in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province from 2006 to 2011].","abstract":"To provide scientific evidence for further improving of the prevention and control strategies for echinococcosis in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, according to the epidemiological characteristics of echinococcosis surveyed in this prefecture.Data of echinococcosis cases and surveillance information of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture from 2006 to 2011 were downloaded from the National Infectious Diseases Reporting System, and statistically analyzed by using SPSS 19.0 and Epi info3.5 software.A total of 8939 echinococcosis cases was reported during the observed period, the prevalence rate was 818.7/100000, and 88.9% of the patients were herdsmen. Cases distributed in all the 18 counties and counted for 66.8% (217/325) of the townships in Ganzi Prefecture, pasturing and farming-pastoral areas were the highly risk areas. 84.3% cases were reported from Shiqu and Seda Counties, where were the most heavy epidemic regions for echinococcosis prevalence in Sichuan Province. The minimum, maximum and mean age of these cases was 1, 99 and 41 years old. Among them 84.3% were aged from 20 to 60 years old, and the prevalence rate of females was significantly higher than that of males (P<0.01). The serological positive rate of children (P<0.01) and the prevalence rate of livestock in 2011 (P<0.01) was significantly decreased, comparing with that of in 2007, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the positive rates of dog coproantigen in 2011 and 2007 (P > 0.05).The prevalence of echinococcosis in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, was still high, comprehensive prevention and control strategies needed to adopt in the control program in order to reduce the infection of echinococcosis.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Parasitic
