{"id":87359,"title":"Using a TightRope® to treat a complex fracture of the trapezium.","abstract":"We present the case of a 23-year-old man with a combined scaphoid fracture and comminuted trapezium fracture, treated surgically with percutaneous fixation of the scaphoid fracture and concomitant Arthrex Mini TightRope(®) stabilisation of base of thumb metacarpal to base of index finger metacarpal. The patient made a good functional recovery, returning to usual activities within six weeks. We suggest that this technique could be used to treat complex trapezium fractures that cannot be reconstructed with surgery.
