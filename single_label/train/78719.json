{"id":78719,"title":"[Disciplinary decisions about ENT doctors: an overview of the period 1993-2012].","abstract":"We examined the prevalence and consequences of complaints about ENT doctors lodged with the disciplinary board. In the period 1993-2012, 181 disciplinary decisions were made about ENT doctors. Relatively few complaints were made against ENT doctors compared with other medical professions; 16% of the complaints were upheld. Only the lightest measures were taken, such as warnings or reprimands. Seventy-five complaints concerned a medical-technical procedure. When focussing on surgical treatments, the most serious complaints were about endoscopic sinus surgery. In the study period (1993-2012), 448 claims were filed against ENT doctors at the largest Dutch hospital insurer for medical liability. The biggest claims were also related to endoscopic sinus surgery cases. Recommendations are made to improve the quality policy of the Dutch ENT society.
