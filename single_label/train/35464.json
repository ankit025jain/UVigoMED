{"id":35464,"title":"[Health and development of children conceived through assisted reproductive technologies].","abstract":"Around 3% of children are conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) in France. Several questions concerning the early or late follow-up of these children are raised, as there are differences in the population in charge and because of clinical or biological procedures used. Nevertheless, one has to be cautious in interpreting the data as it is difficult to study one factor at a time, and as many other events can bias the results. However, ART is associated with a higher risk, even moderate, of prematurity, foetal hypotrophy, and neo natal complications, as compared to natural conceived children. There is also increasing evidence that ART-conceived children present more epigenetic diseases and congenital mainly concerning cardio-vascular, uro-genital and musculo-skeletal systems, as natural conceived children. Absolute risks remain anyway moderate and reassuring. Long term follow up is encouraging, with correct growth or psychomotor development of these children, and no significant excess of risk for cancer, but it is necessary to carry on this follow up in order to have data on their development to adulthood and on their fertility.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649560","annotations":[{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.81484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.72046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.5439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.543772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.444277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.381316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"France","weight":0.347629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.302656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.202686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
