{"id":73283,"title":"The adenocarcinoma cell surface mucin receptor for alpha-fetoprotein: is the same receptor present on circulating monocytes and macrophages? A commentary.","abstract":"The mucin family of proteins is largely expressed on sedentary epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and reproductive tracts and their associated organs and malignant tumors. It is less well-known that mucins are also expressed on circulatory cells of the immune and inflammatory systems, such as monocytes, macrophages, leukemic, and lymphoma cells. The epithelial mucins function in (a) protection and lubrication of mucosal linings, (b) cell adhesion and cell-to-cell contact, (c) cell migration and metastasis, and (d) signal transduction. It would be logical to presume that mucins expressed on circulating mononuclear cells could perform similar functions. Recently, it was proposed that the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) receptor, known to be present on solid epithelial-derived malignant tumor cells, can be identified as a mucin glycoprotein. Interestingly, it was also reported that AFP binds to a receptor on circulating cells and sedentary tumor cells of lymphoreticular origin, especially monocytes associated with lymphomas and leukemias. The primary objective of the present commentary is to present literature-based evidence that some of the cell surface mucins on sedentary epithelial tumor cells and certain mucins expressed on circulating monocytes/macrophages are identical to the AFP receptor. The secondary objective is to discuss the role of AFP and its derived peptides in the growth suppression of adenocarcinomas and lymphomas using the AFP-mucin receptor concept as a key to the mechanism of tumor growth inhibition.
