{"id":53242,"title":"Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism rs7903146 is associated with stroke in type 2 diabetes patients with long disease duration.","abstract":"Associations between TCF7L2 SNP and diabetic complications and diabetes-related factors were investigated. Subjects with rs7903146 variant had significantly higher prevalence of stroke (24.1% vs. 11.1%; P=0.039) among subjects exhibiting a long disease duration (?10 years). In conclusion, the TCF7L2 SNP variant may confer a higher risk of stroke in diabetic patients.
