{"id":79035,"title":"Laryngeal cancer.","abstract":"Treatment of laryngeal carcinoma continues to evolve, and whereas there was a transition from total laryngectomy to chemoradiation in response to the Veterans Affairs study and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 91-11, recent data suggest the role of partial laryngectomy must be revisited.Recent data have shown that laryngeal preservation does not equate with laryngeal function. Data are accumulating in support of operative management of advanced laryngeal carcinoma away from chemoradiation for select patients. In particular, supracricoid laryngectomy may be a viable option for intermediate and selected advanced laryngeal carcinoma while maintaining laryngeal function.The evolution of treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma is focusing treatment on maintaining locoregional control while also maintaining a functional larynx.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504224","annotations":[{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.751693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.666855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.472261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.463126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.293553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Transition metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"}]}
