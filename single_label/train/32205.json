{"id":32205,"title":"Endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization in infants with hydrocephalus: a retrospective Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network study.","abstract":"The use of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) with choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) has been advocated as an alternative to CSF shunting in infants with hydrocephalus. There are limited reports of this procedure in the North American population, however. The authors provide a retrospective review of the experience with combined ETV + CPC within the North American Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN).All children (< 2 years old) who underwent an ETV + CPC at one of 7 HCRN centers before November 2012 were included. Data were collected retrospectively through review of hospital records and the HCRN registry. Comparisons were made to a contemporaneous cohort of 758 children who received their first shunt at < 2 years of age within the HCRN.Thirty-six patients with ETV + CPC were included (13 with previous shunt). The etiologies of hydrocephalus were as follows: intraventricular hemorrhage of prematurity (9 patients), aqueductal stenosis (8), myelomeningocele (4), and other (15). There were no major intraoperative or early postoperative complications. There were 2 postoperative CSF infections. There were 2 deaths unrelated to hydrocephalus and 1 death from seizure. In 18 patients ETV + CPC failed at a median time of 30 days after surgery (range 4-484 days). The actuarial 3-, 6-, and 12-month success for ETV + CPC was 58%, 52%, and 52%. Time to treatment failure was slightly worse for the 36 patients with ETV + CPC compared with the 758 infants treated with shunts (p = 0.012). Near-complete CPC (? 90%) was achieved in 11 cases (31%) overall, but in 50% (10 of 20 cases) in 2012 versus 6% (1 of 16 cases) before 2012 (p = 0.009). Failure was higher in children with < 90% CPC (HR 4.39, 95% CI 0.999-19.2, p = 0.0501).The early North American multicenter experience with ETV + CPC in infants demonstrates that the procedure has reasonable safety in selected cases. The degree of CPC achieved might be associated with a surgeon's learning curve and appears to affect success, suggesting that surgeon training might improve results.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995823","annotations":[{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.893429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Cauterization","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.794971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Choroid plexus","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid_plexus"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Spina bifida","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.761925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.498004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.411347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.400849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.29426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cerebral aqueduct","weight":0.0847228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_aqueduct"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Communist Party of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China"},{"name":"Plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plexus"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
