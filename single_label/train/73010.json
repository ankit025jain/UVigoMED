{"id":73010,"title":"FET-PET-based reirradiation and chloroquine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma: first tolerability and feasibility results.","abstract":"Treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) remains an unsolved clinical problem. Reirradiation (re-RT) can be used to treat some patients with rGBM, but as a monotherapy it has only limited efficacy. Chloroquine (CQ) is an anti-malaria and immunomodulatory drug that may inhibit autophagy and increase the radiosensitivity of GBM.Between January 2012 and August 2013, we treated five patients with histologically confirmed rGBM with re-RT and 250 mg CQ daily.Treatment was very well tolerated; no CQ-related toxicity was observed. At the first follow-up 2 months after finishing re-RT, two patients achieved partial response (PR), one patient stable disease (SD), and one patient progressive disease (PD). One patient with reirradiated surgical cavity did not show any sign of PD.In this case series, we observed encouraging responses to CQ and re-RT. We plan to conduct a CQ dose escalation study combined with re-RT.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928248","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.699958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.685118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chloroquine","weight":0.585321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.580419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.552683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.375585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Escalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"National Order of Quebec","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Order_of_Quebec"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Radiosensitivity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosensitivity"}]}
