{"id":81216,"title":"Saliva: an overview.","abstract":"An inherent and yet profound aspect of our well-being is dependent on a humble, unassuming fluid called saliva. This unpretentious secretion is indispensable, contributing to quality of life and the simple joy of living; its absence has been described as an aggravating constant misery. Therefore, understanding how saliva contributes to good oral health and general well-being is essential to assisting oral health professionals in their care for patients. A comprehensive literature search of publications relating to saliva was undertaken in order to assemble an overview of the current knowledge of this multifaceted, multipurpose bodily fluid. This paper revises the anatomical, histological and physiological aspects of saliva production and its functions. Dry mouth and its associated risk factors are described, together with consideration of its clinical significance.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265747","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.793125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.516275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.434199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.363444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.250999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Happiness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Filmmaking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"}]}
