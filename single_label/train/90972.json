{"id":90972,"title":"Ulnar tunnel syndrome.","abstract":"Ulnar neuropathy at or distal to the wrist, the so-called ulnar tunnel syndrome, is an uncommon but well-described condition. However, diagnosis of ulnar tunnel syndrome can be difficult. Paresthesias may be nonspecific or related to coexisting pathologies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8-T1 radiculopathy, or peripheral neuropathy, which makes accurate diagnosis challenging. The advances in electrodiagnosis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have improved the diagnostic accuracy. This article offers an updated view of ulnar tunnel syndrome as well as its etiologies, diagnoses, and treatments.
