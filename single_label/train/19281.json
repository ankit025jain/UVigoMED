{"id":19281,"title":"Flower-like ZnO nanostructure based electrochemical DNA biosensor for bacterial meningitis detection.","abstract":"Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures possessing flower-like morphology have been synthesised onto platinized silicon substrate by simple and economical hydrothermal method. The interaction of physically immobilized single stranded thiolated DNA (ss th-DNA) probe of N. meningitides onto the nanostructured ZnO (ZNF) matrix surface have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impeadance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical sensing response behaviour of the DNA bioelectrode (ss th-DNA/ZNF/Pt/Si) has been studied by both differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) as well as impedimetric techniques. The fabricated DNA biosensor can quantify wide range of the complementary target ss th-DNA in the range 5-240 ng ?l(-1) with good linearity (R=0.98), high sensitivity (168.64 ?A ng(-1) ?l cm(-2)) and low detection limit of about 5 ng ?l(-1). Results emphasise that the fabricated flower-like ZnO nanostructures offer a useful platform for the immobilization of DNA molecules and could be exploited for efficient detection of complementary target single stranded DNA corresponding to N. meningitides.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727606","annotations":[{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.908674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Nanostructure","weight":0.889572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanostructure"},{"name":"Biosensor","weight":0.883286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosensor"},{"name":"Silicon","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Zinc oxide","weight":0.741106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_oxide"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Electrochemistry","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.692794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.683537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Cyclic voltammetry","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.386135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Wafer (electronics)","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.287629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.270684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Semiconductor device fabrication","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.0360681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hydrothermal circulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_circulation"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Voltammetry","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltammetry"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Short story","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"SsDNA","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SsDNA"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"}]}
