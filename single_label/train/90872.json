{"id":90872,"title":"Topical use of phytotherapic cream (Capilen® cream) to prevent radiodermatitis in breast cancer: a prospective historically controlled clinical study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a topical phytotherapic product (Capilen® cream) to limit acute radiodermitis and delay the use of corticosteroids in patients with breast cancer (BC).From January 2012 to August 2012, 30 consecutive patients, undergoing radiotherapy with adjuvant intent, were invited to use Capilen® cream two times daily two weeks before and during radiotherapy. An historical group was used as an external control. Acute skin toxicity was scored weekly according to RTOG/EORTC criteria. Time of occurrence of acute skin toxicity was taken as endpoint.Compliance was good. Overall, no significative statistical difference was observed in rate of acute radiation dermatitis, 46.7% in experimental arm versus 63.3% in the historical control group, although only 3.3% of Capilen® cream treated patients had a G3 acute radiation dermatitis versus 10% of the control group. A delay in the onset of radition dermatitis in patients treated with Capilen® cream (P=0.04) was showed.Our findings suggested that Capilen® cream plays a role in reducing acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. Further evidence is needed to confirm these results.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566571","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.536671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.493003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Phytotherapy","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytotherapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.163187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Radiation dermatitis","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_dermatitis"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.0615107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
