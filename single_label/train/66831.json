{"id":66831,"title":"[Advanced prostate cancer in Senegal. Clinical aspects at the General Hospital of Grand Yoff].","abstract":"Prostate cancer is a common disease, which continues to be discovered at advanced stages in Africa, despite improved diagnostic tools.The authors report the experience of the Department of Urology, General Hospital of Grand Yoff Dakar in the diagnostic of advanced prostate cancer.This was a retrospective descriptive study on patients followed for advanced prostate cancer during the period from January 1st, 2004 to May 31st, 2010.There were 102 people aged from 51 to 96 years with an average of 71 ± 9 years. A comorbid condition was associated in 24.5 % of cases. The circumstances of discovery were pain (32 cases), neurological signs (17 cases), and urinary disorders. DRE had objectified an abnormality in all patients. The serum levels of prostate specific antigen ranged from 5.88 ng/mL to 21,660 ng/mL, with an average of 1447.57 ± 812 ng/mL. A prostate biopsy was performed in 44 patients and prostatic adenocarcinoma was found in 97.7 % of cases with Gleason scores greater than 7 (33 cases). We found different metastatic sites at vertebral column (23 cases), at lung (14 cases), and on pelvic bones (11 cases).The prostate cancer is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis is not made early in developing countries. We need a strategic plan to improve the early screening and we should develop supportive care too because of the high number of advanced cases diagnosed in our context.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674331","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.759961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.737533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.599043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.572859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Rectal examination","weight":0.25277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_examination"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.177191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"May 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_31"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}]}
