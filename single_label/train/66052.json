{"id":66052,"title":"[Recognizing pediatric acute kidney injury].","abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a reversible increase in blood concentration of creatinine and nitrogenous waste products and by the inability of the kidney to regulate fluid and electrolyte homeostasis appropriately. AKI in hospitalized patients is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality in pediatric and adult populations. Continued reliance on serum creatinine and urine output for the diagnosis of AKI has resulted in an inability to provide successful therapeutic and supportive interventions to prevent and mitigate AKI. Research efforts over the last decade have foused on the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers to detect AKI prior to a change in kidney function and to make a differential diagnosis of AKI.
