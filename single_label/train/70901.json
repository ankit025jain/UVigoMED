{"id":70901,"title":"Carboplatin dosing for adult Japanese patients.","abstract":"Carboplatin is a platinum-based anticancer drug that has been long used to treat many types of solid cancer. Because the clearance of carboplatin strongly correlates with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), its dosage is calculated with the Calvert formula on the basis of the patient's GFR to achieve the target area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) for each patient. However, many lines of evidence from previous clinical studies should be interpreted with caution because different methods were used to estimate drug clearance and derive the dosage of carboplatin. There is a particularly high risk of carboplatin overdosing when the dosage is determined on the basis of standardized serum creatinine values. When deciding the dose of carboplatin for adult Japanese patients, preferred methods to assess renal function instead of directly measuring GFR include (1) 24-h urinary collection-based creatinine clearance adjusted by adding 0.2 mg/dl to the serum creatinine concentration measured by standardized methods, and (2) equation-based GFR (eGFR) with a back calculation to units of ml/min per subject. Given the limitations of serum creatinine-based GFR estimations, the GFR or creatinine clearance should be directly measured in each patient whenever possible. To ensure patient safety and facilitate a medical-team approach, the single most appropriate method available at each institute or medical team should be consistently used to calculate the dose of carboplatin with the Calvert formula.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129986","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.819147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.658307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.591096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.552443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.541081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.254468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.120202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medicine in medieval Islam","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_in_medieval_Islam"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Calculator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
