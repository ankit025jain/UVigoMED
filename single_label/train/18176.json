{"id":18176,"title":"Individualized risk of surgical-site infection: an application of the breast reconstruction risk assessment score.","abstract":"Risk factors for surgical-site infection following beast reconstruction have been thoroughly investigated at a population level. However, traditional population-based measures may not always capture the nuances of individual patients. The authors aimed to develop a validated breast reconstruction risk assessment calculator for surgical-site infection that informs risk at an individual level.Mastectomies with immediate reconstruction (n = 16,069) from 2005 to 2011 were identified from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. A multiple logistic regression model was created for postoperative surgical-site infection. Hosmer-Lemeshow, C statistic, and Brier score were computed to assess model performance. Bootstrap analysis validated the model.A robust, validated risk model for surgical-site infection was developed using 11 covariates. The model Hosmer-Lemeshow p value was 0.371, the Brier score was 0.0357, and the C statistic was 0.682 (optimism-corrected C statistic, 0.678). The distribution of individual risks demonstrated a positive skew. Population-derived risk underestimated or overestimated individual risk by at least 1.5-fold in nearly one-fifth of all patients.The breast reconstruction risk assessment score risk calculator for surgical-site infection mitigates the potentially inaccurate interpolation of population-based risk to individual patients. The authors concomitantly developed an online interface-accessible by patients and surgeons alike-to quantify a patient's risk for surgical-site infection, better informing evidence-based decisions and managing patient expectations.Risk, III.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814422","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.405277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.133747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Bootstrapping (statistics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Statistic","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Skewness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness"},{"name":"682","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/682"},{"name":"371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Population projection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_projection"},{"name":"Calculator","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Tim Hortons Brier","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons_Brier"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Risk modeling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_modeling"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Interpolation","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation"}]}
