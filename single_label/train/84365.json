{"id":84365,"title":"Repair of recurrent hernia after biologic mesh failure in abdominal wall reconstruction.","abstract":"Biologic mesh is commonly used in abdominal wall reconstruction but may result in increased hernia recurrence. There are minimal data on repair of these recurrent hernias.We conducted a retrospective chart review of 24 patients presenting to a single surgeon with recurrent ventral hernia, previously repaired with biologic mesh.Seventeen of 24 study patients underwent open repair, including 5 revisions of incomplete external oblique release. Mesh was polypropylene in 11 patients and fenestrated condensed polytetrafluoroethylene in 3 patients. In 1 patient, no mesh was used. In 2 patients, bridged biologic mesh was used because of risk of exposure. All biologic repairs have since recurred. Complications occurred in 3 of 15 prosthetic mesh patients and in all biologic mesh patients.Prior components release can be repeated if computed tomography scan reveals incomplete release. Recurrence is common after bridged biologic mesh repair. Conventional mesh can be used safely in many recurrent abdominal hernias after biologic mesh failure.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118163","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.537586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.533638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.489896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.467503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.379879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0366068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Recursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Bridging (networking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Abdominal external oblique muscle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_external_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Condensed matter physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"}]}
