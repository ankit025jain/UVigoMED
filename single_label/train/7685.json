{"id":7685,"title":"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibitor modulates T regulatory and IL-17 cells in the prevention of adjuvant induced arthritis in mice model.","abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major autoimmune diseases of global prevalence. Irrespective of much research in RA disease, no drugs with capable safety profiles are yet available. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) synthesizes and transfers ADP ribose polymers to target proteins, and regulates DNA repair and genomic integrity maintenance. PARP-1 also plays a crucial role in the progression of the inflammatory response, and its inhibition confers protection in several models of inflammatory disorders. We investigated the possible anti-arthritic effects of the PARP-1 inhibitor 5-aminoisoquinolinone (5-AIQ) in a mouse model of adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA). In this study, we examined the effects of 5-AIQ on the key mediators of arthritic inflammation, namely, edema and arthritic score, T cell subsets, regulatory T (Treg) cells, IL-17A, GITR expressing cells, NF-kB p65, IkB-? and pro and anti-inflammatory mediators mRNA expression levels. PARP-1 inhibition 5-AIQ treatment significantly attenuated the severity of AIA, reduced the arthritis scores, a substantial reduction in the levels of T cell subsets, IL-17A, NF-kB p65, GITR expressing cells, and as well as the pro-inflammatory mediators. However, 5-AIQ significantly up-regulated the number of Tregs cells, IkB-? levels and mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory mediators. Our results suggest that treatment with 5-AIQ attenuated AIA in mice might offer a promising alternative/adjunct treatment for RA.
