{"id":21721,"title":"Identification of dermatophyte species using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH).","abstract":"A genomic in situ hybridization (GISH)-based method for dermatophyte identification has been developed. Using specific GISH probes, discrimination between Trichophyton interdigitale, Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum canis has been conducted. Moreover, GISH has been found particularly helpful when proper dermatophyte identification was difficult due to ambiguous PCR-RFLP patterns.
