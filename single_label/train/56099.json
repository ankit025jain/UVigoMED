{"id":56099,"title":"Cryotherapy-induced release of epiretinal membrane associated with retinal vasoproliferative tumor: analysis of 16 cases.","abstract":"To evaluate epiretinal membrane (ERM) response after cryotherapy for retinal vasoproliferative tumors (VPTs).Retrospective interventional case series.Of 16 eyes with VPT and ERM, the tumor was classified as primary in 12 (75%) eyes or secondary in 4 (25%) eyes. The median patient age was 44 years (mean, 43 years; range, 9-70 years). The tumor was located in extramacular zone (n = 16, 100%) and inferotemporal quadrant (n = 12, 75%). The mean tumor base was 6 mm, and thickness was 3 mm. The ERM involved the macula in 12 (75%) eyes and extramacular zone in 4 (25%) eyes, with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in 6 (38%) eyes. Associated features included cystoid macular edema (n = 8, 50%), subretinal fluid (n = 10, 63%), vitreous cells (n = 9, 56%), and vitreous hemorrhage (n = 7, 44%). Single-session cryotherapy (double freeze-thaw) to the VPT was performed in each case. Over mean follow-up of 68 months (median, 54 months; range, 8-252 months), tumor regression was documented in 16 (100%) cases, with ERM release in 10 (63%) cases. After ERM release, the foveal anatomy was normal in 12 (75%) eyes. Final visual acuity improved (n = 5, 31%), remained stable (n = 9, 56%), or worsened (n = 2, 13%). Posttreatment best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 10 (63%) eyes.Cryotherapy is remarkably effective for VPT of 6 mm or less in basal dimension. After cryotherapy, VPT-related ERM spontaneously released in 63% of the cases, without the need for surgical intervention.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752009","annotations":[{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.562893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.558821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.129359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Cystoids","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoids"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2040","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2040"},{"name":"970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/970"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Vermont Public Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_Public_Television"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
