{"id":62558,"title":"Angiotensin 1 - 7 stimulation of platelet recovery.","abstract":"Thrombocytopenia is an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood resulting from either too few platelets being produced or existing platelets being destroyed. Severe thrombocytopenia leads to excessive bleeding and can be the result of numerous medical conditions or a side effect of medications or treatments. Although platelet transfusions are typically administered to correct thrombocytopenia, transfusions represent a temporary and unsustainable solution. As there is a limited supply of platelet units available for transfusion, along with the significant financial cost and risk of infection, investigation to uncover mechanisms that boost platelet production may have important clinical and therapeutic implications. Treatment with angiotensin 1 - 7 (A(1 - 7)) has been shown in a preclinical and clinical evaluations to have a positive effect on platelet recovery.The authors provide an overview of the current treatment options available for platelet recovery and highlight the need for alternatives. Following on, the authors discuss the use of A(1 - 7) as a potential therapeutic option for platelet recovery, including its safety and efficacy.Current evidence provides a good basis for continued research and evaluation of the benefits of A(1 - 7) treatment in stimulating platelet recovery following myelosuppression. A(1 - 7) therapy has the potential to make a significant contribution to healthcare by providing standalone and additive treatments to address unmet medical needs and life-threatening diseases by utilizing the regenerative arm of the renin-angiotensin system.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555825","annotations":[{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.768348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Bone marrow suppression","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.259797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Thrombopoiesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoiesis"},{"name":"Regenerative medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"}]}
