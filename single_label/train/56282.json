{"id":56282,"title":"Willingness to use follow-up eye care services after vision screening in rural areas surrounding Chennai, India.","abstract":"To assess the willingness to utilise follow-up eye care services among participants of community vision screenings in rural villages surrounding Chennai.Vision screening participants aged ?40?years were selected by systematic sampling and were invited to respond to a pretested verbal survey with close-ended questions before undergoing screening.Two hundred and ninety-two people responded. Among the respondents, 50.3% reported experiencing an eye problem, and 53% of these individuals had never had an eye examination. Acceptance rate for eye surgery, medications, and eyeglasses among the respondents was 59.2%, 52.7% and 90.8%, respectively. These acceptances were not associated with sex, age, or employment; medication acceptance was inversely associated with literacy. Surgery acceptance and medication acceptance were associated with area of residence. Presence of another chronic disease was a predictor for surgery acceptance among respondents experiencing eye problems.Maintaining consistent quality of services delivered is crucial for increasing uptake of existing eye care services. Educational interventions may increase eye care service usage by targeting all demographic subgroups of rural populations equally. Additional interventions should be offered to patients without previous exposure to the healthcare system.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24711657","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"India","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.639867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.551891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Eye examination","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_examination"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.267041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Systematic sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_sampling"},{"name":"Chennai","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maintaining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintaining"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Acceptance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"}]}
