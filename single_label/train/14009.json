{"id":14009,"title":"Management and complications of anaesthesia during balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonic stenosis in dogs: 39 cases (2000 to 2012).","abstract":"The aim of this study was to report the management and complications of anaesthesia in dogs undergoing balloon valvuloplasty.A retrospective review of medical records of dogs that were diagnosed with pulmonic stenosis and undergoing balloon valvuloplasty between 2000 and 2012.Thirty-nine cases were identified (28 males and 11 females). Median (range) age and bodyweight was 6 (4 to 48) months and 11·5 (2·0 to 30·3) kg, respectively. The most commonly represented breeds included mixed breed (n?=?7, 17·9%) and English bulldog (n?=?6, 15·3%). Anaesthesia was induced most commonly with intravenous administration of ketamine-diazepam (n?=?8, 20·5%), propofol-diazepam (n?=?8, 20·5%), or propofol-midazolam-lidocaine (n?=?6, 15·4%), and maintained with isoflurane in combination with fentanyl or lidocaine. Anaesthetic and surgery times (mean?±?sd) were 268·5 ±54?minutes and 193·2 ±50?minutes, respectively. The most common intraoperative complications were hypotension (n?=?19, 48·7%), bradycardia (n?=?8, 20·5%) and desaturation (n?=?7, 17·9%). Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in 21 (53·8%) dogs. Death occurred in one (2·6%) dog due to severe hypotension after ballooning followed by cardiac arrest.Successful anaesthesia can be performed in young dogs with pulmonic stenosis undergoing balloon valvuloplasty. Management of anaesthesia requires intense monitoring and immediate treatment of complications. Anaesthetic risk increases during ballooning and may result in?cardiac arrest.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450439","annotations":[{"name":"Bradycardia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Isoflurane","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflurane"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Bulldog","weight":0.741659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pulmonic stenosis","weight":0.428656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonic_stenosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.26904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.265308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pulmonary circulation","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_circulation"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0392565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dog breed","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1932","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
