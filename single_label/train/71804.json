{"id":71804,"title":"Oncological applications of dual-energy computed tomography imaging.","abstract":"Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) imaging is a promising method used in oncology for accurate detection/diagnosis of malignant and benign lesions. Use of dual-energy spectral, weighted average, color-coded map, and virtual unenhanced images provides increased visual detection and easy lesion delineation. Lesion detectability, sensitivity, and conspicuity are significantly improved using DECT. Material characterization and decomposition are promising using DECT. Both anatomical and functional information related to oncology can be provided by DECT using single contrast-enhanced CT.
