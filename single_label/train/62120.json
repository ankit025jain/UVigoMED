{"id":62120,"title":"CSF-1R expression in tumor-associated macrophages is associated with worse prognosis in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic relevance of colony-stimulating 1 receptor (CSF-1R) expression in both Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells and the surrounding cells (non-HRS cells) in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) .Diagnostic tissues from 112 patients with CHL treated with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine were evaluated retrospectively by immunohistochemical analysis for CSF-1R and CD68 and CD163 for tissue-associated macrophages.High numbers (?30%) of non-HRS cells expressing CSF-1R conferred inferior event-free survival and overall survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. High numbers of non-HRS cells expressing CSF-1R were significantly associated with a high number of tumor-associated macrophages as detected by CD163 expression (P < .001). In particular, coexpression of CSF-1R and CD163 was associated with a worse survival outcome than either CSF-1R or CD163 expression alone or no expression.Our data demonstrate that a high number of non-HRS cells expressing CSF-1R are correlated with an increased tumor macrophage content and worse survival.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619759","annotations":[{"name":"Vinblastine","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinblastine"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.861929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Dacarbazine","weight":0.858615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine"},{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.849748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.815717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.725075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.693414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.676511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.61705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.467719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"CD68","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD68"},{"name":"Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_stimulating_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Sikorsky H-19","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_H-19"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
