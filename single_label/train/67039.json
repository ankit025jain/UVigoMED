{"id":67039,"title":"A clinical review on extreme hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer using nonrobotic linear accelerators.","abstract":"Seven phase I-II studies fell within the inclusion criteria. Details on the radiotherapy technique, patient selection, fractionation scheme, exclusion criteria, treatment toxicity, quality-of-life, and tumor control were collected. The studies provide encouraging results of acute and late toxicity, with rare grade 3 events, that seem comparable to robotic SBRT. The biochemical disease-free survival rates look promising, but most patients belong to the low-risk group. The trials are limited by a short follow-up, small number of patients, and different approaches in prescribing dose and defining the acceptable dose heterogeneities. Currently, nonrobotic SBRT regimens should be used in the context of clinical trials.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654695","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.687646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.422917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.401498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.263403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Particle accelerator","weight":0.0199414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
