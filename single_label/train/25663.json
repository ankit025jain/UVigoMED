{"id":25663,"title":"Suprarenal aortic aneurysm closure with an atrial septal defect Amplatzer device.","abstract":"Conventional repair of pararenal aortic aneurysms has been a technically challenging operation, with a significant morbidity rate of 28-35%. Endovascular stent grafting requires satisfactory landing zones for stent graft anchoring. Therefore, pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually contraindicated for this procedure because of difficulties associated with proximal graft fixation. In this case, we attempted to use a new strategy with an implanted atrial septal defect (ASD) Amplatzer device across the neck of the aneurysm. However, one month after this procedure the patient was referred to the hospital due to significant compression of the right inferior vena cava (IVC). Conclusion. In patients with an atrial septal defect and abdominal pain due to an aneurysm, implantation of an Amplatzer device across the aneurysm neck, may be beneficial.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181920","annotations":[{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.722214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.66794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.417797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.382676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.278789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.227283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.0902063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"}]}
