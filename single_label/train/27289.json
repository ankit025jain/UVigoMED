{"id":27289,"title":"Impact of hybrid rooms with image fusion on radiation exposure during endovascular aortic repair.","abstract":"To evaluate exposure to radiation during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) performed with intraoperative guidance by preoperative computed tomographic angiogram fusion.All consecutive patients who underwent standard bifurcated (BIF) or thoracic (THO), and complex fenestrated (FEN) or branched (BR) EVAR were prospectively enrolled. Indirect dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time (FT), and contrast medium volume were recorded. These data were compared with a previously published prospective EVAR cohort of 301 patients and to other literature. Direct DAP and peak skin dose were measured with radiochromic films. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range).From December 2012 to July 2013, 102 patients underwent standard (56.8%) or complex (43.2%) EVAR. The indirect DAP (Gy.cm(2)) was as follows: BIF 12.2 (8.7-19.9); THO 26.0 (11.9-34.9); FEN 43.7 (24.7-57.5); and BR 47.4 (37.2-108.2). The FT (min) was as follows: BIF 10.6 (9.1-14.7); THO 8.9 (6.0-10.5); FEN 30.7 (20.2-40.5); and BR 39.5 (34.8-51.6). The contrast medium volume (mL) was as follows: BIF 59.0 (50.0-75.0); THO 80.0 (50.0-100.0); FEN 105.0 (70.0-136.0); and BR 120.0 (100.0-170.0). When compared with a previous cohort, there was a significant reduction in DAP during BIF, FEN, and BR procedures, and a significant reduction of iodinated contrast volume during FEN and BR procedures. There was also a significant reduction in DAP during BIF procedures when compared with the literature (p < .01). DAP measurement on radiochromic films was strongly correlated with indirect DAP values (r(2) = .93).The exposure of patients and operators to radiation is significantly reduced by routine use of image fusion during standard and complex EVAR.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Cardiovascular
