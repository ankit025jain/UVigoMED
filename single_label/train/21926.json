{"id":21926,"title":"Extensive tricuspid valve repair after endocarditis using CorMatrix extracellular matrix.","abstract":"Surgical repair of tricuspid regurgitation after medical management of infective endocarditis can present a challenging scenario. We present the case of a 53-year-old man in whom a conventional tricuspid valve operation was deemed suboptimal. Instead, we used a commercially available extracellular matrix (ECM) to perform an extensive reconstruction of his tricuspid valve. Follow-up shows dramatic symptomatic resolution and reverse remodeling of his dilated right ventricle.
