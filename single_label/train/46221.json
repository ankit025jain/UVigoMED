{"id":46221,"title":"Angiosarcoma successfully treated with liver transplantation and sirolimus.","abstract":"Malignant liver tumors represent approximately 1% of malignancies in children. HA is a high-grade tumor of endothelial cells that is even more rare in the pediatric population. HA has a limited response to chemotherapy, radiation and resection with universal tumor recurrence with LT and nearly 100% mortality by 18 months. This is the first reported successful case of hepatic angiosarcoma in a child who was treated by LT in combination with sirolimus. Sirolimus antagonizes the mTOR pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, and is being studied as an anti-neoplastic agent for solid tumors.
