{"id":8911,"title":"Effects of virulent and attenuated transmissible gastroenteritis virus on the ability of porcine dendritic cells to sample and present antigen.","abstract":"Virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) results in an acute, severe pathology and high mortality in piglets, while attenuated TGEV only causes moderate clinical reactions. Dendritic cells (DCs), through uptake and presentation of antigens to T cells, initiate distinct immune responses to different infections. In this study, an attenuated TGEV (STC3) and a virulent TGEV (SHXB) were used to determine whether porcine DCs play an important role in pathogenetic differences between these two TGEVs. Our results showed that immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) were susceptible to infection with SHXB and STC3. However, only SHXB inhibited Mo-DCs to activate T-cell proliferation by down-regulating the expression of cell-surface markers and the secretion of cytokines in vitro. In addition, after 48 h of SHXB infection, there was the impairment in the ability of porcine intestinal DCs to sample the antigen, to migrate from the villi to the lamina propria and to activate T-cell proliferation in vivo. In contrast, these abilities of intestinal DCs were enhanced in STC3-infected piglets. In conclusion, our results show that SHXB significantly impaired the functions of Mo-DCs and intestinal DCs in vitro and in vivo, while STC3 had the opposite effect. These differences may underlie the pathogenesis of virulent and attenuated TGEV in piglets, and could help us to develop a better strategy to prevent virulent TGEV infection.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742951","annotations":[{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.959338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antigen presentation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen_presentation"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.702207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.640631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.605003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.542747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.540191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.506688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Intestinal villus","weight":0.50615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.436156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.413409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
