{"id":5020,"title":"Assessing the effectiveness of a healthy homes training.","abstract":"This pilot study assessed the effectiveness of a National Center for Healthy Housing training model on understanding common hazards. An additional objective was to look at local interest in establishing a healthy homes training program in Arkansas. The study involved an intensive 2-day training model with the use of pre- and post-surveys of 69 participants from various invited public health fields. These surveys were administered before and after the training to test for significant change in understanding of healthy home concepts. Proficiency skill level ratings showed significant improvement (all p < 0.0001) in perceived learning across all topic areas. Participants showed post-training improvement in knowledge-based questions in most, but not all topic areas. Study results show improvements are needed in specific training areas addressing skills to keep the home dry and ventilated. The current training model is effective as a potential healthy homes training program; however, some areas of training could be improved and targeted to specific professions.
