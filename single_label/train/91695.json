{"id":91695,"title":"Generation of closed transverse fractures in small animals.","abstract":"The most common procedure that has been developed for use in rats and mice to model fracture healing is described. The nature of the regenerative processes that may be assessed and the types of research questions that may be addressed with this model are briefly outlined. The detailed surgical protocol to generate closed simple transverse fractures is presented, and general considerations when setting up an experiment using this model are described.
