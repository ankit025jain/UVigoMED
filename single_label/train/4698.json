{"id":4698,"title":"Prosthodontic management of maxillectomy patients with dental implants in residual zygomatic bone: a preliminary report.","abstract":"This report describes the 3-year follow-up of clinical and radiographic evaluation of soft and hard tissue outcomes for dental implants placed in residual zygoma in patients with surgical resections. Obturator retention and support, together with a questionnaire evaluation of the patients' satisfaction before and after insertion of implants, also were carried out.A novel approach to the palatomaxillary reconstruction of eight maxillectomy patients (mean age: 40 years) using dental implants inserted into the remaining zygomatic bone on the affected side and left unloaded for 3 months is described. Ball (O-ring) abutments were used with acrylic resin soft tissue conformers after surgical soft tissue thinning above the implants. All patients were radiographically evaluated and clinically documented at regular follow-up appointments.The 3-year follow-up period showed no implant failures, stable peri-implant soft tissue level, and an increase in all of the patients' satisfaction with their implant-supported obturators.Osseointegrated implants in residual zygomas are an integral part of oral rehabilitation strategies, with minimal cost and complications, for maxillectomy patients. This short-term record underscores both the potential of such management interventions and the importance of even longer-term clinical outcome documentation.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25390867","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.721475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.328847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Prosthodontics","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthodontics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.144581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0499999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Zygoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygoma"},{"name":"Acrylic resin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylic_resin"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(neuropsychology)"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Conformational isomerism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformational_isomerism"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
