{"id":85491,"title":"B7-H1 expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma is associated with sarcomatoid histology and poor prognosis.","abstract":"B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1; aka programmed cell death 1 ligand 1) is a negative costimulatory molecule that is associated with poor prognosis in many tumor types. Given the poor prognosis and the limited treatments available for mesothelioma, we decided to examine B7-H1 expression and its association with survival in patients with mesothelioma.Expression of B7-H1 was determined in 106 patients using a mouse monoclonal antihuman B7-H1 (clone 5H1-A3) antibody with immunohistochemistry. Positive expression was defined as ?5% positively stained cells. Clinicopathologic features and survival were compared between B7-H1-positive and B7-H1-negative groups.Malignant mesotheliomas of 42 patients (40%) expressed B7-H1. Patients with B7-H1-postive tumors were less likely to be offered or undergo therapeutic surgery (p = 0.03). All sarcomatoid mesotheliomas except one desmoplastic subtype expressed B7-H1. Survival was significantly decreased for patients whose tumors expressed B7-H1 (5 months median, 2-9.5 months interquartile range) compared with those whose tumors did not (14.5 months, 9.25-19 months; p < 0.0001). In a multivariate model, B7-H1 expression and sarcomatoid mesothelioma remained significantly associated with worse survival (risk ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.03-2.78 [p = 0.04] and risk ratio 2.18, 1.08-4.23 [p = 0.03], respectively).B7-H1 is expressed in a substantial proportion of malignant pleural mesotheliomas and is associated with poor survival. Almost all malignant pleural mesotheliomas with sarcomatoid differentiation expressed B7-H1. The expression of B7-H1 may have important therapeutic implications for the management of malignant pleural mesothelioma.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926549","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.825552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Mesothelioma","weight":0.764021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.722734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.722376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.684582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.533594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.40729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.325366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.287882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.286634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.121201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Desmoplastic fibroma","weight":0.0591798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmoplastic_fibroma"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Pencil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
