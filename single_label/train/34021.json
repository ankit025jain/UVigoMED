{"id":34021,"title":"Impaired cytokine responses in patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS).","abstract":"Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is characterized by dysregulated inflammation with excessive interleukin (IL)-1? activation and secretion. Neonatal-onset multi-system inflammatory disease (NOMID) is the most severe form. We explored cytokine responses in 32 CAPS patients before and after IL-1? blocking therapy. We measured cytokines produced by activated peripheral blood monuclear cells (PBMCs) from treated and untreated CAPS patients after stimulation for 48?h with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), PHA plus IL-12, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS plus interferon (IFN)-?. We measured IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-12p70 and IFN-? in the supernatants. PBMCs from three untreated CAPS patients were cultured in the presence of the IL-1? blocker Anakinra. Fifty healthy individuals served as controls. CAPS patients had high spontaneous production of IL-1?, IL-6, TNF and IFN-? by unstimulated cells. However, stimulation indexes (SIs, ratio of stimulated to unstimulated production) of these cytokines to PHA and LPS were low in NOMID patients compared to controls. Unstimulated IL-10 and IL-12p70 production was normal, but up-regulation after PHA and LPS was also low. LPS plus IFN-? inadequately up-regulated the production of IL-1?, IL-6, TNF and IL-10 in CAPS patients. In-vitro but not in-vivo treatment with Anakinra improved SIs by lowering spontaneous cytokine production. However, in-vitro treatment did not improve the low stimulated cytokine levels. Activating mutations in NLRP3 in CAPS are correlated with poor SIs to PHA, LPS and IFN-?. The impairment in stimulated cytokine responses in spite of IL-1? blocking therapy suggests a broader intrinsic defect in CAPS patients, which is not corrected by targeting IL-1?.
