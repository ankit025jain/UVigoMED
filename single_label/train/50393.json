{"id":50393,"title":"Spectrum and prevalence of nodular thyroid diseases detected by ultrasonography in the Western Black Sea region of Turkey.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate thyroid diseases and the prevalence of goiter by ultrasonography (US) in a moderately iodine deficient area.The MELEN Study is a prospective cohort study on the prevalence of thyroid diseases in Turkish adults. A total of 2233 subjects with a mean age of 50 (age range 18 to 92) were submitted to study. Thyroid US was performed and interpreted by the same experienced physician. Goiter prevalence was defined according to Gutekunst's criteria.The most common thyroid disease was multinodular goiter (MNG) (42%), followed by nodular goiter (NG) (14.6%). The crude prevalence of nodular disease in the region was 56.6%. In the study cohort, thyrotoxicosis (TSH <0.35 ?IU/ml) prevalence was 12 % and subclinical and overt hypothyroidism (TSH > 4.5 ?IU/ml) prevalence was 6.5 %.We found that thyrotoxicosis and nodular thyroidal diseases are more important public health issues in moderate iodine deficient geographical areas. We recommend the increased rates of US screening especially in the endemic regions in order to detect thyroidal nodules earlier.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791840","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.763501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.51528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.378615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.256916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.175453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Black Sea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
