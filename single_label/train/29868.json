{"id":29868,"title":"[Trends of plant toxin food poisonings during the past 50 years in Japan].","abstract":"In the present study, we reviewed food poisoning data published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan from 1961 to 2010 in Japan to analyze the trends of plant toxin food poisonings (PTFPs). The annual number of incidents of PTFPs has gradually increased since 1995. PTFPs were predominantly caused by Datura spp., Veratrum spp. and Aconitum spp. Although PTFPs frequently occurred in April and May, poisonings caused by some plants occurred in all seasons, e.g. Datura spp. The major location of PTFPs was \"at home\", and most of the patients had accidentally harvested poisonous plants. During the past decade, the numbers of incidents of PTFPs caused by Veratrum spp., Narcissus spp., Solanum tuberosum and Alocasia odora were especially increased. Consumer advice to prevent PTFPs associated with certain plants that are cultivated in gardens and contain toxic substances is needed, because PTFPs caused by such plants are increasing. In addition, education of elementary school teachers and children about the potential risks of natural toxins in plants, particularly Solanum tuberosum, is desirable.
