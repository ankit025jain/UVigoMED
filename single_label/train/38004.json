{"id":38004,"title":"The supposed tumor suppressor gene WWOX is mutated in an early lethal microcephaly syndrome with epilepsy, growth retardation and retinal degeneration.","abstract":"WWOX, encoding WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, spans FRA16D, the second most common chromosomal fragile site frequently altered in cancers. It is therefore considered a tumor suppressor gene, but its direct implication in cancerogenesis remains controversial.By whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous WWOX nonsense mutation, p.Arg54*, in a girl from a consanguineous family with a severe syndrome of growth retardation, microcephaly, epileptic seizures, retinopathy and early death, a phenotype highly similar to the abormalities reported in lde/lde rats with a spontaneous functional null mutation of Wwox. As in rats, no tumors were observed in the patient or heterozygous mutation carriers.Our finding, a homozygous loss-of-function germline mutation in WWOX in a patient with a lethal autosomal recessive syndrome, supports an alternative role of WWOX and indicates its importance for human viability.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456803","annotations":[{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Chromosomal fragile site","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_fragile_site"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Germline mutation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.808408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.797641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.79017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.777071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Consanguinity","weight":0.743326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consanguinity"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.59269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.579536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.53857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.528037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.51766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Microcephaly","weight":0.432022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcephaly"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Null allele","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_allele"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.306273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Delayed milestone","weight":0.200516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_milestone"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.111585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Nonsense","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}]}
