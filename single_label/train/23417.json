{"id":23417,"title":"Impact of 2+1 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program in the province of Quebec, Canada.","abstract":"Quebec was the first jurisdiction in the world to recommend a 3-dose (2+1) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) schedule. The program was implemented in December 2004 with a catch-up for children <5 years. PCV-7 was first used and replaced, respectively, by PCV-10 in 2009 and by PCV-13 in 2011.Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) notified to public health authorities and isolates submitted to the provincial reference laboratory during the period 2000-2011 were analyzed.IPD incidence in children <5 years was 67/100,000 in 2001-2004, and decreased to 32/100,000 in 2007-2009 following PCV-7 implementation (p<0.01). A further decrease to 24/100,000 was observed in 2010-2011 following PCV-10 introduction (p<0.01). PCV-7 serotypes represented 82% of the total IPD cases in 2000-2004 and elimination was achieved in 2011. Main emerging serotypes were 19A and 7F. Children exposed to the PCV-10 experienced lower IPD rates and all serotypes contributed to the decline, mainly 7F and 19A. In adults, a decrease of low magnitude was observed in 2005-2006 but rates in 2007-2009 were higher than in the prevaccination period.A 3-dose PCV schedule with high uptake is highly effective and should be recommended worldwide. Serotype replacement eroded benefits especially in adults. PCV-10 introduction had an effect and the impact of PCV-13 use remains to be evaluated.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486346","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Quebec","weight":0.541555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.349856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.274494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Jurisdiction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Hexadecimal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Ketchup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Moment magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Health regions of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_regions_of_Canada"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"British Columbia Highway 19A","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_19A"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_3"}]}
