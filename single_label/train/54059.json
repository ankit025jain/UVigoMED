{"id":54059,"title":"Non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve identification during robotic thyroidectomy.","abstract":"A non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is a rare anomaly in which the nerve enters the larynx directly off the cervical vagus nerve, without descending to the thoracic level. It is very susceptible to damage during surgery. This report describes the important pre-operative radiological evaluations and surgical landmarks in a case of a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve, identified during the recently developed technique of robotic thyroidectomy.A 38-year-old woman presented with suspected papillary microcarcinoma, as indicated by aspiration cytology. Pre-operative computed tomography showed a right aberrant subclavian artery that indicated a possible right non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve. Using robotic thyroidectomy methods, it was possible to carefully dissect along the thyroid capsule. The laryngeal entrance point of the right non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (a constant anatomical landmark) was successfully identified via the three-dimensional, high-magnification views provided by the robotic endoscope.With proper knowledge of radiological and surgical anatomy, and the benefits of high-magnification endoscopic views, a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve can be safely preserved during robotic surgery.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479986","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Vagus nerve","weight":0.84784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.817741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.754445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.665761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.41435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.411377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Laryngeal nerve","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Robotic surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_surgery"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"}]}
