{"id":85759,"title":"The Bandim TBscore--reliability, further development, and evaluation of potential uses.","abstract":"The tuberculosis (TB) case detection rate has stagnated at 60% due to disorganized case finding and insensitivity of sputum smear microscopy. Of the identified TB cases, 4% die while being treated, monitored with tools that insufficiently predict failure/mortality.To explore the TBscore, a recently proposed clinical severity measure for pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, and to refine, validate, and investigate its place in case finding.The TBscore's inter-observer agreement was assessed and compared to the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (paper I). The TBscore's variables underlying constructs were assessed, sorting out unrelated items, proposing a more easily assessable TBscoreII, which was validated internally and externally (paper II). Finally, TBscore and TBscoreII's place in PTB-screening was examined in paper III.The inter-observer variability when grading PTB patients into severity classes was moderate for both TBscore (?W=0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.56) and KPS (?W=0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.65). KPS was influenced by HIV status, whereas TBscore was unaffected by it. In paper II, proposed TBscoreII was validated internally, in Guinea-Bissau, and externally, in Ethiopia. In both settings, a failure to bring down the score by ?25% from baseline to 2 months of treatment predicted subsequent failure (p=0.007). Finally, in paper III, TBscore and TBscoreII were assessed in health-care-seeking adults and found to be higher in PTB-diagnosed patients, 4.9 (95% CI 4.6-5.2) and 3.9 (95% CI 3.8-4.0), respectively, versus patients not diagnosed with PTB, 3.0 (95% CI 2.7-3.2) and 2.4 (95% CI 2.3-2.5), respectively. Had we referred only patients with cough >2 weeks to sputum smear, we would have missed 32.1% of the smear confirmed cases in our cohort. A TBscoreII>=2 missed 8.6%.TBscore and TBscoreII are useful monitoring tools for PTB patients on treatment, as they could fill the void which currently exists in risk grading of patients. They may also have a role in PTB screening; however, this requires our findings to be repeated elsewhere.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857613","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.709192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.381729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.251708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.217813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sputum culture","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum_culture"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Karnofsky score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnofsky_score"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Sorting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
