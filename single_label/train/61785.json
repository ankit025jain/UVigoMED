{"id":61785,"title":"Chromosome 13 deletion and hypodiploidy on conventional cytogenetics are robust prognostic factors in Korean multiple myeloma patients: web-based multicenter registry study.","abstract":"This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities and to identify the specific abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. A total of 2,474 patients whose conventional cytogenetics were available at the time of diagnosis were evaluated via a nationwide registry. Normal metaphase cytogenetics was observed in 2,012 patients (81.3%). Among the 462 patients with chromosomal abnormalities, there were 161 (34.8%) patients with hyperdiploidy, 197 (42.6%) with pseudodiploidy, 79 (17.1%) with hypodiploidy, and 25 (5.5%) with near-tetraploidy. Deletion 13 (?13) in metaphase was observed in 167 patients (6.8%). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out in 967 patients (39.1%), and 66 (13.7%) out of 482 and 63 (10.3%) out of 611 patients were positive for t(4;14) and del(17p), respectively. With a median follow-up duration of 25.1 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 51.2 months (95% confidence interval, 46.5-55.9 months). In univariate analysis, the following four chromosomal abnormalities were significantly associated with a poor survival outcome: ?13, hypodiploidy, del(13q) in FISH, and del(17p) in FISH. In the subsequent multivariate analysis, in which del(13q) and del(17p) in FISH were excluded due to a relatively low number of patients, ?13 and hypodiploid status were independently associated with a poor survival outcome after adjusting for important clinical factors, including age, sex, performance, beta2-microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Using conventional metaphase cytogenetics, we confirmed that both ?13 and hypodiploid status were robust poor prognostic factors. The metaphase karyotyping should remain the primary cytogenetic tool and an essential investigation for risk stratification in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671365","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Metaphase","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.718799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Chromosome 13 (human)","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_13_(human)"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.701037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.674251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.397777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.346916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"}]}
