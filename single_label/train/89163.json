{"id":89163,"title":"Biomechanical comparison of antirotator compression hip screw and cannulated screw fixations in the femoral neck fractures.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of minimal invasive sliding antirotator compressive hip screw (MIS-A-CHS), and multiple cannulated screws (CS) on a Pauwels type 3 femoral neck fracture model.A Pauwels type 3 vertical femoral neck fractures was created on 12 third-generation proximal femur models which were divided into two equal groups. The fracture was fixed with three CS in the first group, and MIS-A-CHS in the second group. The axial and rotational stiffness and maximum compression effect were compared between the groups.The axial and rotational stiffness and maximum compression were significantly higher in MIS-A-CHS group (912.5 N, 540 N and 10.2 N/m, respectively) than the CS group (627.5 N, 380 N, and 3.9 N/m, respectively).MIS-A-CHS appears to be a more secure fixation method in Pauwels type 3 femoral neck fractures than the CS.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747629","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.789004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.47209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.433596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.237111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.219296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0495871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"912","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/912"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Fixation (visual)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(visual)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
