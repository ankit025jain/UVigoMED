{"id":23592,"title":"Ethambutol resistance as determined by broth dilution method correlates better than sequencing results with embB mutations in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates.","abstract":"We evaluated the correlation of phenotypic ethambutol (EMB) susceptibility as determined by two drug susceptibility methods with embB mutations in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. The concordance rate for EMB resistance between broth dilution method and sequencing results (83.6%) was significantly higher than between the proportion method and sequencing results (61.7%) (P = 0.004). Of the embB mutants, 75.4% (46/61) possessed a mutation at embB306. Our results demonstrated that ethambutol resistance determined by broth dilution method reveals better correlation with embB mutations than the proportion method in MDR isolates.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478502","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.826077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.790718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.770151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.462756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Ethambutol","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethambutol"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"306","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/306"},{"name":"Demonic possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
