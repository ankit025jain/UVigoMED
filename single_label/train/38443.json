{"id":38443,"title":"Inhibition of insulin receptor function by a human, allosteric monoclonal antibody: a potential new approach for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.","abstract":"Novel therapies are needed for the treatment of hypoglycemia resulting from both endogenous and exogenous hyperinsulinema. To provide a potential new treatment option, we identified XMetD, an allosteric monoclonal antibody to the insulin receptor (INSR) that was isolated from a human antibody phage display library. To selectively obtain antibodies directed at allosteric sites, panning of the phage display library was conducted using the insulin-INSR complex. Studies indicated that XMetD bound to the INSR with nanomolar affinity. Addition of insulin reduced the affinity of XMetD to the INSR by 3-fold, and XMetD reduced the affinity of the INSR for insulin 3-fold. In addition to inhibiting INSR binding, XMetD also inhibited insulin-induced INSR signaling by 20- to 100-fold. These signaling functions included INSR autophosphorylation, Akt activation and glucose transport. These data indicated that XMetD was an allosteric antagonist of the INSR because, in addition to inhibiting the INSR via modulation of binding affinity, it also inhibited the INSR via modulation of signaling efficacy. Intraperitoneal injection of XMetD at 10 mg/kg twice weekly into normal mice induced insulin resistance. When sustained-release insulin implants were placed into normal mice, they developed fasting hypoglycemia in the range of 50 mg/dl. This hypoglycemia was reversed by XMetD treatment. These studies demonstrate that allosteric monoclonal antibodies, such as XMetD, can antagonize INSR signaling both in vitro and in vivo. They also suggest that this class of allosteric monoclonal antibodies has the potential to treat hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia resulting from conditions such as insulinoma, congenital hyperinsulinism and insulin overdose.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
