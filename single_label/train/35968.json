{"id":35968,"title":"Cardiac arrest in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly without accessory pathways.","abstract":"We describe a case report of a patient with cardiac arrest and Ebstein's anomaly. This case report shows us necessity for arrhythmia evaluation and sudden death risk stratification even in asymptomatic patients. Prophylactic ICD implantation in this patient population is limited to observational studies and the selection of patients is impeded by the absence of randomized trials and weak predictors.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611357","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.766029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.692802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.688124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.422903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.284668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.227159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Accessory (legal term)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_(legal_term)"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Bundle of Kent","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_of_Kent"}]}
