{"id":89039,"title":"[The evidence-based neurointensive care: what's next?].","abstract":"The work is devoted to the analysis of modern trends of process of cognition in neurointensive care. In particular, considered the emergence and development of the method of \"evidence-based medicine\" in the treatment of patients with diseases and injuries of the brain. Demonstrated the positive features of the method. However, the authors are focused on the limitations of evidence-based approach, the main of which are the lack of an individualized treatment plan and the paucity of information obtained from materials of randomized controlled trials. The authors propose to combine the \"evidence\" data and the \"classical style\" of treatment, which involves individual clinical judgment based on knowledge of the pathophysiology and pathomorphology, intelligent use of technology, retrospective analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects of certain methods, creation of a special data bank of \"natural\" course of events, the development of individual prognostic model. The authors believe that the use of standards is more appropriate during acute illness and trauma, and the classic style is better for chronic situation.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761595","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.346584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.297453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.292202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.231144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.189447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0320572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Judgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Bank","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}]}
