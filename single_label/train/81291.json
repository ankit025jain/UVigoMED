{"id":81291,"title":"The effect of single-application fluoride treatment on simulated gastric erosion and erosion-abrasion of enamel in vitro.","abstract":"To compare single-application fluoride formulations on enamel erosion and erosion-abrasion in vitro.Enamel specimens were pretreated with either sodium, tin, titanium, or sodium/calcium fluoride and subjected to either an erosion model or an erosion-abrasion model, after which optical profilometry was used to measure enamel step height loss.For erosion, the titanium fluoride (P < .001) reduced enamel loss, whereas the calcium, tin, and sodium treatments showed no significant effects (P > .05). For erosion-abrasion, the titanium fluoride increased enamel loss in comparison to control (P < .001).Titanium fluoride has differing effects on enamel loss from erosion and erosion-abrasion models.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191883","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.434864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.403213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.357819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Tin","weight":0.120728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.016711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
