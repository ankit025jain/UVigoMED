{"id":89221,"title":"[Analysis of intracranial infection factors after transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea].","abstract":"To analyze the factors of intracranial infection after transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.One hundred and seventy-three patients who accepted transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea were retrospectively analyzed. The intracranial infection factors was analyzed by Logistic regression analysis with SPSS 17.0 software.Postoperative infection was found in 17 cases among 173 patients, the infection rate was 9.83%. The unsuccessful transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (?(2) = 6.89, P = 0.001) , the defective diameter of skull base (?(2) = 9.98, P = 0.001) and medical history of intracranial infection (?(2) = 11.08, P = 0.001) were infection factors after transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (all P < 0.05), while sex, age, the site of defection, the aetiological agent, longer application of antibiotics before or after operation and the use of artificial material had no obvious effect (all P > 0.05).Intracranial infection after transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is affected by many factors, such as the unsuccessful transnasal endoscopic repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, the defective diameter of skull base and medical history of intracranial infection.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742510","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.48207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.273065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.253562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.237679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.204581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Rhinorrhea","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid_rhinorrhoea"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Defection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defection"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Base of skull","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_of_skull"}]}
