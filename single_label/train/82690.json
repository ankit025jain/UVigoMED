{"id":82690,"title":"[Primary synovial sarcoma of the parotid gland].","abstract":"Synovial sarcoma is a malignant soft tissue neoplasm which occurs most of the time in teenagers and young adults. Facial, and especially parotid gland localization, is very uncommon.A 15-year-old male patient, with no prior history, was hospitalized for swelling in the left parotid area noted 5 months before. The mass was painful and there was no facial paralysis. A CT scan revealed a tumoral process of mixed density in the left parotid gland. The thorax and abdominal CT scan was normal. The patient was initially treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. He died, 8 months after this multimodal therapy.Five percent of salivary gland primitive tumors are of mesenchymatous origin, 0.3 to 1.5% of which are sarcomas. The diagnosis of parotid gland synovial sarcoma is confirmed by immune-histochemistry and cytogenetic tests. Surgery combined to radiotherapy seems to be the best treatment.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559860","annotations":[{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.925623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Synovial sarcoma","weight":0.653216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_sarcoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.595056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.39619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.238393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Multimodal therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_therapy"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
