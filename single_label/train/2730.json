{"id":2730,"title":"Evaluation of scleral-fixated intraocular lens position anomalies by anterior segment optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"To measure the positions of scleral-fixated intraocular lenses (IOLs) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to evaluate the influence of the position of scleral-fixated IOL on the quality of vision.Twenty-six eyes of 26 patients were included in the study. The average age was 57.5 (11 to 78) years. Anterior segment images were taken using slit lamp optical coherence tomography (SL-OCT) and were used to evaluate the position of the IOL.The average amounts of tilt and decentration were 2.25° ± 1.93° and 359.28 ± 194.70 µm, respectively. There was a positive and moderate relationship between tilt and astigmatism caused by the position of the IOL (P = 0.030). No relationship was detected between decentration and the astigmatism caused by the position of the IOL (P = 0.285).Scleral-fixated IOL position can be evaluated with SL-OCT, which is a noncontact, noninvasive, reproducible, and reliable method of evaluation. Anterior segment OCT has been shown to provide sensitive measurements but not in all cases. The present study showed that a tilted scleral-fixated IOL behaved like a toric IOL, and the astigmatism caused by the position of the scleral-fixated IOL therefore could increase or decrease total astigmatism.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552171","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.901657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.685794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.441887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Slit lamp","weight":0.438373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit_lamp"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.339323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Incandescent light bulb","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"359","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/359"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tilt (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_(optics)"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
