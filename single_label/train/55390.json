{"id":55390,"title":"Comparison of surgically induced astigmatism following iris-claw PIOL insertion with scleral, limbal, or corneal incisions.","abstract":"To compare surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) based on incision site and evaluate the clinical results and astigmatic stability of iris-claw phakic intraocular lens (Artisan lens; Ophtec BV, Groningen, Netherlands) implantation.Eighty-five eyes of 53 patients with myopia who underwent Artisan lens implantation with a 6.2-mm incision and follow-up of 6 months were retrospectively observed. SIA was assessed using keratometric astigmatism at 6 months postoperatively for the incision sites of the sclera, limbus, and cornea, and the efficacy, safety, predictability, and astigmatic stability were also calculated.SIA obtained using Naeser's polar method (KP[90]SIA) was -0.48 ± 0.35 for scleral incisions, -0.99 ± 0.35 for limbal incisions, and -1.14 ± 0.54 for corneal incisions. Corresponding net astigmatism values, as calculated with KP(90)SIA and KP(135)SIA, were 0.70 ± 0.48 (177°), 1.04 ± 0.37 (175°), and 1.21 ± 0.57 (1°), respectively, with SIA increasing the nearer the incision was to the cornea center. Six months after surgery, the efficacy index was 1.03 and the safety index was 1.08. Ninety-eight percent of patients were within 1.50 diopters of attempted refraction.The values of SIA after Artisan lens insertion showed significant differences among three incision locations, despite the absence of significant differences in preoperative steep corneal axis astigmatism values at the incision locations. It would be applicable for refractive surgery in the aspect of minimizing astigmatism after surgery.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893358","annotations":[{"name":"Sclera","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Refractive surgery","weight":0.795796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.71543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.592151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.591886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.455396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.211334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Groningen (city)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen_(city)"},{"name":"Corneal limbus","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_limbus"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Optical axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_axis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Chemical polarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity"},{"name":"Artisan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Besloten Vennootschap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besloten_Vennootschap"},{"name":"Sia","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sia"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Order of St. Patrick","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St._Patrick"}]}
