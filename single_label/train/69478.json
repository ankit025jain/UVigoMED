{"id":69478,"title":"Lichen sclerosus and the risk of malignant progression: a case series of 159 patients.","abstract":"We analyzed 159 stored specimens of Lichen Sclerosus (LS) collected in the period 1999-2011 from 159 patients, in order to evaluate the histological patterns, clinical outcomes and possible associations with malignancies. The histopathologic analysis revealed 145 cases (males and females) with LS alone, 7 in whom penile LS was associated with spinocellular carcinoma (SCC), and 7 in whom LS was associated with a pseudocarcinomatous-hyperplasia (PCH). Extragenital LS was found in 20% (17/85) of the males and 78% (58/74) of the females. In the cases of SCC, immunohistochemical analyses was performed.The results showed very low positivity to p16INK4A and Ki-67; biomolecular PCR was positive in only two cases, and in both cases the non-oncogenic genotype HPV 100 was detected. No important additional risk factors for malignancies were found (e.g., hormones, infections, other autoimmune diseases).","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442050","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Lichen sclerosus","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_sclerosus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Biomolecule","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1785","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1785"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"CDKN2A","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN2A"}]}
