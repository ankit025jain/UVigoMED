{"id":87302,"title":"Imaging of gunshot injuries in a west Dublin teaching hospital--a ten year review.","abstract":"There has been an increase in gun-related crime in Ireland over the last decade to gangland violence, especially in west Dublin. This places a burden on hospital services not previously encountered. The aim of this study was to examine the demographics of gunshot: injuries presenting to a Dublin teaching hospital, and the impact on radiology over a ten year period. A total of 65 gunshot injuries were seen. Mortality for high velocity wounds was much higher (10/23, 43%) than for low-velocity shotgun injuries (2/34, 6%).","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282967","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.622964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.496646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.382308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.37492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Shotgun","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun"},{"name":"Ballistic trauma","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"},{"name":"Organized crime","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime"},{"name":"Dublin","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"1023","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1023"},{"name":"234","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/234"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Gunshot","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot"}]}
