{"id":69535,"title":"[Correction of erectile dysfunction in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia using daily administration of tadalafil 5 mg against the background of combined drug therapy].","abstract":"The study included 59 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED), inhibited inflammation in the prostate gland and with normal or medically normalized levels of total testosterone. All the patients underwent conservative therapy using dutasteride and tamsulosin, 21 of them (group 2) additionally received tadalafil 5 mg daily. Efficacy of treatment was assessed by self-assessment questionnaire of patients before treatment and 12 weeks after therapy. In group 1 of patients, the dynamics of the erectile function, sexual satisfaction and quality of life for patients was not revealed. In the group 2, improvement in erectile function in an average of 19 points was shown (IIEF-5 questionnaire). According to the AMS questionnaire, improvement in sexual function was demonstrated; in patients with compensated androgen deficiency, however, response to the treatment with tadalafil was less pronounced. According to BSFI score after 3 months of therapy with tadalafil, indicator of overall satisfaction of sexual life improved to 2.4 points (p < 0.002). According to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, anxiety in patients was reduced to the permissible values (p < 0.0002), the level of depression was decreased by almost 2-fold (p < 0.0002). The total IPSS score decreased from 13 to 9 points in average. The inclusion of tadalafil in complex of combined conservative therapy of patients with BPH not only improves sexual function but has a positive effect on symptoms of the disease and the psychological state of the patient.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437241","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Tadalafil","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadalafil"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Dutasteride","weight":0.861929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutasteride"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.824485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Orgasm","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.721393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.585106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.464936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.443346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.380984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Tamsulosin","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsulosin"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.234558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.210637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sexological testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexological_testing"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"5-alpha-reductase deficiency","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-alpha-reductase_deficiency"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
