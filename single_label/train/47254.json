{"id":47254,"title":"New surprises of suppressor of cytokine signalling in liver fibrosis.","abstract":"Liver fibrosis is a progressive condition with serious clinical complications arising from abnormal proliferation and amassing of tough fibrous scar tissue. Macrophages are found in secreting chemokines that recruit fibroblasts and other inflammatory cells, and inflammatory cytokines that activate the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) play an essential event during liver fibrogenesis. The potential of macrophages acts in both pro- and anti-fibrotic capacities followed by related genes of inflammation in coordination with epigenetic modifications in liver fibrogenesis.In this review, we focus on the role of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins in transcriptional regulation at the level of the chromatin structure and the interaction of SOCS with microRNAs during liver fibrosis. Moreover, we will discuss the different signalling pathways that interact with SOCS-regulated HSC activation.Although the exact role of SOCS proteins in liver fibrosis has not been fully elucidated, recognition of SOCS proteins and its regulation by these multiple mechanisms may offer new potential targets of liver fibrosis, and provide new understandings of the development of future therapeutic strategies.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597641","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.748581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatic stellate cell","weight":0.704817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_stellate_cell"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.702896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.696416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.64549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.419691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.351825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.326007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.204278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transcriptional regulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Stellate cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellate_cell"}]}
