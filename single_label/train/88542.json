{"id":88542,"title":"A comparison of primary and delayed wound closure in severe open tibial fractures initially treated with internal fixation and vacuum-assisted wound coverage: a case-controlled study.","abstract":"The ideal timing of wound closure for open tibial fractures is debatable. This study aimed to compare outcomes of primary and delayed wound closure in severe open tibial fractures initially treated with internal fixation and vacuum-assisted wound coverage (VAC). Data of 80 patients with Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA and IIIB open tibial fractures treated with primary internal fixation, VAC, either primary wound closure (PWC) or delayed wound closure (DWC), and external fixation were reviewed retrospectively, and outcomes and complications compared. Patients were divided into three groups, including a PWC group (n = 27), DWC group (n = 22), and a control group (n = 31) that had received external fixation. Among all patients, the median age was 38 years (IRQ 32-47 years), and 67.5% were male. Injuries included 33 Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA and 47 type IIIB. Among injuries, 83% (66/80) were high-energy trauma, 63.8% were contaminated and median injury severity score (ISS) was 14 points. Significant differences were found between groups in fixation methods (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups in rates of deep infection, osteomyelitis, amputation and nonunion at 6 and 12 months (all p > 0.05), although all rates were markedly lower in the PWC group. The outcomes of PWC performed in conjunction with primary internal fixation and VAC for the treatment of Gustilo-Andersen type IIIA and IIIB open tibial fractures are similar to or better than those of DWC with primary internal fixation and VAC.
