{"id":21830,"title":"A comprehensive clinical study about patching after strabismus surgery.","abstract":"Patching of the operative eye is occasionally used in pediatric strabismus surgery. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological and physiologic effects of patching after operation by multifactorial methods.We analyzed the perioperative behaviors of 61 children with strabismus conducted from June 2012 to July 2013 in this prospective longitudinal study. The children were randomized into 2 groups. Patients in the patching group underwent postoperative patching and others received no patching. Main outcome measures included The Faces Pain Scale-Revised score or numerical rating scales score, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) score, crying time, and preoperative and postoperative physiologic parameters.Crying time was significantly longer in the patching group than in the no patching group, but self-report scores showed no difference in the groups. Repeated-measures analysis of variance on ranks revealed that postoperative CHEOPS score was lower in the no patching group than in the patching group, whereas no physiologic parameters were significantly different in the 2 groups.Patching is not necessary for reducing postoperative pain or the risk of infection in children undergoing strabismus surgery.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585423","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.581946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.551017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Eastern Ontario","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ontario"},{"name":"Childrens Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childrens_Hospital"},{"name":"Faces (band)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faces_(band)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Risk of infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_infection"},{"name":"Pain scale","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_scale"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Strabismus surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus_surgery"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Crying","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying"},{"name":"Patching","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patching"}]}
