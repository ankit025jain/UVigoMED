{"id":17577,"title":"Susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci to teicoplanin in Pakistan: the MRSET study.","abstract":"To evaluate the susceptibility pattern of S. aureus and enterococci to teicoplanin using an in vitro method.Between February and November 2011, valid bacteriological samples were collected at three hospitals in three cities in Pakistan and the organism was isolated. Only samples containing S. aureus or enterococci were tested for their sensitivity to teicoplanin and various other standard antimicrobials in therapy, using the disc diffusion testing by the Kirby-Bauer method. SPSS 18 was used for statistical analysis.Of the 401 isolates collected, a majority 293 (59.6%) were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, while 136 (33.9%) were methicillin-resistant S. aureus; and 26 (6.5%) were enterococci. All isolates were sensitive to teicoplanin and vancomycin.Teicoplanin had the same in vitro sensitivity as vancomycin against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci in clinical isolates.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864595","annotations":[{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.796038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.777424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.666938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.401005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.181725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Teicoplanin","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teicoplanin"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Venezuelan coup attempt of 1992","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_coup_attempt_of_1992"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Ontario Highway 401","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Highway_401"}]}
