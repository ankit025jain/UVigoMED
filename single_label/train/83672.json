{"id":83672,"title":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus downregulates transforming growth factor ?2 to promote enhanced stability of capillary-like tube formation.","abstract":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common tumor of AIDS patients worldwide. A key characteristic of KS tumors is extremely high levels of vascular slits and extravasated red blood cells, making neoangiogenesis a key component of the tumor. The main KS tumor cell is the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin that maintains KSHV predominantly in the latent state. In cultured endothelial cells, latent KSHV infection induces angiogenic phenotypes, including longer-term stabilization of capillary-like tube formation in Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix. The present studies show that KSHV infection of endothelial cells strongly downregulates transforming growth factor ?2 (TGF-?2). This downregulation allows the stabilization of capillary-like tube formation during latent infection, as the addition of exogenous TGF-?2 inhibits the KSHV-induced stability of these structures. While two KSHV microRNAs are sufficient to downregulate TGF-?2 in endothelial cells, they are not required during KSHV infection. However, activation of the gp130 cell surface receptor is both necessary and sufficient for downregulation of TGF-?2 in KSHV-infected cells.Kaposi's sarcoma is a highly vascularized, endothelial cell-based tumor supporting large amounts of angiogenesis. There is evidence that KSHV, the etiologic agent of KS, induces aberrant angiogenesis. For example, KSHV induces stabilization of capillary-like tube formation in cultured endothelial cells. A clearer understanding of how KSHV regulates angiogenesis could provide potential therapeutic targets for KS. We found that KSHV downregulates TGF-?2, a cytokine related to TGF-?1 that is known to inhibit angiogenesis. The downregulation of this inhibitor promotes the stability of capillary-like tube formation insofar as adding back TGF-?2 to infected cells blocks KSHV-induced long-term tubule stability. Therefore, KSHV downregulation of TGF-?2 may increase aberrant vascularization in KS tumors through increased capillary formation and thereby aid in KS tumor promotion.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275137","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.892088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Basement membrane","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basement_membrane"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.824645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.763571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","weight":0.726788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposi's_sarcoma-associated_herpesvirus"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.696761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.629661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.62819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.6068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.585087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.563698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.409501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.404271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.288758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"}]}
