{"id":85643,"title":"Bilateral chylothorax following neck dissection: a case report.","abstract":"Chylothorax is an extremely rare but potentially life-threatening complication after radical neck dissection. We report the case of a bilateral chylothorax after total thyroidectomy and cervico-central and cervico-lateral lymphadenectomy for thyroid carcinoma.A 40-year-old European woman underwent total thyroidectomy and neck dissection for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Postoperatively she developed dyspnoea and pleural effusion. A chylothorax was found and the initial conservative therapy was not successful. She had to be operated on again and the thoracic duct was legated.The case presentation reports a very rare complication after total thyroidectomy and neck dissection, but it has to be kept in mind to prevent dangerous complications.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885488","annotations":[{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.854301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Chylothorax","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylothorax"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.442591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.265768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Thoracic duct","weight":0.252778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_duct"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.249672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.219918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.201652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 40","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_40"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
