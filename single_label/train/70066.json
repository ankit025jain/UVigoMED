{"id":70066,"title":"Predicting success in regulatory approval from Phase I results.","abstract":"Drug development in oncology is resource intensive and has a high failure rate. In this exploratory analysis, we aimed to identify the characteristics and outcomes of published Phase I studies associated with future Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.Phase I studies of approved and non-approved anticancer agents between 2000 and 2013 were retrospectively examined. Fisher's exact and chi-squared tests were used to compare the potential predictive measures.Phase I studies of 88 anticancer agents (54 approved and 34 non-approved by the FDA), treating a total of 4,423 subjects, were examined. The median number of patients in Phase I trials of approved and non-approved agents was 44.5 and 32, respectively. A total of 423 subjects (86 reporting studies) had a complete responses, and 342 subjects (80 reporting studies) had a partial responses (PR). A higher number of PR (P < 0.001), PR rate (P = 0.003) and longer PR duration (P = 0.001) were predictive of regulatory success.These preliminary findings indicate that objective responses in Phase I trials may have predictive value for later regulatory approval.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25245822","annotations":[{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.835226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.545988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.48505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.11443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.103079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"423","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/423"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Exploratory data analysis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"}]}
