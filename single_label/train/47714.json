{"id":47714,"title":"Bax protein may influence the invasion of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"To evaluate the expression of Bcl-xL, Bak, and Bax proteins in correlation with particular clinico-histopathological parameters, including tumor invasion front, in patients with colorectal cancer.The expression of these proteins was evaluated with the use of the immunohistochemical method in 50 primary tumors.According to observations, a low expression of Bax and Bak proteins is related to the localization of the tumor in the rectum (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05 respectively), which may explain an increased incidence of colorectal cancer in this area. A positive expression of Bax protein also correlates with the presence of cancer cell infiltration to lymph and blood vessels (P < 0.05), which may suggest the participation of this protein in the early stages of colorectal cancer progression. Moreover, a positive expression of Bcl-xL protein correlated with a positive expression of Bak protein. This may suggest a greater participation of Bcl-xL protein in the inhibition of the proapoptotic Bak protein, but not the Bax protein.Bax protein is probably very significant in the cancerogenesis mechanism in the large intestine.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574804","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.57674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.320705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2_homologous_antagonist_killer"}]}
