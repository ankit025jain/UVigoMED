{"id":69266,"title":"Effects of mesenchymal stem cells transplanted at different time points in a rat remnant kidney model.","abstract":"The optimal time for mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) transplantation remains an unresolved issue. We compared the effects of MSCs on a rat remnant kidney model.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided and treated with a corresponding reagent at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, respectively. A remnant kidney model was established and MSCs were injected into rats. The migration of MSCs was then assessed by using cell-tracking experiments. Renal function and histological analyses were performed 4 weeks after MSC transplantation. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the TGF-?1 and ?-SMA levels.Four weeks after MSC injection, MSCs were found to migrate to the injured kidney. Significant histological damage improvement was observed after the treatment of MSCs at 4 and 8 weeks. The functional benefits of MSC treatment were observed in the 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) + MSC group and the benefits were significantly higher at 4 and 8 weeks than at other time points (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, serum creatinine and urea levels as well as glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury indexes were decreased at 4 and 8 weeks. Compared with the 5/6 Nx + PBS group, TGF-?1 and ?-SMA levels were decreased in the 5/6 Nx + MSC group.These data can be used to optimize the MSC transplantation time point as a therapeutic modality.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457259","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.684821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.62659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.375049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.306296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
