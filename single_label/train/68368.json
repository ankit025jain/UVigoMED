{"id":68368,"title":"The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) following transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).","abstract":"The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) caused by transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).One hundred forty-one patients treated between 2005 and 2008 undergoing 305 consecutive sessions of TACE were enrolled. CIN was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of more than 0.5 mg/dl or more than 25 % from baseline within 3 days after TACE without any other identifiable cause of acute kidney injury.CIN by the present definition was observed after 2.6 % of the TACE sessions. No patient showed clinical signs or symptoms of acute renal failure, or required haemodialysis. None of the patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) developed CIN.The present study suggests that TACE is a relatively safe procedure in terms of the risk of CIN under vigorous periprocedural hydration and that the incidence of CIN is comparable to that of AKI associated with intravenous CM administration.• CIN would be lower for non-coronary arterial intervention than for coronary intervention. • The present study suggests that the CIN rates following TACE are low. • The incidence of CIN is comparable to that after intravenous CM administration.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526284","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.608539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.295655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.276854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.157641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"}]}
