{"id":24520,"title":"[A case of pleural tuberculoma with new pulmonary infiltration during anti-tuberculosis therapy].","abstract":"A 61-year-old woman who had received treatment for tuberculous pleurisy for 2 months visited our outpatient clinic. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed the presence of a lens-shaped pleural mass with pulmonary infiltration, despite the decreased pleural effusion. Two weeks later, chest CT showed an increase in the size of the mass and expansion of the intrapulmonary shadow. Percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation without caseous necrosis or acid-fast bacilli. Sputum culture was negative for acid-fast bacilli. Anti-tuberculosis medication was continued, and the lesions eventually resolved. These lesions were diagnosed as pleural tuberculomas, and the intrapulmonary infiltration was considered to be due to the paradoxical worsening of the patient's condition.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432482","annotations":[{"name":"Pleurisy","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Sputum culture","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum_culture"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Caseous necrosis","weight":0.370076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caseous_necrosis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Secondary bronchus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_bronchus"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Shadow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow"}]}
