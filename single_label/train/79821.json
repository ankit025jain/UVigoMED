{"id":79821,"title":"Hyperreactive Malarious Splenomegaly and AIDS: a case report.","abstract":"Malaria is endemic in the North of Brazil. However, Hyperreactive Malarious Splenomegaly (HMS) has been rarely described. Splenomegaly in HIV/Aids infection has a large differential diagnosis, but malaria is a cause of gross splenomegaly, regardless of the HIV status. In this paper, we report the case of a 50-year-old man, HIV positive, with massive splenomegaly and multiple malaria infections in the past. He fulfilled the criteria for HMS, received a short course of anti-malarial treatment and weekly quimioprofilatic Chloroquine. In 9 months, he had great clinical and laboratorial improvement confirming the HMS, a rare diagnosis in Brazil.
