{"id":18197,"title":"Determinants of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infected women in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.","abstract":"We sought to determine the association between HIV-induced immunosuppression, virologic correlates, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).This is a retrospective cohort study, where HIV infected and uninfected women were studied with VVC being the primary outcome. Ninety-seven HIV-infected and 101 HIV-uninfected women were enrolled between June and December 2011. Cases of VVC were confirmed. HIV RNA load was determined by RT-PCR and CD4 counts were obtained from medical records.Fifty-two of 97 (53.6%) HIV-infected and 38/101 (37.6%) HIV-uninfected women were diagnosed with VVC (P = 0.032). The relative risk for VVC amongst HIV-infected patients was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.04-2 P = 0.024). Cases of VVC increased at CD4+ T cell count below 200?cells/mm(3) (P < 0.0001) and plasma HIV RNA load above 10 000?copies/mL (P < 0.0001). VVC was associated with increased genital shedding of HIV (P = 0.002), and there was a linear correlation between plasma HIV load and genital HIV shedding (r = 0.540; R (2) = 0.292; P < 0.0001). Women on HAART were 4-fold less likely (P = 0.029) to develop VVC.CD4 counts below 200?cells/mm(3) and plasma HIV loads ?10 000?copies/mL were significantly associated with VVC.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812479","annotations":[{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.826664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.658814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.622302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.585548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.583523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.560654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.537634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.534199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.290125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"KwaZulu-Natal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Viral shedding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding"}]}
