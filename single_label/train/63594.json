{"id":63594,"title":"Bosutinib: a review of its use in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia.","abstract":"Bosutinib (Bosulif®) is an orally administered small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases. It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic-, accelerated-, or blast-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy (imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) [USA] or for a small subpopulation of these patients for whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options (EU). In a multinational pivotal trial (n = 547), bosutinib treatment resulted in a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) at 24 weeks in one-third of all treated patients with imatinib-resistant chronic-phase CML who had no previous exposure to any TKIs other than imatinib (primary endpoint), with similar results observed in chronic-phase CML patients who were intolerant of imatinib and naïve to all other TKIs. MCyRs were also seen in more than one-quarter of evaluable patients with chronic-phase CML previously treated with multiple TKIs. Most of the patients with chronic-phase CML achieved a complete hematologic response with bosutinib and some patients with advanced phases of CML achieved an overall hematologic response. Responses were seen irrespective of the type of BCR-ABL mutation at baseline, except T315I. Bosutinib had a manageable tolerability profile in the pivotal trial, with ?21 % of patients with chronic-phase CML discontinuing the treatment because of adverse events. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event but was generally manageable, with only few patients discontinuing the treatment because of diarrhea. Therefore, bosutinib is a useful TKI option for patients with Ph+ CML in second-line or greater settings.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420842","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.793689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Small molecule","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.743618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.689809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.670127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.609114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.482171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Philadelphia","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.238729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Drug intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_intolerance"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"}]}
