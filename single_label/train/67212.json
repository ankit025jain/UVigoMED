{"id":67212,"title":"What is still needed to make focal therapy an accepted segment of standard therapy?","abstract":"Focal therapy is gaining interest and this organ-preserving treatment is heading towards becoming an alternative for the conventional surgery and radiation. The purpose of this review is to determine what evidence is required to make focal therapy a viable option for treatment of localized prostate cancer.There is still a lack of high-level evidence for the different focal treatment modalities. The early-stage focal therapy trials are conducted including a various selection of patients and different pretreatment assessment and follow-up, resulting in incomparable data. Recent literature shows it is paramount to extend the amount of biopsies and to alter the way of taking the biopsies with the template-assisted or image-guided approach. To date, multiparametric MRI is the most effective imaging technique in selecting patients for focal therapy.Focal therapy trials are at the early stage of clinical development, with the majority still being phase I studies. To make focal therapy an accepted segment of standard therapy, it needs to proceed toward phase II and III trials. These trials should be conducted with an effective trial design, which will lead to more comparable oncological, functional and quality of life outcomes. Furthermore, it is essential to improve the localization of tumor foci in order to increase the accuracy of spatial targeting of cancer.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637317","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.567608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.298387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
