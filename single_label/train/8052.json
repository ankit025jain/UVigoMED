{"id":8052,"title":"CXCR3 controls T-cell accumulation in fat inflammation.","abstract":"Obesity associates with increased numbers of inflammatory cells in adipose tissue (AT), including T cells, but the mechanism of T-cell recruitment remains unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) participates in T-cell accumulation in AT of obese mice and thus in the regulation of local inflammation and systemic metabolism.Obese wild-type mice exhibited higher mRNA expression of CXCR3 in periepididymal AT-derived stromal vascular cells compared with lean mice. We evaluated the function of CXCR3 in AT inflammation in vivo using CXCR3-deficient and wild-type control mice that consumed a high-fat diet. Periepididymal AT from obese CXCR3-deficient mice contained fewer T cells than obese controls after 8 and 16 weeks on high-fat diet, as assessed by flow cytometry. Obese CXCR3-deficient mice had greater glucose tolerance than obese controls after 8 weeks, but not after 16 weeks. CXCR3-deficient mice fed high-fat diet had reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted, and anti-inflammatory genes, such as Foxp3, IL-10, and arginase-1 in periepididymal AT, compared with obese controls.These results demonstrate that CXCR3 contributes to T-cell accumulation in periepididymal AT of obese mice. Our results also suggest that CXCR3 regulates the accumulation of distinct subsets of T cells and that the ratio between these functional subsets across time likely modulates local inflammation and systemic metabolism.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812325","annotations":[{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.869753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.8572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.793414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.777963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.761989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.751733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.504713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.416071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.414783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.358977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"CXC chemokine receptors","weight":0.207216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0236065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
