{"id":41638,"title":"Liver retransplant for primary disease recurrence.","abstract":"Liver retransplant is the only treatment for patients with irreversible graft failure. However, given the severe shortage of organs, there is an ethical question of equity in the distribution of this resource. Liver retransplant is more expensive and is associated with lower patient/graft survival rates than equivalent rates after primary transplant. Both primary nonfunction and hepatic artery thrombosis account for nearly all cases of early liver retransplant. Late indications of liver retransplant include chronic rejection, biliary complications, or recurrence of primary disease such as hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Donor data are not available when a patient is listed for liver retransplant; therefore, prognostic factors related to the recipient is a more practical way of making the decision to offer liver retransplant is made. In the Model of End-stage Liver Disease era liver retransplant for \"late\" indications is more complex and selection criteria are more stringent. We review the literature for predictive factors influencing outcome of liver retransplant, especially in those with recurrent disease.
