{"id":68171,"title":"Screening plasma miRNAs as biomarkers for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.","abstract":"Acute kidney injury is a common clinical comorbidity and early diagnosis is crucial for improving prognosis, but there is still no ideal biomarker for early diagnosis.miRNA microarray was used for detecting miRNA in kidney subjected to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury 12 h after reperfusion. Real-time PCR was performed to validate the results of microarray. miRNAs in the ischemia group were twice as high as in the sham group. Kidney-enriched miR-10a, miR-192, and miR-194 were detected in rat plasma to screen potential biomarkers for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Aberrant expressed miRNA in plasma at 12 h were further detected at 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h to observe the changing trend of these miRNAs and were compared to blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine.Thirty-six miRNAs were aberrantly expressed in kidney of rats with renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, among which 15 miRNAs had a 2-fold greater change. Results of real-time PCR were generally in accordance with microarray results. Levels of the 15 miRNAs differentially expressed in injured kidney were not significantly different from those in sham kidney. However, miR-10a, miR-192, and miR-194 were significantly increased in plasma of rats with renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, among which miR-10a was elevated within 1 h after reperfusion, whereas miR-192 and miR-194 were elevated at 6 h after injury. Blood urea nitrogen was increased at 12 h and serum creatinine was increased at 6 h after injury.Plasma miR-10a, miR-192, and miR-194 were potential biomarkers for renal ischemia reperfusion injury in rats, and miR-10a might be the most promising plasma biomarker for renal injury because of its elevation within 1 h after renal injury, as well as renal specificity.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553149","annotations":[{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.776284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.775404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.714664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.692443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.609204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.607482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.450653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.238786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.056955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.030692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"}]}
