{"id":46843,"title":"Changes in vitamin D-related mineral metabolism after induction with anti-tumor necrosis factor-? therapy in Crohn's disease.","abstract":"Preclinical studies suggest that TNF-? suppresses PTH synthesis, inhibits renal 1?-hydroxylase activity, and impairs fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) degradation. The impact of inflammation on vitamin D and mineral metabolism has not been well-characterized in Crohn's disease (CD).The objective of the study was to assess short-term changes in vitamin D-related mineral metabolism in CD after anti-TNF-? induction therapy.Eighty-seven CD participants, aged 5-39 years, were assessed at the initiation of anti-TNF-? therapy and 10 weeks later.Indices of clinical disease activity and serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), calcium, PTH, FGF23, IL-6, and TNF-? were measured at each visit. A multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression analysis was used to examine the correlates of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] concentrations at each visit.After anti-TNF-? therapy, cytokines and inflammatory markers [IL-6, TNF-?, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP)] concentrations decreased (all P < .0001), and PTH and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations increased (median 21 vs 30 pg/mL, P < .0001, and median 41.7 vs 48.1 pg/mL, P = .014, respectively). Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, DBP, and FGF23 did not change. In GEE analyses, higher IL-6, TNF-?, ESR, and CRP were associated with lower PTH concentrations (all P < .001), adjusted for corrected calcium and 25(OH)D levels. Higher PTH was associated with higher 1,25(OH)2D concentrations (P < .001) at each visit, independent of 25(OH)D concentrations. Higher levels of all inflammatory markers were associated with lower 1,25(OH)2D concentrations (all P < .05). However, when PTH was added to these models, the inflammatory markers (with the exception of CRP) were no longer significantly associated with 1,25(OH)2D.Greater inflammation was associated with lower PTH and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations. After anti-TNF-? induction, PTH and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations increased without concomitant changes in 25(OH)D and FGF23, consistent with effects of inflammation on PTH and thereby renal conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System
