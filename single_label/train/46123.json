{"id":46123,"title":"A combination of oral uracil-tegafur plus leucovorin (UFT + LV) is a safe regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy after hepatectomy in patients with colorectal cancer: safety report of the UFT/LV study.","abstract":"The use of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) is controversial because no trial demonstrated its benefit. We conducted the phase III trial to evaluate UFT/leucovorin (LV) for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). The primary endpoint has not been available until 2014, we first report the feasibility and safety data of UFT/LV arm. In this multicenter trial, patients who underwent curative resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive surgery alone or surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with UFT/LV. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. A total of 180 patients were enrolled, 90 were randomly assigned to receive UFT/LV therapy. Eighty two of whom were included in safety analyses. In the UFT/LV group, the completion rate of UFT/LV was 54.9%, the relative dose intensity was 70.8% and grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 12.2% of the patients. Elevated bilirubin levels, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, diarrhea, anorexia were common. Most other adverse events were grade 2 or lower and tolerable. In conclusions, UFT/LV is a safe regimen for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who have undergone resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Further studies are warranted to improve completion rate, but UFT/LV is found to be a promising treatment in this setting.
