{"id":36936,"title":"Immunohistochemical detection of BRAF V600E mutant protein using the VE1 antibody in colorectal carcinoma is highly concordant with molecular testing but requires rigorous antibody optimization.","abstract":"The BRAF V600E mutation occurs in 15% of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and has important genetic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. A monoclonal antibody (VE1) targeting the BRAF V600E mutant protein has become available with variable efficacy in literature reports. We investigated the utility of the VE1 antibody in detecting BRAF V600E mutant protein in two cohorts: (1) a retrospectively accrued series of 103 resected CRCs with (N = 57) and without (N = 46) known BRAF V600E mutation status by PCR and (2) a prospective series of 25 CRCs requiring BRAF analysis during routine screening for Lynch syndrome. All 74 cases with positive BRAF V600E mutation demonstrated cytoplasmic positivity with the VE1 antibody with most tumors (70/74, 95%) demonstrating moderate to strong staining. Of the 54 BRAF V600E-negative cases, 51/54 CRCs (94%) were negative with the VE1 antibody while 3 CRCs (6%) demonstrated weak cytoplasmic staining. The sensitivity and specificity of VE1 was 100% and 94%, respectively. Ten BRAF V600E-mutated CRCs had adjacent precursor lesions including 7 sessile serrated adenomas associated with CRCs with high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H). All 10 precursor adenomas were positive for VE1 staining with the 7 sessile serrated adenomas maintaining preserved MLH1 expression. Our results indicate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a useful surrogate for the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in CRC, although weak staining must be evaluated by BRAF PCR analysis to exclude a false positive result. In addition, the BRAF V600E mutation appears to be an early event before the divergent development into MSS and MSI-H pathways.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529329","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Microsatellite instability","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_instability"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.789851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.723105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.666133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.634572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.548188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.47573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.321708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.218357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"MLH1","weight":0.0379059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLH1"},{"name":"Divergence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence"},{"name":"Surrogate endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_endpoint"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
