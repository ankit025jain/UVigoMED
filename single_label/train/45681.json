{"id":45681,"title":"Laparoscopic transgastric endolumenal cystogastrostomy and pancreatic debridement.","abstract":"Cystogastrostomy is commonly performed for internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts (PP) and concomitant debridement of walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN). While an open approach to cystogastrostomy is well established, an optimal minimally invasive technique continues to evolve. This laparoscopic transgastric endolumenal cystogastrostomy presented here allows for a large cystogastrostomy with complete debridement of necrosis and internal drainage through a minimally invasive approach.We performed a retrospective review of 22 patients with symptomatic PP/WOPN treated with attempted laparoscopic transgastric endolumenal cystogastrostomy (Lap-TEC) and pancreatic debridement. Short- and long-term outcomes were assessed.From November 2006 to March 2013, a total of 22 Lap-TEC/pancreatic debridement procedures were attempted; 15 were completed laparoscopically. The median age of the cohort was 49.5 Â± 12 years (range = 18-71), average body mass index = 29.1 kg/m(2), 77 % had an ASA score ? 3, and 10 were female. Gallstones were the most common etiology (50 %), and median time between initial presentation and surgery was 86 days (range = 0-360). Median operative time and estimated blood loss were 213 min and 100 cc, respectively. Forty-one percent of the patients were admitted to the ICU postoperatively and the average length of stay was 14 days (range = 4-50). Median follow-up was 2 months (range = 0-62.5), with one patient having a procedure-related complication. No other reoperations, late complications, or mortalities occurred. All patients had resolution of their symptoms and fluid collections.This technique of internal drainage via Lap-TEC and pancreatic debridement has been successful in achieving primary drainage and relieving symptoms of PP/WOPN with no mortality and minimal morbidity.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671349","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.750883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.718494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.699044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.696494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.643902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.502722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.339737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"ASA physical status classification system","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_physical_status_classification_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.217888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Pseudocyst","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocyst"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
