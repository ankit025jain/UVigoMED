{"id":89604,"title":"Implant failure caused by non-union of bisphosphonate-associated subtrochanteric femur fracture.","abstract":"Bisphosphonate use has been identified as a contributory factor in atypical subtrochanteric fracture of the femur. These fractures are commonly treated with an intramedullary device. We present a case of implant failure of an intrameduallary device caused by non-union of an atypical subtrochanteric fracture.
