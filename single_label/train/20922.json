{"id":20922,"title":"The transcription factor GATA3 is critical for the development of all IL-7R?-expressing innate lymphoid cells.","abstract":"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are critical in innate immune responses to pathogens and lymphoid organ development. Similar to CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell subsets, ILC subsets positive for interleukin-7 receptor ? (IL-7R?) produce distinct sets of effector cytokines. However, the molecular control of IL-7R?(+) ILC development and maintenance is unclear. Here, we report that GATA3 was indispensable for the development of all IL-7R?(+) ILC subsets and T cells but was not required for the development of classical natural killer cells. Conditionally Gata3-deficient mice had no lymph nodes and were susceptible to Citrobactor rodentium infection. After the ILCs had fully developed, GATA3 remained important for the maintenance and functions of ILC2s. Genome-wide gene expression analyses indicated that GATA3 regulated a similar set of cytokines and receptors in Th2 cells and ILC2s, but not in ILC3s. Thus, GATA3 plays parallel roles in regulating the development and functions of CD4(+) T cells and IL-7R?(+) ILCs.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631153","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.777237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.327191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.240046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Interleukin-7 receptor","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-7_receptor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Organogenesis","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organogenesis"},{"name":"GATA3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA3"},{"name":"GATA transcription factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
