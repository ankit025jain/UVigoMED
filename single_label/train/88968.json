{"id":88968,"title":"[Epidemiology of bone and joint disease - the present and future - . Epidemiology of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture in Japan].","abstract":"Osteoporosis is a major burden on modern society because of its high prevalence and tragic consequences due to fractures. According to population-based epidemiologic studies, number of people with osteoporosis in Japan was estimated to be 13 million in 2005, and only 20% of them were under treatment. Osteoporosis is a highly undertreated disease. Number of hip fractures occurred in Japan in 2007 was approximately 130 thousands which were 2.8-fold greater than those in 1987. This increase can be explained by an increase in the elderly population. Prevalence rate of vertebral fracture was reported to be approximately 30% in women aged 70s and 40% in those aged 80s. Fracture risk assessment in individuals is essential for osteoporosis management. To improve prediction accuracy for major osteoporotic fractures, FRAX(®) model including clinical risk factors was developed. Predicted risk of major osteoporotic fractures for Japanese women by FRAX(®) were not significantly different from observed risk in the Japanese Population-based Osteoporosis (JPOS) Cohort Study, and FRAX(®) model without bone mineral density (BMD) showed a similar validity to FRAX(®) model with BMD. This suggests that FRAX(®) without BMD may be used as a screening tool for people at increased risk of fractures in community. However, FRAX(®) should be improved further in combination with new bone strength indices. Epidemiology should play a great role in developing and evaluating such improvement in fracture risk assessment.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769675","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.558999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.558616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.364378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.226764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.161252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.117542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0703344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0150283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Tragedy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy"},{"name":"Modernity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
