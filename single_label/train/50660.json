{"id":50660,"title":"Personalized pharmacotherapy in diabetes care using clinical pharmacology data of basal insulin analogues.","abstract":"Advancement in technology led to the development of many insulin analogues in the last three decades. These analogues are characterized by various clinical pharmacology properties that can be utilized in clinical practice to tailor insulin therapy for each patient with diabetes, individually. This paper explores the different aspects of clinical pharmacology data on basal insulin analogues that can influence the choice of basal insulin for a personalized pharmacotherapy.
