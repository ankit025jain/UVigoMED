{"id":80657,"title":"miR-146a and miR-155 delineate a MicroRNA fingerprint associated with Toxoplasma persistence in the host brain.","abstract":"microRNAs were recently found to be regulators of the host response to infection by apicomplexan parasites. In this study, we identified two immunomodulatory microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-155, that were coinduced in the brains of mice challenged with Toxoplasma in a strain-specific manner. These microRNAs define a characteristic fingerprint for infection by type II strains, which are the most prevalent cause of human toxoplasmosis in Europe and North America. Using forward genetics, we showed that strain-specific differences in miR-146a modulation were in part mediated by the rhoptry kinase, ROP16. Remarkably, we found that miR-146a deficiency led to better control of parasite burden in the gut and most likely of early parasite dissemination in the brain tissue, resulting in the long-term survival of mice.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582962","annotations":[{"name":"Toxoplasmosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Toxoplasma gondii","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.656705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.572136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Apicomplexa","weight":0.242135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.12836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
