{"id":23335,"title":"Protein kinase C mediates enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7-induced attaching and effacing lesions.","abstract":"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 causes outbreaks of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. E. coli O157:H7 intimately attaches to epithelial cells, effaces microvilli, and recruits F-actin into pedestals to form attaching and effacing lesions. Lipid rafts serve as signal transduction platforms that mediate microbe-host interactions. The aims of this study were to determine if protein kinase C (PKC) is recruited to lipid rafts in response to E. coli O157:H7 infection and what role it plays in attaching and effacing lesion formation. HEp-2 and intestine 407 tissue culture epithelial cells were challenged with E. coli O157:H7, and cell protein extracts were then separated by buoyant density ultracentrifugation to isolate lipid rafts. Immunoblotting for PKC was performed, and localization in lipid rafts was confirmed with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Isoform-specific PKC small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to determine the role of PKC in E. coli O157:H7-induced attaching and effacing lesions. In contrast to uninfected cells, PKC was recruited to lipid rafts in response to E. coli O157:H7. Metabolically active bacteria and cells with intact lipid rafts were necessary for the recruitment of PKC. PKC recruitment was independent of the intimin gene, type III secretion system, and the production of Shiga toxins. Inhibition studies, using myristoylated PKC? pseudosubstrate, revealed that atypical PKC isoforms were activated in response to the pathogen. Pretreating cells with isoform-specific PKC siRNA showed that PKC? plays a role in E. coli O157:H7-induced attaching and effacing lesions. We concluded that lipid rafts mediate atypical PKC signal transduction responses to E. coli O157:H7. These findings contribute further to the understanding of the complex array of microbe-eukaryotic cell interactions that occur in response to infection.
