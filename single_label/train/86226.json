{"id":86226,"title":"?-Hydroxyundec-9-enoic acid induces apoptosis through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress in non-small cell lung cancer cells.","abstract":"?-Hydroxyundec-9-enoic acid (?-HUA), a hydroxyl unsaturated fatty acid derivative, is involved in the antifungal activity of wild rice (Oryza officinalis). Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of ?-HUA on a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. ?-HUA increased apoptosis and induced cleavages of caspase-6, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). ?-HUA treatment significantly induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Suppression of CHOP expression and inhibiting ER stress by 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) significantly attenuated the ?-HUA treatment-induced activation of caspase-6, caspase-9, and PARP, and subsequent apoptotic cell death, indicating a role for ER stress in ?-HUA-induced apoptosis. In addition, cells subjected to ?-HUA exhibited significantly increased quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) inhibited ?-HUA-induced apoptotic cell death and ER stress signals, indicating a role for ROS in ER stress-mediated apoptosis in ?-HUA-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that sequential ROS generation and ER stress activation are critical in ?-HUA treatment-induced apoptosis and that ?-HUA represents a promising candidate for NSCLC treatment.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796672","annotations":[{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.85056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.711347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.580135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.546728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Fight-or-flight response","weight":0.336816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.321248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.309085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polyester","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sodium phenylbutyrate","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_phenylbutyrate"},{"name":"Unsaturated fat","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsaturated_fat"}]}
