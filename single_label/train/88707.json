{"id":88707,"title":"Epidemiology of hospitalized traumatic pelvic fractures and their combined injuries in Taiwan: 2000-2011 National Health Insurance data surveillance.","abstract":"From the viewpoint of prehospital emergency medicine, a greater proportion of pelvic fractures not of a life-threatening status but combined with other injuries need more comprehensive recognition.A 12-year nationwide health database of inpatients was reviewed. All cases diagnosed as pelvic fractures were enrolled. The associated injuries classified into 20 categories were further analyzed.During 2000-2011, the hospitalized incidence of pelvic fractures in Taiwan ranged from 17.17 to 19.42 per 100,000, and an increasing trend with age was observed. The mean case-fatality rate was 1.6% for females and 2.1% for males; male patients with pelvic fractures had a significantly higher risk of death than female patients after adjusting for other covariates. 74.2% of these cases were combined with other injuries. The most common associated injuries in an identified body region were other orthopedic fractures of the lower limbs (21.50%), spine/trunk (20.97%), or upper limbs (18.18%), followed by significant head injuries (17.59%), intra-abdominal injuries (11.00%), and thoracic injuries (7.20%).The incidence of hospitalized pelvic fractures in Taiwan was low and the case-fatality rate was lower than those of other countries. Concurrently, coexistence of major combined injuries with pelvic fractures was easily treated at medical centers.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804258","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.860244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.790443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.769436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.610207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.330914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.273639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.268607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.222917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.165079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.0640295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
