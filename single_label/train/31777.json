{"id":31777,"title":"[Split hand-foot: sonographic detection at 12 weeks].","abstract":"Split hand-foot malformation is a rare disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable expression. Inour case, it was detected early by ultrasound in the twelfth week of gestation. The sonographic findings were bilateral split hands and feet. No other alterations were observed in the rest of the systematic assessment of the foetal anatomy. The pathological findings were consistent with the sonographic diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis by corionic villus sampling was performed and voluntary termination of gestation decided.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102675","annotations":[{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.819649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.745082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Expressivity","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivity"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Split, Croatia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
