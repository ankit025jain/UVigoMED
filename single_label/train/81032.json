{"id":81032,"title":"Specific noninvasive detection of Leishmania donovani in desquamated buccal cell swab samples from human visceral Leishmaniasis-HIV coinfected patients.","abstract":"Diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) coinfection is challenging. Specific diagnosis of VL in HIV-coinfected patients was evaluated by molecular methods in desquamated buccal swab samples, demonstrating 86.3% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity in controls. This test holds significant potential for development as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for VL in HIV-coinfected patients.
