{"id":50225,"title":"Influence of serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, age and gender on depression as measured by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.","abstract":"The AIM of the present study was to explore the level of depression in the respondents using the Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS) and find a correlation with the levels of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO), the age and gender of the participants.2401 subjects aged 20-84 yrs were included, 1344 of them female aged 48.7 +/- 14.4 yrs and 1057 male, aged 46.5 +/- 14.5 yrs (p < 0.001). All participants completed the Zung SDS questionnaire and a depressive score was calculated and interpreted as follows: less than 49 points--no depression, between 50 and 59 points--mild depression, between 60 and 69 points--moderate depression and more than 69 points-- severe depression. Body height and weight were measured and serum TSH and Anti-TPO were determined.SDS was higher in the females (47.6 +/- 9.7 vs. 41.7 +/- 8.6, p < 0.001) and correlated with the subjects' age (Spearman's rho(female) = 0.447, p < 0.001, P(male) = 0.402, p < 0.001). Depression was more prevalent in the females (all p < 0.001) with hypothyroidism than in the euthyroid subjects (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.15-2.80, p < 0.011). The odds ratio for depression was 3.47 (2.64-4.57) for the female gender and the risk of depression increased by 6% (5 - 7) with each added year of age. The anti-TPO, BMI and waist circumference did not influence the regression models.The depressive score was higher in the females and increased with age. Hypothyroidism determined a higher risk of depression in the females.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812919","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.739962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.715993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.659376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.55709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.454832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.220915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"1057","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1057"},{"name":"402","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/402"},{"name":"644","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/644"},{"name":"1344","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1344"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"2080s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2080s"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
