{"id":67270,"title":"Renal perfusion in acute kidney injury with DCE-MRI: deconvolution analysis versus two-compartment filtration model.","abstract":"To investigate the results of different pharmacokinetic models of a quantitative analysis of renal blood flow (RBF) in acute kidney injury using deconvolution analysis and a two-compartment renal filtration model.MRI data of ten male Lewis rats were analyzed retrospectively. Six animals were subjected to unilateral acute kidney injury and underwent perfusion imaging by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Renal blood flow was estimated from regions-of-interest depicting the cortex in the DCE-MRI perfusion maps. The perfusion models were compared by a paired t-test and Bland-Altman plots.No significant difference was found between the two compartment model and the deconvolution analysis (P=0.2807). Differences between healthy and diseased kidney in the AKI model were significant for both methods (P<0.05). A Bland-Altman plot showed no systematic errors, and values were equally distributed around the mean difference between the methods lying within the range of 1.96 standard deviations.Both quantification strategies could detect the kidneys that were impaired by AKI. When just aiming at RBF as a marker, a deconvolution analysis can provide similar values as the 2CFM. If functional parameters beyond RBF like glomerular filtration rate are needed, the 2CFM should be employed.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Male Urogenital
