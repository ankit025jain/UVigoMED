{"id":82897,"title":"JPH203, an L-type amino acid transporter 1-selective compound, induces apoptosis of YD-38 human oral cancer cells.","abstract":"Compared to most normal cells that express L-type amino acid transporter 2, L-type amino acid transporter 1 is highly expressed in cancer cells and presumed to support their elevated growth and proliferation. This study examined JPH203, a potent and selective L-type amino acid transporter 1 inhibitor, and its ability to suppress YD-38 human oral cancer cell growth. The YD-38 cells express L-type amino acid transporter 1 with its associating protein 4F2 heavy chain, but not L-type amino acid transporter 2. JPH203 and BCH, a non-selective L-type amino acid transporter inhibitor, completely inhibited l-leucine uptake in YD-38 cells. As expected, the intrinsic affinity of JPH203 to inhibit l-leucine uptake was far more efficient than BCH. Likewise, JPH203 and BCH inhibited YD-38 cell growth, with JPH203 being superior to BCH. JPH203 up-regulated the population of apoptotic YD-38 cells through the activation of apoptotic factors, including caspases and PARP. These results suggest that the inhibition of L-type amino acid transporter 1 activity via JPH203, which may act as a potential novel anti-oral-cancer agent, leads to apoptosis by inducing the intracellular depletion of the neutral amino acids essential for cancer cell growth in YD-38 human oral cancer cells.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492461","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.616912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.608057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.552618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.538056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.332993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.182231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.146367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Heavy chain","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_chain"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"}]}
