{"id":61500,"title":"Primary pulmonary Hodgkin's lymphoma and a review of the literature since 2006.","abstract":"A 28-year-old woman of Laotian origin presented with dry cough, fevers, night sweats and weight loss over the preceding 6 weeks. Radiological investigations revealed large complex cavitary lesions in the middle and lower lobes of the right lung, with no mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Bronchoscopic investigations did not yield a diagnosis. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration raised the possibility of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Open lung biopsy initially supported this, but eventually a microscopic and immunohistochemical diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma was made. The final diagnosis was primary pulmonary Hodgkin's lymphoma. We present a new case as well as a literature review of reported cases published since 2006.
