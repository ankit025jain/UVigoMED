{"id":54102,"title":"A phase II trial of oxaliplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab as first-line therapy of advanced cancer of the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tube.","abstract":"To determine the safety and efficacy of the novel combination of docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab as first-line treatment of advanced cancer of the ovary, peritoneum or fallopian tube after initial debulking surgery.Eligible patients (stage IB-IV) were treated with 6 cycles of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)), docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks, followed by single-agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks to complete one year of therapy. The primary endpoint was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS).A total of 132 patients (80 with measurable disease at baseline; 52 with non-measurable, evaluable disease at baseline) enrolled and received study treatment. At diagnosis, 76.5% of patients had stage III disease and 20% had stage IV. 62.9% were optimally cytoreduced. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (42.4%), leukopenia (13.6%), hypertension (8.3%), fatigue (6.1%), and nausea (6.1%). One patient (0.8%) had a fatal gastrointestinal perforation. The best overall confirmed response rate (complete response+partial response [measurable disease subgroup]) was 58.6% (95% CI 49%, 67%). CA-125 response rates for the measurable and non-measurable disease subgroups were 83.0% and 81.5%, respectively. The 12-month PFS rate for the measurable disease subgroup was 65.7% (95% CI 53.4%, 76.7%); median PFS was 16.3 (95% CI 12.6, 19.6) months. Median overall survival was 47.3 (95% CI 34.1, upper limit not applicable) months.This novel treatment regimen may provide a promising therapeutic approach for women with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma. No unanticipated safety concerns were identified.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476788","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.840988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.710117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.567135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.548544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.503582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.483971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
