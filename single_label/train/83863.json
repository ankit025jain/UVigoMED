{"id":83863,"title":"Total knee replacement in young, active patients: long-term follow-up and functional outcome: a concise follow-up of a previous report.","abstract":"Concern exists regarding the long-term durability and effectiveness of total knee arthroplasty in young patients. We reviewed our experience with total knee arthroplasty in patients fifty-five years old and younger with severe osteoarthritis to determine the long-term outcomes. One hundred and fourteen total knee arthroplasties were performed in eighty-eight patients at an average patient age of fifty-one years. Clinical outcomes, survival analysis, and radiographs were all reviewed at the most recent follow-up. One hundred and eight knees (eighty-four patients) were followed up from May 2011 to 2012. At thirty years, survivorship without revision for any cause was 70.1% (twenty-five revisions) and survivorship with failure defined as aseptic revision of the tibial or femoral components was 82.5%. At thirty years, a significant difference existed in the survivorship free from tibial or femoral aseptic revision (p = 0.003) between the non-modular Insall-Burstein I component (92.3%) and the modular Insall-Burstein II component (68.3%). All patients were evaluated at an average time from the index total knee arthroplasty to the latest follow-up of 25.1 years (range, twenty to thirty-five years). Clinical evaluation was obtained in thirty-six patients with forty-five total knee arthroplasties. The average Hospital for Special Surgery score had improved from 57.9 points preoperatively to 85.3 points. The average Knee Society score was 87.4 points and the average Knee Society functional score was 62.1 points; the average knee motion was 110°. The mean Tegner and Lysholm activity score improved from 1.5 points preoperatively to 3.0 points. Radiographic review of forty-two knees that had undergone total knee arthroplasty demonstrated a mean 3.2° of valgus, with no cases of radiographically loose components. Total knee arthroplasty with use of a cemented posterior stabilized system, particularly a non-modular Insall-Burstein I design, was an effective treatment option with durable results for end-stage symptomatic osteoarthritis in this young cohort. These data should provide comparison for modern total knee arthroplasties and alternative procedures in young patients.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25232089","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.523601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.34614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.170334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Hospital for Special Surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_for_Special_Surgery"},{"name":"Valgus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Concurrent estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0148293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Concern Worldwide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_Worldwide"}]}
