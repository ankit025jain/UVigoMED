{"id":87508,"title":"Overview of research on the mental health impact of violence in the Middle East in light of the Arab Spring.","abstract":"This is a baseline of published research in the trauma field by Arab researchers. It highlights groundbreaking attempts by Arab researchers to investigate the mental health impact of violence in their countries before the Arab Spring. Peer-reviewed articles (N = 157) were identified through computerized searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Pilots Database, 1995 to 2012. A synopsis of the published research included (a) country, (b) screening instruments, (c) sample size, (d) methods, and (e) results. The findings reveal that domestic violence attracted most attention after civil strife in Palestine and Lebanon. Torture survivors and victims of sexual violence received little attention. Study instruments were borrowed from Western researchers without being validated within local Arab cultures. No clinical outcome studies were found. In light of the Arab Spring, it is urgent that Arab researchers conduct studies that are evidence based and culturally valid addressing the mental health care of all traumatized citizens.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and
