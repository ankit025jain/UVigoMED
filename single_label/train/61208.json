{"id":61208,"title":"Long-term follow-up and second malignancies in 487 patients with hairy cell leukaemia.","abstract":"A large, multicentre, retrospective survey of patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) was conducted in France to determine the frequency of second malignancies and to analyse the long-term effects of the established purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs), cladribine and pentostatin. The survey retrospectively reviewed the medical history of patients and their immediate family, clinical and biological presentation at the time of HCL diagnosis, treatment choice, response to treatment, time to relapse and cause of death. Data were collected for 487 patients with HCL. Of the patients included in the survey, 18% (88/487) had a familial history of cancers, 8% (41/487) presented with malignancies before HCL diagnosis and 10% (48/487) developed second malignancies after HCL was diagnosed. An excess incidence of second malignancies was observed, with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1·86 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1·34-2·51), with no significant difference between PNAs. For second haematological malignancies alone, the SIR was markedly increased at 5·32 (95% CI: 2·90-8·92). This study highlights the high frequency of cancers in HCL patients and their family members. The frequency of second malignancies is notably increased, particularly for haematological malignancies. The respective role of pentostatin and cladribine in the development of second malignancies is debatable.
