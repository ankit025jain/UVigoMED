{"id":72404,"title":"Insertional hypermutation in mineral oil-induced plasmacytomas.","abstract":"Unless stimulated by a chronic inflammatory agent, such as mineral oil, plasma cell tumors are rare in young BALB/c mice. This raises the questions: What do inflammatory tissues provide to promote mutagenesis? And what is the nature of mutagenesis? We determined that mineral oil-induced plasmacytomas produce large amounts of endogenous retroelements--ecotropic and polytropic murine leukemia virus and intracisternal A particles. Therefore, plasmacytoma formation might occur, in part, by de novo insertion of these retroelements, induced or helped by the inflammation. We recovered up to ten de novo insertions in a single plasmacytoma, mostly in genes with common retroviral integration sites. Additional integrations accompany tumor evolution from a solid tumor through several generations in cell culture. The high frequency of de novo integrations into cancer genes suggests that endogenous retroelements are coresponsible for plasmacytoma formation and progression in BALB/c mice.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975032","annotations":[{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrovirus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Plasmacytoma","weight":0.654085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmacytoma"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.531376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Retrotransposon","weight":0.441559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"},{"name":"Somatic hypermutation","weight":0.400653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.374636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Mineral oil","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_oil"},{"name":"Murine leukemia virus","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murine_leukemia_virus"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Pre-integration complex","weight":0.127428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-integration_complex"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.126367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Human T-lymphotropic virus","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_T-lymphotropic_virus"},{"name":"De novo synthesis","weight":0.0988413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_synthesis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
