{"id":73096,"title":"Use of tranexamic acid in infants undergoing choroid plexus papilloma surgery: a report of two cases.","abstract":"Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a highly vascular tumor of infancy. Reducing blood loss is the key to successful surgical removal of CPPs. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is efficacious in reducing bleeding in craniofacial surgery for infants. This report demonstrates the potential utility of TXA for decreasing blood loss in the removal of vascular tumors in infants. We administered tranexamic acid to two infants with CPP during surgical removal to potentially aid hemostasis and therefore lessen intra-operative bleeding. Gross total surgical resection was accomplished; the patients were hemodynamically stable perioperatively, and the total calculated blood loss was minimal at <20% of the patients' total circulating blood volume. This is the first report of tranexamic acid administration for CPP surgery in children. TXA is an easily administered hemostatic agent and may merit further study as an agent to help reduce intra-operative blood loss in this vulnerable population.
