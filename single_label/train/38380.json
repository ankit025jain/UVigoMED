{"id":38380,"title":"A ten-year review of myelodysplastic defect management and use of a novel closure technique with V-Y crescentic rotation advancement flaps.","abstract":"The reconstructive goals for myelodysplastic defects are to provide a multilayered, tension-free and well-vascularized closure to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound infection or breakdown and to optimize neurologic outcomes. We reviewed our ten-year experience with myelodysplastic defects and our preferred technique for large defects utilizing paraspinous flaps followed by V-Y crescentic rotation advancement flaps. A retrospective chart review was performed on all myelodysplastic defects closed at the University of Chicago Medicine from 2002 to 2012. Twenty-three patients were treated: eight were closed using V-Y crescentic rotation advancement flaps, eight primarily, two with transposition flaps and five with bilateral latissimus dorsi and gluteus maximus myocutaneous flaps. Patient defect characteristics, reconstructive details, follow up time, and wound complications were analyzed. The primary closure group included eight patients. There was one minor complication and two major complications that required debridement and plastic surgery consultation in this group. The transposition group included two patients and had no wound healing issues. The latissimus and gluteus myocutaneous group included five patients and had one minor wound healing issues. The V-Y crescentic group included eight patients. There were four minor wound breakdowns in the lateral donor sites and one major wound complication involving a CSF leak, meningitis and wound breakdown that required debridement. The groups were stratified by size, <5 cm and >5 cm, and further analyzed. Bilateral V-Y crescentic rotation advancement flap is a useful option when confronted with large myelodysplastic defects. It provides a multilayer, tension-free wound closure and spares the gluteus maximus and latissimus dorsi muscle groups.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases
