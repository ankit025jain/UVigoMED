{"id":17751,"title":"Fever of unknown origin in a young man.","abstract":"Sphingomonas paucimobilis bacteraemia is a rare infection typically related to nosocomial outbreaks.A 33-year-old immunocompetent man requested evaluation in the Internal Medicine Department for fever without source. His physical examination was normal. Laboratory analysis showed mild hypertransaminasemia. In both blood culture sets grew Gram-negative bacilli, being identified as S. paucimobilis. The patient was treated with oral levofloxacin with full recovery.S. paucimobilis infections can occur in the community setting in a relatively non-immunocompromised patient. In a patient with bacteraemia, microbiological studies are crucial to ensure a successful outcome.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852662","annotations":[{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.837852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.797098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.41342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.368384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Levofloxacin","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.253296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Fever of unknown origin","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever_of_unknown_origin"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
