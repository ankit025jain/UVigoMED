{"id":46583,"title":"MicroRNA-100 regulates SW620 colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting RAP1B.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in tumorigenesis of human cancer. Fewer studies have explored the roles of miR-100 on human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In this study, we utilized real-time PCR to verify whether miR-100 was downregulated in human colorectal cancer tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues. Functional studies demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-100 inhabits cell growth and invasion and induce apoptosis, whereas knockdown of miR-100 yielded the reverse phenotype. Mechanistic studies reveal that miR-100 repressed the activity of a reporter gene fused to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RAP1B, whereas miR-100 silencing upregulated the expression of the reporter gene. Furthermore, we also detected that RAP1B mRNA was inversely expressed with miR-100 in colorectal cancer tissues. These data indicate that the miR-100 plays a tumor suppressor role by regulating colorectal cancer cell growth and invasion phenotype, and could serve as a potential maker for colorectal cancer therapy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626817","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Reporter gene","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter_gene"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.647855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.547214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.481834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.472327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.124282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"RAP1B","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAP1B"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"}]}
