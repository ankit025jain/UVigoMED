{"id":69128,"title":"Penis augmentation by application of silicone material: complications and surgical treatment.","abstract":"Complications resulting from enlargement of the penis by applications of unknown types of silicone and mineral oils are well described. Surgical removal of the tissue altered by inflammation leads to the development of defects of various sizes, often circular from the glans penis to the scrotum. The options of subsequent surgical treatment described in literature are not very extensive. Most defects are managed with skin grafting, rarely V-Y advancement or bilateral scrotal flaps.We present a 36-year-old patient after application of unknown silicone material into the penis for cosmetic enlargement. After the application developed severe inflammation with ulceration and necrosis around the penis. Conservative treatment was not effective, therefore, the infiltrated skin with subcutaneous tissue of the entire penis was surgically removed. The resulting defect was covered by implantation of the penis under the skin of the scrotum.There were no complications in the postoperative course, pain that was present before the surgery immediately subsided. Skin suture healed completely within 14 days. Three months after the surgery the patient returned to normal sexual life.Implantation of the penis under the skin of the scrotum is a fast, safe and effective method that can treat most of the circular skin defects of the penis. Scrotal skin is thin, soft, elastic and creates abundant and good cover around the entire penis.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467680","annotations":[{"name":"Glans penis","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glans_penis"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.826578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.782745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.47494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.438583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.405022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.343527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.323391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.322917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.239629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.0508816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Elastomer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomer"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"}]}
