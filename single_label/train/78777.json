{"id":78777,"title":"[Peculiar features of the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and anticoagulation systems of blood in the patients presenting with vascular ENT tumours].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to study characteristics of the blood coagulation system in the patients presenting with vascular ENT tumours including the following parameters: a complete blood count, hemorrhage, coagulation, retraction, and blood clot lysis times. The patients with ENT hemangiomas experienced hypocoagulation in the preoperative period in combination with the predominance of the fibrinolytic processes and elevated levels of free heparin. These changes can be interpreted as a protective reaction to prevent intravascular coagulation in the case of the slow blood flow in hemangiomatous cavities. The results of the study indicate that the prophylactic administration of inhibitors of enhanced fibrinolysis in the preoperative period may be dangerous for the patients presenting with hemangiomas because suppression of this adaptive response prior to surgery is likely to promote massive microcoagulation under the influence of tissue thromboplastin.
