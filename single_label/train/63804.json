{"id":63804,"title":"Chyluria: is retrograde pyelogram mandatory prior to endoscopic sclerotherapy?","abstract":"Chyluria is the passage of milky urine due to a lymphourinary fistula secondary to lymphatic stasis caused by obstruction of the lymphatic flow. This can be caused by parasitic or non-parasitic infections. Though chyluria is a commonly encountered entity in clinical practice particularly in developing countries like India, it is rarely discussed in English literature. We report a case of chyluria with right bifid ureter in a 50-year-old male patient who was treated with intrarenal pelvic instillation of 1% silver nitrate (AgNO3) and emphasis on the diagnostic implication of retrograde pyelography prior to endoscopic sclerotherapy in managing chyluria particularly in renal anomalies.
