{"id":69466,"title":"A huge malignant solitary fibrous tumor of kidney: case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a spindle cell neoplasm that rarely occurs in the kidney. Malignant SFT of the kidney is particularly rare. Here, we report a 66-year old woman with a right flank mass that has been proved clinically and radiographically. Grossly, the largest diameter of the mass were measured up to 23Â cm, was poorly circumscribed. Approximately 80% of the neoplasm consisted of hyperchromatic and pleomorphic spindled cells surrounding staghornlike blood vessels. Tumor cells frequently had mitoses and necrosis. However, the remainder of the mass was composed of haphazard, storiform or short fascicular arrangements of spindle cells in a loose myxoid to fibrous stroma. Immunohistochemically, we observed diffusely strong CD34 staining and an 85% Ki-67 proliferative index. The tumor partly showed negative CD34 and a 20% proliferative index. To our knowledge, this is the largest malignant renal SFT in the reported literatures and shows an obviously high proliferative index.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1603694556107408.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443842","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.710292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.440332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.279552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Spindle neuron","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.14807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
