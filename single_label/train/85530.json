{"id":85530,"title":"[Traumatic hemothorax treated with transcatheter arterial embolization].","abstract":"A 33-year-old man was transported to our hospital following a traffic accident. He was found to have hemopneumothorax, multiple rib fractures and lung injury by computed tomography(CT). Despite thoracic drainage and fluid resuscitation, he became hemodynamically unstable. At 2 hours after arrival, CT revealed worsening in hemothorax. Emergency angiography of intercostal arteries showed signs of hemorrhage from intercostal arteries, and embolization of the 3?6th intercostal arteries was performed. After transcatheter arterial embolization(TAE), his vital signs got stable and he was discharged without significant complication.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917283","annotations":[{"name":"Hemothorax","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemothorax"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Flail chest","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flail_chest"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Rib fracture","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_fracture"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.513693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hemopneumothorax","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemopneumothorax"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.458029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.398178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.389101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.386487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Intercostal arteries","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_arteries"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
