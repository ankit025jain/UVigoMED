{"id":53703,"title":"Metabolic syndrome: its features in overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome as compared with obese women without ovarian dysfunction?","abstract":"OVARIAN DYSFUNCTIOBJECTIVE: The study assesses the frequency of metabolic changes in overweight patients with or without polycystic ovary syndrome.The study group was made up by 148 patients of whom 99 patients without polycystic ovary syndrome (group A, control group) and 49 with polycystic ovary syndrome (group B), that came in our endocrine unit for a weight loss program, in the September 2008 March 2009 period. Morphometric parameters (height, weight, body mass index), biological parameters (cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin) and body composition analysis by measuring the electrical bioimpedance, were evaluated.Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher percentage of total fat (38.22+/-7.2) than patients without polycystic ovary syndrome (36.316+/-5.65) (p<0.05), for the same characteristics. Glycated hemoglobin, blood glucose and triglycerides were found higher in group B patients. Furthermore, the amount of free testosterone is higher in group B patients compared to those in group A. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in polycystic ovary syndrome cases (26.13%) comparative with overweight cases (16.16%, p<0.01).In the group of overweight patients, the group of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome is a particular group showing more severe metabolic changes.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502037","annotations":[{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.844401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.794576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.774117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.113361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
