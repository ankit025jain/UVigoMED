{"id":70946,"title":"Recent insights into the biology of neuroblastoma.","abstract":"Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system which accounts for 8-10% of pediatric cancers. It is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical behaviors from spontaneous regression to fatal outcome despite aggressive therapies. Considerable progress has been made recently in the germline and somatic genetic characterization of patients and tumors. Indeed, predisposition genes that account for a significant proportion of familial and syndromic cases have been identified and genome-wide association studies have retrieved a number of susceptibility loci. In addition, genome-wide sequencing, copy-number and expression studies have been conducted on tumors and have detected important gene modifications, profiles and signatures that have strong implications for the therapeutic stratification of patients. The identification of major players in NB oncogenesis, including MYCN, ALK, PHOX2B and LIN28B, has enabled the development of new animal models. Our review focuses on these recent advances, on the insights they provide on the mechanisms involved in NB development and their applications for the clinical management of patients.
