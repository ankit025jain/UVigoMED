{"id":74185,"title":"Biological evaluation of 131I- and CF750-labeled Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibodies for xenograft imaging of CD25-positive tumors.","abstract":"A Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody containing the single chain variable fragment of a humanized daclizumab antibody and the Fc fragment of a human IgG1 antibody was produced via recombinant expression in Pichia pastoris. The Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody forms a dimer in solution, and it specifically binds CD25-positive tumor cells and tumor tissues. For tumor imaging, the Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody was labeled with the 131I isotope and CF750 fluorescent dye, respectively. After intravenous injection of mice bearing CD25-positive tumor xenografts, tumor uptake of the (131)I-Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody was visible at 1 h, and clear images were obtained at 5 h using SPECT/CT. After systemic administration of the CF750-Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody, tumor uptake was present as early as 1 h, and tumor xenografts could be kinetically imaged within 9?h after injection. These results indicate that the Dmab(scFv)-Fc antibody rapidly and specifically targets CD25-positive tumor cells, suggesting the potential of this antibody as an imaging agent for the diagnosis of lymphomatous-type ATLL.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864244","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.810962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_T-cell_leukemia/lymphoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.538274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.517501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.431269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Daclizumab","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daclizumab"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Single-chain variable fragment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-chain_variable_fragment"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Enzyme kinetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics"}]}
