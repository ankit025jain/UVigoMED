{"id":43310,"title":"[Serum anti-Ku86: a potential biomarker for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical value of serum anti-Ku86 in early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Expression levels of Ku86 protein in HCC and adjacent normal liver tissues were detected by Western blotting. Serum anti-Ku86 level in 83 patients with early HCC and 124 patients with liver cirrhosis were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Chemiluminescence was used to measure the serum level of ?-fetoprotein (AFP).Expression of Ku86 protein in HCC was increased when compared with the adjacent normal liver tissues (0.21 ± 0.05 vs. 0.08 ± 0.02, P < 0.01). Serum anti-Ku86 level was significantly elevated in HCC patients compared with that in liver cirrhosis patients (0.47 ± 0.22 vs. 0.22 ± 0.06 Abs at 450 nm, P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between HBV infection and HCV infection in HCC patients (0.51 ± 0.19 vs. 0.47 ± 0.24, P = 0.267). Of note, serum anti-Ku86 level was significantly decreased after surgical resection of the tumors in the 30 HCC cases tested (P < 0.01). The results of ROC analysis indicated a better performance of anti-Ku86 (0.857) than AFP (0.739) for early detection of HCC. In 83 HCC patients, the positive rate of anti-Ku86 was 61.4% (51/83), significantly higher than that of the AFP positive rate (27.7%, 23/83). The anti-Ku86 level was positive in 37 of 60 HCC cases with negative AFP. Combination assay of AFP and anti-Ku86 could detect 60 of 83 HCC cases (72.3%, 60/83). There was no significant correlation of anti-Ku86 and AFP (r = 0.156, P = 0.161).Serum anti-Ku86 level is significantly elevated and is not related to HBV and HCV infection in HCC patients. Serum anti-Ku86 antibody may be a potential biomarker for early detection of HCC, and can be used in combination with AFP in clinics.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System
