{"id":89110,"title":"[Analysis on the long-term effects of modified double endobutton technique in the treatment of Tossy type III acromioclavicular joint dislocations].","abstract":"To investigate the long-term clinical effects of modified double Endobutton technique for the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocations of Tossy type III.A retrospective study was done in 42 patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocations of Tossy type III treated with modified double Endobutton technique from December 2008 to December 2010. There were 24 males and 18 females, ranging in age from 21 to 56 years old (averaged, 32.5 years old). All the patients were treated with open reduction, coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction using double Endobutton technique, and repair of acromioclavicular ligament. The Karlsson system was used to evaluate therapeutic effects. The distance from coracoid to clavicle was measured to evaluate reduction loss.All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 2.0 to 3.2 years (averaged,2.4 years). According to Karlsson system, 32 patients got an A degree and 10 patients got a B degree at three months post-operatively; 26 patients got an A degree and 16 patients got a B degree at the latest follow-up; 6 patients got an A degree at 3 months after operation lowered to B degree at the latest follow-up. The coracoid-clavicle distance increased from (26.91 +/- 0.91) mm at 3 months after operation to (27.41 +/- 1.10) mm at the latest follow-up. Te patients treated with over-reduction during operation or with heavy physical labour work after operation had obvious widened coracoid-clavicle distance. Bone absorption was found around the plate in most cases, mainly in the clavicular side.Treatment for acromioclavicular joint dislocations of Tossy type III with modified double Endobutton technique has satisfactory early clinical results. But with time passing, loss of reduction and bone absorption around the plate could be observed, and clinical outcomes of some cases downgrade during the long-term follow-up.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754136","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.265097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Acromioclavicular joint","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_joint"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Coracoclavicular ligament","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoclavicular_ligament"},{"name":"Coracoid","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid"},{"name":"Acromioclavicular ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_ligament"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Downgrade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Karlsson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsson"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Manual labour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_labour"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Tellurium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurium"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"}]}
