{"id":67797,"title":"Structure, not just function.","abstract":"Although kidney size can be important in the evaluation of renal disease, it has not been carefully studied and true volume is rarely measured, and good normative data are lacking. Wang et al. measured both cortical and medullary volumes in potential transplant donors and correlate these with physiologic, morphometric, and metabolic parameters. The results reveal interesting and potentially important correlations and differential responses between the two compartments, providing a framework for future investigation.
