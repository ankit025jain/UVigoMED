{"id":60881,"title":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducible DNA cross-linking agents and their effect on cancer cells and normal lymphocytes.","abstract":"Reducing host toxicity is one of the main challenges of cancer chemotherapy. Many tumor cells contain high levels of ROS that make them distinctively different from normal cells. We report a series of ROS-activated aromatic nitrogen mustards that selectively kill chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) over normal lymphocytes. These agents showed powerful DNA cross-linking abilities when coupled with H2O2, one of the most common ROS in cancer cells, whereas little DNA cross-linking was detected without H2O2. Consistent with chemistry observation, in vitro cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that these agents induced 40-80% apoptosis in primary leukemic lymphocytes isolated from CLL patients but less than 25% cell death to normal lymphocytes from healthy donors. The IC50 for the most potent compound (2) was ~5 ?M in CLL cells, while the IC50 was not achieved in normal lymphocytes. Collectively, these data provide utility and selectivity of these agents that will inspire further and effective applications.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24801734","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.727627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.723099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.700863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.5204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.505451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.447016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.43994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.338048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.317294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.23054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Nitrogen mustard","weight":0.21105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_mustard"},{"name":"Crosslinking of DNA","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosslinking_of_DNA"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.16256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mustard plant","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_plant"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
