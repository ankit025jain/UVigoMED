{"id":41406,"title":"A phase 2 study of filibuvir in combination with pegylated IFN alfa and ribavirin for chronic HCV.","abstract":"Filibuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of filibuvir plus pegylated interferon alfa-2a (pegIFN)/ribavirin.Treatment-na√Øve, HCV genotype-1 patients were randomized to receive filibuvir 300 or 600 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo plus pegIFN (180 ?g/wk) and ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg BID) for 24 weeks. Filibuvir patients who achieved defined response through week 24 discontinued therapy at week 24. All other patients continued on open-label pegIFN/ribavirin through week 48. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) defined as HCV RNA < 15 IU/mL at end of treatment (weeks 24 or 48) and week 72.Overall, 288 patients were randomized and treated. SVR was achieved by 41.7, 39.6, and 45.8% of patients in the filibuvir 300 mg, 600 mg, and placebo arms, respectively. While the addition of filibuvir to pegIFN/ribavirin improved on-treatment virologic response parameters, this did not translate into improved SVR rates due to a high rate of virologic relapse following completion of therapy (300 mg: 35.9%; 600 mg: 42.9%; placebo: 25.4%). The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, fatigue, headache, and insomnia, and were reported at similar rates across arms.Filibuvir plus pegIFN/ribavirin did not improve the percentage of patients achieving SVR compared with administration of pegIFN/ribavirin alone. However, the agent was well tolerated and was associated with higher on-treatment virologic response parameters. Further evaluation of filibuvir in combination with other direct-acting antiviral agents may be considered.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927607","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.728068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.514291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.399078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.328812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.225624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
