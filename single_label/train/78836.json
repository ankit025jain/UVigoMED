{"id":78836,"title":"Hearing threshold levels for a population of 11 to 35 year old Australian females and males.","abstract":"Detailed information on the hearing threshold levels (HTLs) of young Australians was gathered as part of a large-scale study of the relationship between HTL and leisure-noise exposure in young Australians.HTL data for the study population (18-35 year olds) was carefully collected, as well as otoscopy, tympanometry, contra-lateral acoustic reflexes, and otoacoustic emissions (transient and distortion product), together with a comprehensive hearing health history - both past and present.The sample cohort consisted of 1407 individuals, females and males.Prior to analysis, HTL data were filtered according to both a 'Low' and 'High' set of exclusion criteria. The results obtained for both high-screen and low-screen datasets were around +5 dB above the traditionally accepted values of audiometric zero. This is consistent with previous published reports.Comparison with 'ISO 7029 Acoustics: Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age' indicated that threshold values for this dataset have a similar distribution to those of the Standard. This data provides a suitable reference HTL ('normative') database for young Australians.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
