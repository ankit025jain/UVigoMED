{"id":23528,"title":"Sepsis biomarkers: an omics perspective.","abstract":"Sepsis is a common cause of death in hospitalized patients worldwide. The early detection of sepsis remains a great challenge for clinicians, and delayed diagnosis frequently undermines treatment efforts, thereby contributing to high mortality. Omics technologies allow high-throughput screening of sepsis biomarkers. This review describes currently available and novel sepsis biomarkers in the context of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The combination of these technologies can help refine the diagnosis of sepsis. This review paper serves as a reference for future studies that employ an integrated, multi-omics approach to disease identification.
