{"id":29733,"title":"[Wernicke's encephalopathy due to excessive intake of isotonic drink; report of 2 cases].","abstract":"Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurological disease resulting from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. WE is often caused by an unbalanced diet or excessively strict diet therapy in pediatric cases. We experienced 2 cases of WE due to excessive intake of isotonic drink. Patient 1 was a 15-month-old boy. After frequent vomiting, he presented with mental status changes, ocular abnormalities, and truncal ataxia (the classic triad). Patient 2 was a 7-month-old boy. He was hospitalized because of status epilepticus. In both cases, the clinical symptoms improved immediately after the administration of vitamin B1. However, mental retardation was observed as a neurological sequel in patient 2. Because many patients with WE present with vomiting at an early stage, we should take care not to confuse WE with gastroenterocolitis. In addition, it should be noted that some patients with WE present with seizure. Because these 2 cases resulted from an unbalanced diet, it is important to evaluate the patients' eating and drinking habits and advise their parents on proper nutrition. Since many people believe that isotonic drinks are very beneficial and consume them frequently, we should promote awareness that they can be harmful when consumed in excess.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620429","annotations":[{"name":"Status epilepticus","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_epilepticus"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.782814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Mental status examination","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_status_examination"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.590129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.500034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.341803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Altered state of consciousness","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.238635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Heterotroph","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph"}]}
