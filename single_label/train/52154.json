{"id":52154,"title":"Antidiabetic activity of a triterpenoid saponin isolated from Momordica cymbalaria Fenzl.","abstract":"Glucose uptake by isolated diaphragms of both diabetic, following streptozotocin administration, and non-diabetic animals increased in presence of an oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin isolated from the roots of M. cymbalaria. Insulin release was augmented by the presence of the saponin of M. cymbalaria (1 mg/mL) in rat insulinoma cell line (RIN-5F) preexposed to adrenaline (5 microM) and nifedipine (50 microM). Pancreatic histology also indicated considerable quantitative increase in beta-cells (75%) when treated with the saponin. The results suggest that the saponin of M. cymbalaria possesses potential antidiabetic activity with respect to insulin secretion, which may be attributed to modulation of calcium channel, and beta-cell rejuvenation.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624483","annotations":[{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.902289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Insulinoma","weight":0.891514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nifedipine","weight":0.635324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifedipine"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.580956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.490098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Terpene","weight":0.044168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Royal Indian Navy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Indian_Navy"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Eduard Fenzl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Fenzl"},{"name":"Momordica","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momordica"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Rejuvenation (aging)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation_(aging)"}]}
