{"id":16012,"title":"[Retrospective macrorestrictive analysis of the Vibrio cholerae eltor strains isolated at epidemic complications in the Far East of Russia].","abstract":"The retrospective study of the clonal structure of 24 Vibrio cholerae eltor strains isolated at epidemic complications in the Far East of Russia was carried out on the basis of the macrorestrictive analysis of the genome DNA using NotI and SfiI endonucleases. It was found that clonal (by amplification profiling data) toxigenic strains (n = 23) were characterized by variability of NotI/SfiI-generated restriction profiles. The V. cholerae eltor isolated in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk outbreak were differentiated to four pulse-types with one dominating type detected in 76% of the strains. Individual restrictive NotI/SfiI-profile was characteristic for the isolates from Primorye Territory. A non-toxigenic strain formed a separate dendrogram line from the toxigenic strains on the basis of PFGE-pattern structure. Efficiency of macrorestriction analysis application for the profound characteristic of the V. cholerae population structure and ascertainment of molecular-epidemiological regularities of territorial distribution of the separate V. cholerae clones was shown.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080816","annotations":[{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.772605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.285702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.212349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Far East","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East"},{"name":"Primorsky Krai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai"},{"name":"Dendrogram","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Russian Far East","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Far_East"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Endonuclease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonuclease"}]}
