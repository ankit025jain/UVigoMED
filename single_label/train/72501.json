{"id":72501,"title":"The integration of radiosurgery for the treatment of patients with metastatic spine diseases.","abstract":"Significant evidence emerging in the spinal oncology literature recommends radiosurgery as a primary modality of treatment of spinal metastasis. Improvements in the methods of delivering radiation have increased the ability to provide a higher and more exacting dose of radiation to a tumor bed than previously. Using treatment-planning software, radiation is contoured around a specific lesion with the intent of administering a tumoricidal dose. Combined with a minimally invasive, tumor-load reducing surgery, this advanced form of radiation therapy can provide better local control of the tumor compared with conventional external beam radiation.
