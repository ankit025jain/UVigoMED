{"id":54950,"title":"The Prospective Intraoperative and Perioperative Ophthalmic ImagiNg with Optical CoherEncE TomogRaphy (PIONEER) Study: 2-year results.","abstract":"To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and utility of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) for use during ophthalmic surgery.Prospective, consecutive case series.A prospective, single-center, consecutive case series was initiated to assess intraoperative OCT in ophthalmic surgery. Intraoperative scanning was performed with a microscope-mounted spectral-domain OCT system. Disease-specific or procedure-specific imaging protocols (eg, scan type, pattern, size, orientation, density) were used for anterior and posterior segment applications. A surgeon feedback form was recorded as part of the study protocol to answer specific questions regarding intraoperative OCT utility immediately after the surgical procedure was completed.During the first 24 months of the PIONEER study, 531 eyes were enrolled (275 anterior segment cases and 256 posterior segment surgical cases). Intraoperative OCT imaging was obtained in 518 of 531 eyes (98%). Surgeon feedback indicated that intraoperative OCT informed surgical decision making and altered surgeon understanding of underlying tissue configurations in 69 of 144 lamellar keratoplasty cases (48%) and 63 of 146 membrane peeling procedures (43%). The most common anterior segment surgical procedure was Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK, n = 135). Vitrectomy with membrane peeling was the most common procedure for posterior segment surgery (n = 154). The median time that surgery was paused to perform intraoperative OCT was 4.9 minutes per scan session. No adverse events were specifically attributed to intraoperative OCT scanning during the procedure.Intraoperative OCT is feasible for numerous anterior and posterior segment ophthalmic surgical procedures. A microscope-mounted intraoperative OCT system provided efficient imaging during operative procedures. The information gained from intraoperative OCT may impact surgical decision making in a high frequency of both anterior and posterior segment cases.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Eye
