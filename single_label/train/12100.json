{"id":12100,"title":"Antihyperalgesic effects of ginseng total saponins in a rat model of incisional pain.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess whether intraperitoneal administration of ginseng total saponins (GTS) has antihyperalgesic effects in a rat model of incisional pain. The proinflammatory responses and reversal of the antihyperalgesic effect of GTS by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or naloxone were also evaluated.Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.9% saline vehicle or various doses of GTS before or after a plantar incision. Paw withdrawal in response to application of the von Frey filament with the lowest bending force marked the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT). Blood samples were collected for the assessment of serum interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-6 levels. The IL levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with NMDA or naloxone before the GTS injection to assess the reversal of the antihyperalgesic effect of GTS.The MWT measured 2 h after the plantar incision increased significantly after the postincision administration of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg of GTS compared with the MWT at 2 h after plantar incision. The MWT also increased significantly after the preincision injection of 100 or 200 mg/kg of GTS compared with the MWT of the vehicle control. Administration of GTS suppressed the postincision rise in serum IL-1? levels and NMDA inhibited the increase in the MWT compared with GTS alone.Intraperitoneal administration of GTS before or after surgery induces antihyperalgesic effects in a rat model of incisional pain. The effects on mechanical hyperalgesia may be associated with anti-inflammatory cytokines and NMDA signaling.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555878","annotations":[{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Naloxone","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.825046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.66449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.536657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.350897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.159256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Heinrich Frey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Frey"}]}
