{"id":92677,"title":"T/B-cell interactions are more transient in response to weak stimuli in SLE-prone mice.","abstract":"Changes in immune function during the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are well characterized. Class-switched antinuclear antibodies are the hallmark of SLE, and T/B-cell interactions are thus critical. However, changes in immune function contributing to disease susceptibility are unknown. Here, we have analyzed primary T and B cells from a mouse model of SLE prior to the onset of disease. To allow cognate T-cell activation with low affinity, we have developed a lower potency peptide ligand for the OTII TCR. T- and B-cell couples formed less frequently and retained their polarity less efficiently preferentially in response to low-affinity stimulation in SLE-prone mice. This matched decreased recruitment of actin and Vav1 and an enhanced PKC? recruitment to the cellular interface in T cells. The induction of the GC B-cell marker GL7 was increased in T/B cell couples from SLE-prone mice when the T-cell numbers were limited. However, the overall gene expression changes were marginal. Taken together, the enhanced cell-couple transience may allow a more efficient sampling of a large number of T/B cell couples, preferentially in response to limiting stimuli, therefore enhancing the immune reactivity in the development of SLE.
