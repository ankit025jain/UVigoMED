{"id":53303,"title":"Ulcer piercing: cleansing of complicated diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers by positive pressure irrigation.","abstract":"To demonstrate the efficacy of the ulcer piercing procedure, which allows constant cleansing of the ulcer and facilitates a positive pressure irrigation of any pierced hidden tracts, in order to reduce the negative impact of stasis on wound healing.We designed a surgical procedure of ulcer piercing and drainage with a silastic tube, which allows positive pressure irrigation of any pierced tracts. This procedure was performed in a continuous series of 25 selected diabetic patients affected by a Wagner stage 3 ulcer of the toe (n=16), metatarsal midfoot (n=5) and plantar Charcot foot (n=4), and with adequate foot arterial blood supply.Within 6 months of the ulcer piercing procedure, 23/25 of ulcers had completely healed. In two further cases, the ulcer piercing ring was still in place after 3 and 5 months, progressively healing with no active signs of infection.Taking into consideration the advantages and the lack of side effects afforded by this procedure, ulcer piercing represents a small but effective step towards an easier and safer approach to treating complicated diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers with adequate arterial blood supply.There were no external sources of funding for this study. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare with regard to the manuscript or its content.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526081","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.423943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.348835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Body piercing","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Silastic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silastic"},{"name":"Neuropathic arthropathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_arthropathy"},{"name":"Conflict of interest","weight":0.0280949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Richard Wagner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Neural pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"},{"name":"Jean-Martin Charcot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Martin_Charcot"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
