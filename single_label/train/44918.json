{"id":44918,"title":"Soluble E-cadherin as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in gastric carcinoma.","abstract":"Modifications in E-cadherin (E-Cad) expression are associated with dedifferentiation, progression, metastases and poor prognosis in many types of tumors. The aim of the present study was to identify a potential association of the pre- and post-operative soluble E-Cad levels (sE-Cad) with the clinicopathological parameters of patients with gastric cancer.Serum sE-Cad levels were determined in 99 gastric cancer patients and 78 healthy volunteers using ELISA.Levels of sE-Cad were significantly increased in gastric cancer patients compared with these levels in healthy controls (p < 0.001). For the evaluation of the diagnostic significance of sE-Cad the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.835, while the optimal cut-off point of 9.9 microg/mL was determined to classify gastric cancer patients, which yielded sensitivity of 72.7%, specificity of 80.8% and accuracy of 76.3%. Poor differentiation (p = 0.009) and the presence of distant metastases (p < 0.001) were the two significant independent prognostic determinants for high sE-Cad levels in multivariate linear regression analysis. The preoperative levels of sE-Cad also proved helpful in classifying patients according to the choice treatment (curative versus palliative) (AUC, 0.656); when the optimal cut-off point was set at 17.60 microg/mL, the sensitivity was 57%, the specificity was 83% and accuracy was 75%. Survival was shorter in patients with increased sE-Cad (median, 7 months vs 39 months, p = 0.0002), although multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated a marginal prognostic significance of sE-Cad for survival (adjusted HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 0.93 to 3.02, p = 0.072).Serum sE-Cad levels could be considered as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in gastric cancer patients as well as a tool to select a treatment approach. The prognostic value of sE-Cad on overall survival requires further study.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712279","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.649771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.647956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.617981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.562499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.531896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.527014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.499113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.435803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.424648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Statistical classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"}]}
