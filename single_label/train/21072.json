{"id":21072,"title":"[Human rhinovirus diseases--epidemiology, treatment and prevention].","abstract":"Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus Rhinovirus in the family Picornaviridae. They are the most common causative agents of acute diseases of the upper respiratory tract (e. g., common cold), but they also cause acute lower respiratory tract illness, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In addition, human rhinoviruses are known to cause exacerbations of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The treatment of HRV-induced diseases is usually symptomatic and supportiv, a generally recommended antiviral therapy does not exist. For the treatment of the common cold, there are numerous preparations and applications. However, only a few of these agents and measures have been shown to be suitable to reduce the severity of symptoms or to shorten the duration of illness. The risk of acquiring an HRV infection can be reduced by strict adherence to suitable hygiene measures. An effective vaccine is not yet available.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624610","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Viral envelope","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.686882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.676137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Picornavirus","weight":0.612942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picornavirus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.57687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.54541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.271415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.251989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis","weight":0.173761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.173734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"HPV vaccine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
