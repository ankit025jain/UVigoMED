{"id":87363,"title":"[Minimally invasive treatment of tibial plateau fracture under arthroscopy monitoring].","abstract":"Twenty six patients with fracture of tibial plateau was under arthroscopy assisted reduction, the joint surface of bone graft, and USES the steel plate fixation treatment. Average surgery time was 65 min (70-120 min), average fracture healing time was 15 weeks (12-17 weeks), joint surface anatomical reattachment rate was 92.9%. Using break knee function criteria evaluation of curative effect: 18 cases great 6 cases wed, 2 cases ok, fine rate was 92.3%. No infection, deep venous thrombosis and small leg fascia chamber syndrome and other complications. Conclusion is that treatment of tibial plateau fractures under arthroscope has advantages of small trauma, check intuitively and reset accurately, functional recovery of patients are satisfied, the treatment has certain clinical application value.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241526","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.810022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.72565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.620292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.607917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.529067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Steel","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"}]}
