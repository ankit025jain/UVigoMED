{"id":33552,"title":"Aortic arch rerouting and OPCAB in a patient with situs inversus totalis.","abstract":"Endovascular therapy approaches for aortic aneurysm have lowered the mortality and morbidity rates even in high-risk patients; moreover, these approaches are applied in the management of aortic arch pathologies by transposition of the supra-aortic branches. We present the case of a 75-year-old female patient with situs inversus totalis on hemodialysis. The patient underwent off-pump aortic arch rerouting and thoracic endovascular aortic repair concomitant with coronary artery bypass grafting for distal aortic arch aneurysm and ischemic heart disease.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814324","annotations":[{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.841043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.824929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.791023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.771716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.752823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.745098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.636749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
