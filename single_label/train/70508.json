{"id":70508,"title":"Myxopapillary ependymoma of filum terminale.","abstract":"We report a case of 56-year-old patient suffering from myxopapillary ependymoma of filum terminale at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The patient presented with progressive complaints of permanent pain in the anal and sacral region with duration of 8 months. When sneezing or attempting to do brisk movements, the pain irradiated to the posterior surface of the right thigh. Vertebral syndrome was absent. Neurological examination demonstrated no other abnormalities. Magnetic-resonance imaging showed intradural tumor of cauda equina at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The present article discusses the role of MRI in the diagnosis of clinical cases presenting with atypical lumboradiculalgia. We have put an emphasis on the early diagnosis of myxopapillary ependymoma of filum terminale which has an impact on the surgical strategy and postoperative outcome.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181852","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Neurological examination","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_examination"},{"name":"Ependymoma","weight":0.85333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ependymoma"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cauda equina","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauda_equina"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.734816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.641817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.537478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.467958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.464956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.425721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Filum terminale","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filum_terminale"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Spinal tumor","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_tumor"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Sneeze","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze"}]}
