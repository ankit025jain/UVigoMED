{"id":24003,"title":"Lack of association of common polymorphisms in MUC1 gene with H. pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.","abstract":"Several lines of evidence support the notion that MUC1 is often aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer, and it is a ligand for Helicobacter pylori. Genetic variation in MUC1 gene may confer susceptibility to H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. We assessed the association of common polymorphisms in MUC1 gene with H. pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer using an LD-based tag SNP approach in north-western Chinese Han population. A total of four SNPs were successfully genotyped among 288 patients with non-cardia gastric cancer and 281 age- and sex-matched controls. None of the tested SNPs was associated with H. pylori infection. SNP rs9426886 was associated with a decreased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer, but lost significance after adjustment for multiple testing. Overall, our data indicated that common genetic variations in MUC1 gene might not make a major contribution to the risk of H. pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer in our studied population.
