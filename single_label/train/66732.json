{"id":66732,"title":"Lessons learned from the International Renal Cell Carcinoma-Venous Thrombus Consortium (IRCC-VTC).","abstract":"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) extension into the renal vein or the inferior vena cava occurs in 4%-10% of all kidney cancer cases. This entity shows a wide range of different clinical and surgical scenarios, making natural history and oncological outcomes variable and poorly characterized. Infrequency and variability make it necessary to share the experience from different institutions to properly analyze surgical outcomes in this setting. The International Renal Cell Carcinoma-Venous Tumor Thrombus Consortium was created to answer the questions generated by competing results from different retrospective studies in RCC with venous extension on current controversial topics. The aim of this article is to summarize the experience gained from the analysis of the world's largest cohort of patients in this unique setting to date.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682884","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.799044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Renal vein","weight":0.61431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_vein"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.532101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.525251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.194998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"The International (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(film)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Consortium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium"},{"name":"Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lessons_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)"}]}
