{"id":81838,"title":"Clinicopathological evaluation of odontogenic tumours in Pakistan - a seven years retrospective study.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to analyse the clinicopathological spectrum of benign and malignant odontogenic tumours (OT) in Pakistan.This retrospective study was carried out at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Rawalpindi. Seven years archival records of histologically diagnosed odontogenic tumours, both benign and malignant, were collected and the lesions re-diagnosed histologically in accordance with the WHO classification of head and neck tumours (2005). Clinical as well as histological data were analysed and frequency of each type of OT was calculated using computer software programme SPSS (version 17). Mean tumour size was calculated and Chi-square test was applied to find associations of age, gender and site with each histological type of tumour.Only 1.7% of the odontogenic tumours diagnosed in this said period were malignant while the remaining 98.3% were benign. Amongst benign lesions, ameloblastoma was the most common (61.3%) type while primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma (1.7%) was the only reported malignant tumour. Mean age of the affected patients was 31.7Â±16.7 years with posterior mandible as the commonest site involved.Our study revealed ameloblastoma and primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma as the commonest diagnosed benign and malignant tumours respectively. There was a significant difference in age and site of origin of different types of OT at the time of their presentation. However, all the tumours showed male predominance.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815491","annotations":[{"name":"Ameloblastoma","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameloblastoma"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.628301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.412388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.373598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.129769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.118784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Odontogenic","weight":0.0255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"}]}
