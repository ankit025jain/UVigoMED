{"id":35922,"title":"How do I do it: Continuous local anesthetic infusion for children with spinal dysraphism undergoing major reconstruction of the lower urinary tract.","abstract":"Postoperative pain control is a fundamental aspect of contemporary pediatric surgery. While many options for analgesia are available to the general patient population, choices are limited for individuals with spinal dysraphism who undergo major urologic procedures. Continuous infusion of local anesthetics has been shown to improve postoperative pain scores and decreases the need for systemic analgesia. We present our technique for continuous local anesthetic infusion utilizing readily available equipment with limited additional cost.
