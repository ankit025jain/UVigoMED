{"id":86995,"title":"Intralesional injection of Mycobacterium w vaccine vs imiquimod, 5%, cream in patients with anogenital warts: a randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"Intralesional antigen therapy has been used in the treatment of anogenital warts (AGWs), but it has not been compared with existing therapies. Evidence of its efficacy is not strong.To compare the efficacy and safety of intralesional Mycobacterium w (Mw) vaccine with that of imiquimod, 5%, cream in the treatment of AGWs, as well as changes in human papillomavirus (HPV)-6 and HPV-11 viral loads.A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in New Delhi, India, between February 2009 and July 2012 and included a 3-month follow-up. Of 159 patients with AGWs who were screened, 89 were randomized.Patients received either imiquimod, 5%, cream and an intralesional vehicle (imiquimod group: 44 patients) or vehicle cream and intralesional Mw vaccine (Mw group: 45 patients).The primary end point was complete clinical remission of visible AGWs. Secondary measures included the percentage of reduction in the surface area of AGWs and viral load for HPV-6 and HPV-11. Viral load was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.In the intention-to-treat analysis, 59% (n = 26) of the patients in the imiquimod group and 67% (n = 30) of those in the Mw group had complete resolution (P?=?.52). Eighteen HPV genotypes, including high-risk genotypes, were detected, with no significant differences between the treatment groups (all P?>?.05). There was a significant decline in the mean viral loads of HPV-6 (from 0.011?×?108 to 0.00000154?×?108 copies/mg of tissue; P?=?.003) and HPV-11 (from 0.121?×?108 to 0.017?×?108 copies/mg of tissue; P?=?.03) after treatment in the Mw group but only in the viral load of HPV-6 (from 1.41?×?108 to 0.004?×?108 copies/mg of tissue; P?=?.01) in the imiquimod group. There was no recurrence of AGWs in patients with complete clearance at the 3-month follow-up and no serious adverse events.Imiquimod, 5%, and the Mw vaccine were equally effective in achieving clinical and virologic clearance for HPV-6. A significant decline in the HPV-11 viral load was achieved only with the Mw vaccine. Efficacy and safety of intralesional Mw vaccine is comparable to that of imiquimod, 5%, in treatment of AGWs.ctri.nic.in Identifier: CTRI/2009/091/000055.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Virus
