{"id":72649,"title":"Incidence of malignant neoplasia after heart transplantation--a comparison between cyclosporine a and tacrolimus.","abstract":"Heart transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing malignant neoplasms. Administration of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A (CSA) or tacrolimus (TAC) may contribute to this risk.We compared tumor incidence in heart transplant recipients receiving either CSA (n=25) or TAC (n=120) as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Exclusion criteria were therapy with mammalian target of rapamycin-inhibitors, death within the first postoperative year, re-transplantation, and age less than 18 years.The 2 study groups were comparable with respect to sex, primary and concomitant diagnoses, and mean follow-up (60.7 ± 19.3 months in the CSA group vs. 59.8 ± 18.1 months in the TAC group; P=0.81). The CSA group was, however, significantly older compared with the TAC group (58.8 ± 11.4 years vs. 49.1 ± 13.0 years, P=0.001), as was the donor age of the CSA group (43.2 ± 11.2 years vs. 37.0 ± 11.7 years, P=0.02). In the CSA group, 5 patients (20%) developed malignant neoplasms compared with 10 patients (8.3%) in the TAC group (P=0.14). Covariate-adjusted 5-year tumor-free survival was comparable between groups (relative risk for the CSA group =1.162 [95% CI: 0.378-3.572; P=0.794]). Moreover, covariate-adjusted 5-year overall survival did not differ between the 2 groups (relative risk for the CSA group =1.95 [95% CI: 0.53-7.19; P=0.36). The incidence of infection, acute rejection, graft vasculopathy, renal failure, and neurological complications was also comparable between the 2 groups.Our data indicate that tumor incidence does not significantly differ in patients receiving CSA or TAC as maintenance therapy.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953848","annotations":[{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.787718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.406715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.387569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
