{"id":25161,"title":"[Intervention effect of quercetin on inflammatory secretion of cardiac fibroblasts].","abstract":"To establish neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast inflammatory secretion model by using LPS 100 microg x L(-1) combined with ATP 5 mmol x L(-1), in order to study the inhibitory effect of quercetin on the secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 of cardiac fibroblasts, further investigate the effect of quercetin on the protein expression of p-NF-kappaB p65 (S276) and p-Akt (S473) by western blot, and discuss the inhibitory effect of quercetin on the inflammatory secretion of cardiac fibroblasts. According to the findings, quercetin with the concentrations between 51.74 micromol x L(-1) and 827.81 micromol x L(-1) had no significant effect on the activity of cardiac fibroblasts. Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39, 20.70 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the increase of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta induced by LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 36 h (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the increase of IL-6 induced LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 36 h (P < 0.05), without any notable effect of quercetin with the concentration of 20.70 micromol x L(-1). Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39, 20. 70 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the NF-kappaB p65 (S276) activation induced by LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 15 min, with the most significant effect in 20.70 micromol x L(-1). Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39, 20.70 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the increase of p-Akt(473) expression induced by LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 240 min (P < 0.05). Therefore, this study believes that quercetin could attenuate the secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 of cardiac fibroblasts by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB p65 (S276) and Akt (473).","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244766","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.823609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.55743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.309291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.29073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.264226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"NFkappaB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFkappaB"},{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"827","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/827"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_1"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
