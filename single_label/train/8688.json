{"id":8688,"title":"Occurrence and characterization of rotavirus A in broilers, layers, and broiler breeders from Brazilian poultry farms.","abstract":"Rotaviruses are a major cause of diarrhea in humans and animals, including several mammalian and avian species. Using different PCR protocols, we report the occurrence of rotavirus A in 21 (53.84%; 21/39) from 39 fecal pool samples of broilers, layers, and broiler breeders from Brazilian avian farms. We typed the G5, G8, G11, G19, and P[31] genotypes.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758129","annotations":[{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.602344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.584601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.272977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.218376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.172588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"G8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8"},{"name":"Broiler","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Heckler & Koch G11","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_&_Koch_G11"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"List of birds of Belize","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Belize"},{"name":"Poultry farming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Plant breeding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_breeding"}]}
