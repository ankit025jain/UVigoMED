{"id":70456,"title":"Contribution of the pivot nurse in oncology to the experience of receiving a diagnosis of cancer by the patient and their loved ones.","abstract":"The announcement of a cancer diagnosis represents a difficult situation for the patient, their loved ones and professionals (Reich, Vennin & Belkacémie, 2008). Until now, few studies have described nurses' contribution to this critical moment along the care trajectory (Tobin, 2012) and even fewer, the contribution of the pivot nurse in oncology (OPN) or infirmière pivot en oncologie (PNO) as this specialist is called in Quebec. This study aims to document the OPN's contribution to the cancer experience of the patient and their loved ones, from the time the diagnosis is communicated to the period immediately following (four to six weeks). Fourteen PNOs from a Montreal university health centre took part in two individual interviews. Results show that PNOs offer personalized support which draws on their expertise to better understand the experience lived by patients and their loved ones, and adapt their interventions according to their needs and the timing of these interventions. These results support issuing three recommendations for nursing practice in the areas of PNOs; development of expertise, interprofessional collaboration and environment.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189056","annotations":[{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.537669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Quebec","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"},{"name":"University","weight":0.40336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.381855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.337526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.322175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Nazi Germany","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Centrism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nursing practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_practice"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
