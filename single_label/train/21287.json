{"id":21287,"title":"Helicobacter pylori recurrence after first- and second-line eradication therapy in Korea: the problem of recrudescence or reinfection.","abstract":"Recurrence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the result of either recrudescence or reinfection. Annual recurrence rates per patient-year of follow-up have been reported to vary across countries. The aim of this study was to analyze recurrence rates of H. pylori after first-line and second-line eradication therapies in Korea.From 2007 to 2010, 2691 patients with H. pylori infection received first-line therapy and 573 patients who failed to respond to first-line therapy received second-line therapy. H. pylori infection and the success of eradication were assessed by endoscopic biopsy and rapid urease test or (13) C-urea breath test. All patients were advised to undergo (13) C-urea breath test or esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy or rapid urease test 6 months after eradication, with annual follow-up thereafter.The eradication rate of the first-line therapy was 79.9% (1283/1605) and that of the second-line therapy was 90.4% (394/436) by per protocol analysis. Annual recurrence rates sharply declined after 2-year follow-up. Annual recurrence rates within and after 2-year follow-up were 9.3 and 2.0% after first-line therapy and those of second-line therapy were 4.5 and 2.9%, respectively.Annual recurrence rates of H. pylori showed a sharp decline after 2-year follow-up after eradication in Korean adults, which is not higher than that of Western countries. Enough time interval after treatment (i.e., 2 years) is necessary to confirm eradication, and it would not be easy to distinguish between recurrence and recrudescence before 2 years without identifying H. pylori strains.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612156","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.763108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.5738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.534828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.30122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"573","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/573"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Enough","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enough"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Breath test","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_test"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Protocol analysis","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_analysis"}]}
