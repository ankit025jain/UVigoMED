{"id":5509,"title":"[Preventive effects of garlic oil against the benzene-induced hematotoxicity in mice].","abstract":"To investigate the preventive effects of garlic oil (GO) on benzene-induced hematotoxicity in mice.Specific pathogen-free male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, i.e., control group, model group, and low-, middle-, and high-dose GO groups (n = 20 in each group). Mice in GO groups were orally given GO at 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg BW, while mice in the other two groups received an equal volume of corn oil. Two hours later, mice in model group and GO groups were orally given benzene (20%, v/v, dissolved in corn oil, 10 ml/kg BW) for 21 days consecutively. On the 22nd day, blood was collected from the orbital sinus, to determine the counts of red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets (PLT) and hemoglobin level using an automatic blood cell counter. The mice were sacrificed thereafter. The spleen was excised and weighed for calculation of the spleen index (spleen weight/body weight√ó100%).The counts of WBC, RBC, and PLT and Hb level in the model group were reduced by 40%, 18%, 28%, and 23.6%, respectively, as compared with those in the control group (P < 0.01). Compared with those in the model group, WBC and PLT counts in the high-dose GO group increased by 95% and 66%, respectively (P < 0.01), wherein lymphocytes and monocytes increased by 142% and 100%, respectively (P < 0.01); the RBC count and Hb level in the low-dose GO group increased by 15% and 16%, respectively (P < 0.05). GO significantly suppressed benzene-induced decreases in spleen weight and spleen index.GO is capable of suppressing benzene-induced hematotoxicity in mice. One possible mechanism may be promotion of hematopoiesis in the spleen.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169096","annotations":[{"name":"Benzene","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.735843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.719076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Garlic","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Maize","weight":0.541726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.268654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Corn oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_oil"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Biological warfare","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
