{"id":54298,"title":"Benefits of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women.","abstract":"There is growing consensus in the literature that inflammation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and cardiovascular complications. Measuring the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) provides a simple inexpensive method for the assessment of inflammatory status. We investigated the predictive value of pre-procedural (before the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) NLR on the development of GDM in pregnancy.42 women with GDM and 68 women without GDM were included in the study. Complete Blood Count and biochemical tests were followed by a diagnostic 4-point 100-g-OGTT within 2 weeks. GDM was diagnosed by the Carpenter and Coustan criteria. The NLR was calculated from the data.The mean NLR level was significantly higher in GDM women (3.00±0.83 vs. 2.26±0.43 p<0.001, respectively). In ROC analysis, NLR>2.93 had 76.2% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity in predicting GDM. Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated NLR (OR: 5.512, 95% CI: 1.352-22.475, p=0.017) was an independent variable for predicting GDM in pregnancy.An elevated NLR level is a powerful and independent predictor of GDM. The results of this study suggested that inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of GDM.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System
