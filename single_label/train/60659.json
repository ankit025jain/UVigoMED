{"id":60659,"title":"Multiple myeloma: advances reported in 2013 are useful in the clinic.","abstract":"Studies on multiple myeloma reported in 2013 offer support for maintenance after induction and consolidation in newly diagnosed patients eligible for transplantation and for continued lenalidomide in patients not eligible for transplantation. The newest available agents, carfilzomib and pomalidomide, are approved to treat relapsed/refractory myeloma, and in combination they produce impressive response rates and durability. On the horizon, new classes of agents promise even more impressive gains in remission and survival.
