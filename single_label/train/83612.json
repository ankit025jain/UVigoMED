{"id":83612,"title":"Laparoscopy versus laparotomy in the repair of ventral hernias: systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"To compare the laparotomy and laparoscopy techniques for correction of ventral hernia when related to perioperative complications, length of hospitalization, surgical time, and recurrence of hernia.This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, which included studies retrieved from four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and LILACS), using a combination of the terms (Hernia, Ventral) and (Laparoscopy) and (Laparotomy).Six randomized trials were included, totaling 566 patients, 283 in the Laparoscopy group and 283 in the Laparotomy group. Laparoscopy reduced the risk of infection of the surgical wound (NNT = 5) and seroma formation (NNT = 13) and less length hospitalization (P = 0.02) compared to laparotomy in the correction of ventral hernias. Furthermore, laparoscopy increased the incidence of enterotomy (NNH = 25) and post operative pain (NNH = 8) and longer surgical time (P = 0.0009) when compared with laparotomy. There was no difference related to abscess (P = 0.79), hematoma (P = 0.43) and recurrency of ventral hernias (P = 0.25).In the correction of ventral hernias, the use of laparoscopic technique is effective to reduce infections of the surgical wound and seroma formation, as well as, decrease the length hospitalization.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296080","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.82729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.816008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.787992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.72338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Seroma","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.362924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.345077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Number needed to treat","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_treat"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"}]}
