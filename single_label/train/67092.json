{"id":67092,"title":"[Assisted reproductive technologies and ethics].","abstract":"Since the first birth after in vitro fertilization more than 5 million of IVF babies are born in the world. Assisted reproductive technologies captivate the public, they allow maternity without ovary (oocyte donation), without uterus (surrogate mother), paternity without spermatozoids (sperm donation), parentality without limits of age, parentality after death and homoparentality. These technologies arise a lot of ethics questions, the problem is that the answers are not the same all-round the world, laws are based on morals, beliefs, faiths, and convictions. Theses variations arise themselves questions on the value of these non-universal answers.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649561","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.870423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.869774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Egg donation","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Sperm donation","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_donation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.683904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Paternity (law)","weight":0.397409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternity_(law)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Morality","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"}]}
