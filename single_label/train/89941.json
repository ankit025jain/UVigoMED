{"id":89941,"title":"In vivo detection of inhalation injury in large airway using three-dimensional long-range swept-source optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"We report on the feasibility of using long-range swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect airway changes following smoke inhalation in a sheep model. The long-range OCT system (with axial imaging range of 25 mm) and probe are capable of rapidly obtaining a series of high-resolution full cross-sectional images and three-dimensional reconstructions covering 20-cm length of tracheal and bronchial airways with airway diameter up to 25 mm, regardless of the position of the probe within the airway lumen. Measurements of airway thickness were performed at baseline and postinjury to show mucosal thickness changes following smoke inhalation.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664245","annotations":[{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.714275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.492248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.385964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.2695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.228919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.196773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.182246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.061283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Smoke inhalation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_inhalation"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"25 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Space probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"}]}
