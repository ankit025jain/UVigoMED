{"id":61365,"title":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma: current state of anti-CD20 therapy and appraisal of reported response criteria.","abstract":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which is confined to the central nervous system and may also affect intraocular structures. Despite high initial rates of response to methotrexate-based chemotherapy, more than 50% of patients will experience relapse and about 10% have disease that is refractory to chemotherapy. Outcome in patients who fail treatment is very poor, and therefore new therapeutic approaches that may increase the rate of complete response and the proportion of durable remission are sought. Based on the pivotal role that anti-CD20 therapy now plays in the treatment outcome of aggressive systemic B-cell lymphomas, a similar approach is commonly being adapted for PCNSL despite the lack of evidence for its effectiveness. This review examines the current status and level of evidence for the use of monoclonal antibodies against the CD20 surface antigen, which is present on normal and malignant B-cells in PCNSL. The review covers both systemic and local (intracerebrospinal fluid or intravitreal) administration of CD20 monoclonal antibodies in PCNSL. In addition, it scrutinizes the response criteria commonly reported for evaluation of treatment outcome. The importance of differentiating unconfirmed complete response from partial response is outlined and the lack of consensus on response criteria for atypical imaging presentations of PCNSL is delineated.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725453","annotations":[{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.853364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma","weight":0.632693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_central_nervous_system_lymphoma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.290163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.153079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0517203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
