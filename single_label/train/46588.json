{"id":46588,"title":"Oxidative stress and fatty acid profile in Wistar rats subjected to acute food restriction and refeeding with high-fat diets.","abstract":"To assess oxidative stress and the profile of fatty acids incorporated into the hepatic tissue of animals refed with high-fat (HF) diets after acute food restriction.Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups and fasting for 48 hours. One group was sacrificed without refeeding (NR), a control group (C) was refed with the standard AIN-93 diet and the remaining groups with HF diets respectively consisting of hydrogenated vegetable oil (PHVO), trans-free (TF) margarine and trans-free margarine enriched with ?-3 and ?-6 (O). After this period the animals were sacrificed for malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase and hepatic fatty acid determination.The groups refed with HF diets showed elevation of MDA levels compared to the C group (p<0.001 for GVH and p<0.01 for TF and O). Hepatic catalase activity was higher in the TF and O groups compared to group C (p<0.05 for both). The amount of saturated fatty acids was lower in the PHVO and O groups compared to the remaining ones (p<0.001).The consumption of high-fat diets after prolonged fasting favors oxidative imbalance in hepatic tissue.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626730","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.822888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Hydrogenation","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Vegetable fats and oils","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Margarine","weight":0.766946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarine"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.496147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.495686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.491379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.393524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.368031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Hydrogen fluoride","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fluoride"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
