{"id":51403,"title":"Prognostic value of bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with diabetes.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the outcome of patients with type 2 diabetes.This study included 4,329 diabetic patients who underwent PCI. Bleeding was assessed using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria. The primary outcome was one-year mortality. Bleeding events occurred in 474 patients (10.9%). Access-site and non-access-site bleeds occurred in 274 patients (58%) and 200 patients (42%), respectively. Within the first year after PCI there were 198 deaths: 45 deaths (9.6%) among patients with bleeding and 153 deaths (4.0%) among patients without bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio=2.04 [95% confidence interval 1.38-3.00], p<0.001). There were 25 deaths (12.7%) among patients with non-access-site bleeding and 20 deaths (7.4%) among patients with access-site bleeding (odds ratio [OR]=3.45 [2.20-5.41], p<0.001 for non-access-site bleeding vs. no bleeding and OR=1.90 [1.17-3.01], p=0.008 for access-site bleeding vs. no bleeding). Bleeding improved the discriminatory power of the multivariable model for mortality prediction (p=0.002).In patients with diabetes undergoing PCI, occurrence of bleeding within the first 30 days after PCI was associated with a significant increase in the risk of one-year mortality.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694461","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.918735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.76088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.295456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Consortium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"}]}
