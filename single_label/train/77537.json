{"id":77537,"title":"Long-term analysis of health status and preventive behavior in music students across an entire university program.","abstract":"The aim of this investigation was to analyze longitudinal data concerning physical and psychological health, playing-related problems, and preventive behavior among music students across their complete 4- to 5-year study period.In a longitudinal, observational study, we followed students during their university training and measured their psychological and physical health status and preventive behavior using standardized questionnaires at four different times.The data were in accordance with previous findings. They demonstrated three groups of health characteristics observed in beginners of music study: healthy students (cluster 1), students with preclinical symptoms (cluster 2), and students who are clinically symptomatic (cluster 3). In total, 64% of all students remained in the same cluster group during their whole university training. About 10% of the students showed considerable health problems and belonged to the third cluster group.The three clusters of health characteristics found in this longitudinal study with music students necessitate that prevention programs for musicians must be adapted to the target audience.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647455","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.62984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.599967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.510982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.401005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.392217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.374059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"University","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Musician","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician"},{"name":"Audience","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Target audience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_audience"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Business cluster","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster"},{"name":"Music school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_school"}]}
