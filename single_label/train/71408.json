{"id":71408,"title":"Marked myocardial lipoma of the left ventricle free wall.","abstract":"We report a rare case of marked myocardial lipoma of the left ventricle free wall investigated with echocardiography, CT and comprehensive MRI. The case is a 52-year-old man with a history of arrhythmia, hypertension and palpitations. Echocardiography was normal except for the base of the interventricular septum which was slightly thickened. CT and cardiac MRI showed features consistent with myocardial lipoma. This is the first report of myocardial lipoma on the left ventricle free wall depicted as perfusion defect on MR perfusion imaging.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073242","annotations":[{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.812954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.785708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.510532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.446084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.423561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Lipoma","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoma"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Star Wars Tales Volume 6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Tales_Volume_6"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
