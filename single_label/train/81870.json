{"id":81870,"title":"Malocclusion and quality of life in Brazilian preschoolers.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of malocclusion on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among preschool children and their families. This study involved 732 preschoolers. Parents/caregivers filled out the Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) and a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic data. Overbite, overjet, and crossbite were recorded during the clinical examination. Bivariate and multiple Poisson regression analyses were performed and prevalence ratio (PR) were calculated (? = 5%). The prevalence of negative impact from malocclusion on OHRQoL was 27.6% among the children and 22.3% among the families. Mother's schooling (PR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.10-1.70), parent's/caregiver's assessment of child's oral health (PR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.60-2.58), history of toothache (PR = 3.84; 95% CI: 2.34-6.30), and visits to the dentist (PR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.94) remained significantly associated with OHRQoL in the final model for the children, whereas parent's/caregiver's assessment of child's oral health (PR = 2.32; 95% CI: 1.71-3.14) and history of toothache (PR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.69-3.09) remained significantly associated with OHRQoL for the families. Malocclusion was not associated with a negative impact on OHRQoL. In contrast, parents'/caregivers' perceptions regarding the oral health of their children and a history of toothache were predictors of a negative impact on the OHRQoL.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799269","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.629539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.327004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"History","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0600848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Toothache","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"602","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/602"},{"name":"732","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/732"},{"name":"370","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370"},{"name":"346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/346"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Big Brother Brasil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_Brasil"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
