{"id":33784,"title":"Surgical experience in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I.","abstract":"Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a recently described genetic disorder with aortic and vascular involvement. Here, we present the medical history and surgical management of a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I caused by a mutation in M253I in the TGFBR1 gene who received complete aortic replacement and various peripheral vascular surgeries over the course of 25 years.
