{"id":30454,"title":"Ethyl pyruvate pretreatment attenuates concanavalin a-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice.","abstract":"Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a potent reactive oxygen species scavenger, has been reported to contribute to the inflammatory process. However, the protective effect of ethyl pyruvate on Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced autoimmune hepatitis have not been explored. Thus, the aims of this study are to investigate both the effects of ethyl pyruvate and its mechanism of protection on Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice.Acute autoimmune hepatitis was induced by Con A (20 mg/kg) in Balb/C mice; ethyl pyruvate (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) was administrated 1h prior to the Con A injection. At 3h, 6h and 24h post Con A injection, histological grading, proinflammatory cytokine levels and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) activity were determined.Following Con A challenge, cytokines TNF-?, IL-2, IL-1? and IL-6 were expressed at 3h and 6h, and the level of HMGB1 significantly increased by 24h. Pretreatment with ethyl pyruvate ameliorated the pathological effects of Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis and significantly decreased the levels of TNF-?, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1? at 3h and 6h and the level of HMGB1 at 6h and 24h post injection. Ethyl pyruvate blocked the degradation of I?B ? and I?B ? and decreased the expression of NF-?B at 24h.Taken together, these results indicated that ethyl pyruvate protected against Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis by decreasing both early (TNF-?, IL-2, IL-1? and IL-6) and late (HMGB1) cytokine expression in mice. The reduction of HMGB1 may correlate with the amelioration of NF-?B activity.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498418","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pyruvic acid","weight":0.761063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.66425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.589611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.571584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.298064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"HMGB1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGB1"},{"name":"Proinflammatory cytokine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proinflammatory_cytokine"},{"name":"Concanavalin A","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concanavalin_A"},{"name":"Ethyl group","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_group"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"}]}
