{"id":45272,"title":"Visceral abdominal fat measured by computed tomography is associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma.","abstract":"We investigated whether visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measured by computed tomography (CT) is a risk factor for colorectal adenoma. For a total of 1,328 patients (857 without adenoma, 471 with colorectal adenoma) undergoing colonoscopy and CT, associations between colorectal adenoma and body mass index (BMI), VAT area and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age, sex, family history, smoking, alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, aspirin use and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Multivariate analysis showed that colorectal adenoma was marginally associated (p=0.06) with BMI, but not with SAT, while it was significantly associated with VAT and the VAT to SAT ratio (VAT/SAT) for both categorical data and trend (p<0.05). When the obesity indices were considered simultaneously, colorectal adenoma remained significantly associated with VAT and VAT/SAT (p<0.05), but not BMI and SAT. In patients with colorectal adenoma, the adjusted OR for the highest quartiles of VAT and VAT/SAT was 1.90 (95% CI 1.16-3.13) and 2.25 (95% CI 1.49-3.41), respectively, compared to the lowest quartiles. Only VAT area was significantly associated with colorectal adenoma in both men and women (p<0.05). Proximal, multiple and advanced adenomas had significantly higher VAT areas (p<0.05) than distal, solitary and nonadvanced adenomas. Our findings implicate abdominal VAT in the development and progression of colorectal adenoma, and it was better obesity index for colorectal adenoma than BMI in both sexes.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692064","annotations":[{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.853922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.837309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.815465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.623977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.337994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.299525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.251303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.235771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Value added tax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
