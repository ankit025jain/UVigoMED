{"id":68152,"title":"Hem-o-lok clip: a neglected cause of severe bladder neck contracture and consequent urinary incontinence after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"Hem-o-lok clips are widely used during robot-assisted and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy to control the lateral pedicles. There are a few reports of hem-o-lok clip migration into the bladder or vesico-urethral anastomosis and only four cases of hem-o-lok clip migration resulting into bladder neck contracture. Herein, we describe the first case, to our knowledge, of hem-o-lok clip migration leading to severe bladder neck contracture and subsequent stress urinary incontinence.A 62-year-old Caucasian man underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for a T1c Gleason 8 prostate cancer. One month after surgery the patient was fully continent; however, three months later, he presented with acute urinary retention requiring suprapubic drainage. Urethroscopy showed a hem-o-lok clip strongly attached to the area between the vesico-urethral anastomosis and the urethral sphincter and a severe bladder neck contracture behind it. Following cold-knife urethral incision and clip removal, the bladder neck contracture was widely resected. At 3-month follow-up, the patient voided spontaneously with a peak flow rate of 9.5 ml/sec and absence of post-void residual urine, but leaked 240 ml urine at the 24-hour pad test. To date, at 1-year follow-up, his voiding situation remains unchanged.The present report provides further evidence for the risk of hem-o-lok clip migration causing bladder neck contracture, and is the first to demonstrate the potential of such complication to result into stress urinary incontinence.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555468","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.423759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.403008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Urethral sphincter","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_sphincter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.358664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.10245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Continent","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Neck of urinary bladder","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_of_urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
