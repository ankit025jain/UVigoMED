{"id":80344,"title":"Guinea worm (Dracunculiasis) eradication: update on progress and endgame challenges.","abstract":"The International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (ICCDE) met in December to review progress towards eradication. The status of the programme was presented by WHO and The Carter Center, Atlanta. The Commission received reports from international certification teams that Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and Nigeria were free of transmission and should be certified, while four countries, namely Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan, remained endemic. The Commission certified that Somalia and South Africa were free of transmission. During 2013, there was a decline of about 78% in the numbers of cases reported in South Sudan. A report of the perplexing dracunculiasis epidemiology in Chad was also discussed, where dogs have been found to be infected with Dracunculus medinensis.
