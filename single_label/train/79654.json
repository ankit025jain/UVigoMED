{"id":79654,"title":"[Epidemic situation and prevention strategy of schistosomiasis in Ya' an City after Lushan Earthquake on April 20, 2013].","abstract":"This paper analyzes the recently epidemic status of schistosomiasis, the change of natural and social factors, and field survey and evaluation data of schistosomiasis in Ya'an City after Lushan Earthquake on April 20, 2013, and proposes that it is necessary to strengthen the conventional schistosomiasis control measures, the control of exogenous infection sources, the control of Oncomelania hupensis snails and health education for ensuring no major epidemics after the disaster. This paper also recommends the direction and suggestions for future schistosomiasis control in Ya' an City.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051843","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.274307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Ya'an","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya'an"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"April 20","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_20"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Archaeological field survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_field_survey"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"}]}
