{"id":88882,"title":"Negative-pressure wound therapy over surgically closed wounds in open fractures.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome of open fracture surgery with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) applied directly over surgical wounds.Medical records of 10 men and 4 women aged 6 to 70 (mean, 43.7) years who underwent internal fixation, external fixation, or splint application for open fractures of the lower leg (n=7), foot and ankle (n=5), or knee (n=2), and NPWT were reviewed. The NPWT was applied directly over the surgical wound without a non-adherent contact layer. The foam was changed every 3 days. The standard negative pressure was 125 mm Hg. The NPWT was stopped when the wound discharge became <50 ml per day. The duration of NPWT and the level of negative pressure were recorded, as were wound condition, reasons for NPWT, and outcome.The mean duration of NPWT was 9.1 (range, 3-24) days. Four patients developed maceration of the skin under the foam, whereas 2 patients developed skin blisters under the drape. No necrosis of flap skin or infection occurred, and all the fractures eventually united.Maceration of the skin was seen in some cases but did not affect the overall outcome. NPWT directly over the skin surface had no deleterious effect on wound and fracture healing.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781609","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.675732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Blister","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.533099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.349403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.274709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
