{"id":25982,"title":"Effect of rosuvastatin on coronary flow reserve in patients with systemic hypertension.","abstract":"Although statins reduce cardiac events in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk factors, the effect of statins on coronary flow reserve (CFR) has not been examined. We tried to examine the effect of rosuvastatin on CFR in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk. CFR was studied in 56 hypertensive patients (40 men, 61 ± 9 years) with cardiovascular risk factors and without coronary artery disease in a prospective clinical trial. Using Doppler echocardiography, coronary flow velocity in the distal left anterior descending artery was recorded at baseline and during intravenous adenosine infusion, and CFR was defined as the ratio of hyperemic to basal average peak diastolic flow velocity. The primary efficacy measure was defined as the change in CFR after rosuvastatin therapy for 12 months. CFR was measured successfully in 55 of 56 enrolled patients (98%). CFR was 3.16 ± 0.44 at baseline and negatively correlated with age (R = -0.30, p = 0.025). All patients continued rosuvastatin 10 mg/day without any serious adverse events. After rosuvastatin therapy, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly decreased from 222 ± 18 to 142 ± 20 mg/dl, 148 ± 21 to 85 ± 18 mg/dl, and 1.7 ± 2.9 to 1.2 ± 3.1 mg/L, respectively (all p <0.01). CFR significantly increased from 3.16 ± 0.44 to 3.31 ± 0.42 (p <0.001). The change in CFR correlated with the change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (R = -0.28, p = 0.040) but not with the change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In conclusion, CFR was significantly improved after 12 months of rosuvastatin therapy in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk and average levels of serum cholesterol.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159238","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.797516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.762615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.672562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.448612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.350474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.350303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Rosuvastatin","weight":0.221367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosuvastatin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Hyperaemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaemia"},{"name":"Doppler echocardiography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_echocardiography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
