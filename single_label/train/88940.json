(2) Design a treatment plan to offer tourniquet-free, sedation-free local anesthesia for patients who wish it or who are at high risk with sedation. (3) Describe the evidence and outcomes as they relate to splinting carpal tunnel patients after surgery.This is the third Maintenance of Certification article on carpal tunnel syndrome. Hentz and Lalonde summarized the best literature in 2008 in the first article. The second article, by Shores and Lee, presented the best evidence regarding assessment, surgical treatment, and outcomes from the literature published between 1999 and 2009.
