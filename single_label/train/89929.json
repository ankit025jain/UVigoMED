{"id":89929,"title":"Animal study assessing safety of an acoustic coupling fluid that holds the potential to avoid surgically induced artifacts in 3D ultrasound guided operations.","abstract":"Use of ultrasound in brain tumor surgery is common. The difference in attenuation between brain and isotonic saline may cause artifacts that degrade the ultrasound images, potentially affecting resection grades and safety. Our research group has developed an acoustic coupling fluid that attenuates ultrasound energy like the normal brain. We aimed to test in animals if the newly developed acoustic coupling fluid may have harmful effects.Eight rats were included for intraparenchymal injection into the brain, and if no adverse reactions were detected, 6 pigs were to be included with injection of the coupling fluid into the subarachnoid space. Animal behavior, EEG registrations, histopathology and immunohistochemistry were used in assessment.In total, 14 animals were included, 8 rats and 6 pigs. We did not detect any clinical adverse effects, seizure activity on EEG or histopathological signs of tissue damage.The novel acoustic coupling fluid intended for brain tumor surgery appears safe in rats and pigs under the tested circumstances.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666721","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.872065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.731425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.480002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.47098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Ethology","weight":0.346139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.338568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.287322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.28183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.249659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.211952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"3D ultrasound","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_ultrasound"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"}]}
