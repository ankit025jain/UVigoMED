{"id":46293,"title":"Impact of IL28B genetic variation on HCV-induced liver fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"IL28B polymorphisms were shown to be strongly associated with the response to interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and spontaneous viral clearance. However, little is known about how these polymorphisms affect the natural course of the disease. Thus, we conducted the present meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL28B polymorphisms on disease progression.A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Integrated odds ratios (OR) were calculated with a fixed-effects or random-effects model based on heterogeneity analyses.We identified 28 studies that included 10,024 patients. The pooled results indicated that the rs12979860 genotype CC was significantly associated (vs. genotype CT/TT; OR, 1.122; 95%CI, 1.003-1.254; P?=?0.044), and that the rs8099917 genotype TT tended to be (vs. genotype TG/GG; OR, 1.126; 95%CI, 0.988-1.284; P?=?0.076) associated, with an increased possibility of severe fibrosis. Both rs12979860 CC (vs. CT/TT; OR, 1.288; 95%CI, 1.050-1.581; P?=?0.015) and rs8099917 TT (vs. TG/GG; OR, 1.324; 95%CI, 1.110-1.579; P?=?0.002) were significantly associated with a higher possibility of severe inflammation activity. Rs8099917 TT was also significantly associated with a lower possibility of severe steatosis (vs. TG/GG; OR, 0.580; 95%CI, 0.351-0.959; P?=?0.034), whereas rs12979860 CC was not associated with hepatic steatosis (vs. CT/TT; OR, 1.062; 95%CI, 0.415-2.717; P?=?0.901).IL28B polymorphisms appeared to modify the natural course of disease in patients with CHC. Disease progression seems to be promoted in patients with the rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT genotypes.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637774","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.551338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.168625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
