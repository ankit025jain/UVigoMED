{"id":81421,"title":"Research on plasma and saliva levels of some bivalent cations in patients with chronic periodontitis (salivary cations in chronic periodontitis).","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic periodontitis can stand behind modifications in the salivary and blood concentration of some bivalent cations (Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc and Copper). For this purpose, we formed a group of 30 adult patients with clinically onset chronic periodontitis, and another one of 30 healthy patients as control. Both groups were free from acute oral pathology and general illnesses. The groups were divided again according to the habit of smoking. Total saliva samples were obtained as \"first time in the morning\", then weighed and processed. Cations were read on Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and by Ion Chromatography (Magnesium). The same patients were required to undergo laboratory blood tests for Calcium, Magnesium and Zinc. Data obtained was normalised, then statistically interpreted using two-tailed heteroscedastic t-Student tests. Our data confirmed the existence of a connection between salivary calcium, magnesium, zinc and copper, and of blood magnesium, and chronic periodontitis. Salivary calcium and magnesium are affected by smoking.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076713","annotations":[{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.783206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.778832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.672122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.666938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.446471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Ion chromatography","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_chromatography"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.409197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.316595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.270908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Divalent","weight":0.186947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divalent"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.161805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Atomic absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_disease"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Crystal habit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_habit"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
