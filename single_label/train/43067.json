{"id":43067,"title":"Therapeutic potential of microRNA: a new target to treat intrahepatic portal hypertension?","abstract":"Intrahepatic portal hypertension accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality encountered in patients with liver cirrhosis, due to increased portal inflow and intrahepatic vascular resistance. Most treatments have focused only on portal inflow or vascular resistance. However, miRNA multitarget regulation therapy may potentially intervene in these two processes for therapeutic benefit in cirrhosis and portal hypertension. This review presents an overview of the most recent knowledge of and future possibilities for the use of miRNA therapy. The benefits of this therapeutic modality--which is poorly applied in the clinical setting--are still uncertain. Increasing the knowledge and current understanding of the roles of miRNAs in the development of intrahepatic portal hypertension and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) functions, as well as their potential as novel drug targets, is critical.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812632","annotations":[{"name":"Death","weight":0.831478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.804062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.749819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Vascular resistance","weight":0.572521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_resistance"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.405869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.213079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Kupffer cell","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell"},{"name":"Hepatic stellate cell","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_stellate_cell"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
