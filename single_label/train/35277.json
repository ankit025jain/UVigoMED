{"id":35277,"title":"Co-existence of clonal expanded autologous and transplacental-acquired maternal T cells in recombination activating gene-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency.","abstract":"It is commonly accepted that the presence of high amounts of maternal T cells excludes Omenn syndrome (OS) in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). We report a SCID patient with a novel mutation in the recombination activating gene (RAG)1 gene (4-BP DEL.1406 TTGC) who presented with immunodeficiency and OS. Several assays, including representatives of specific T cell receptors (TCR), V? families and TCR-? rearrangements, were performed in order to understand more clearly the nature and origin of the patient's T cells. The patient had oligoclonal T cells which, based on the patient-mother human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B50 mismatch, were either autologous or of maternal origin. These cell populations were different in their numbers of regulatory T cells (T(reg)) and the diversity of TCR repertoires. This is the first description of the co-existence of large amounts of clonal expanded autologous and transplacental-acquired maternal T cells in RAG1-deficient SCID.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666246","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Severe combined immunodeficiency","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.859167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.82342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.442883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.405089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.38546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Recombination activating gene","weight":0.347041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_activating_gene"},{"name":"Omenn syndrome","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omenn_syndrome"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0652231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"}]}
