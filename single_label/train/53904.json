{"id":53904,"title":"Security and efficiency of a closed-system, turbulent-flow circuit for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy after cytoreductive ovarian surgery: perioperative outputs.","abstract":"To present physiologic intraoperative data and immediate postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer submitted to cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic peritoneal intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) with a closed-circuit, turbulent-flow system.A closed-circuit system with CO2 turbulent flow was used for paclitaxel HIPEC during 60 min for patients diagnosed with stage II or higher and recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Perioperative hemodynamic and metabolic statuses were followed, as well as physiologic recovery during the first 12 postoperative hours. A non-parametric statistical analysis was performed.At the end of the hyperthermia phase, temperature was 37.7 ± 0.6 °C, heart rate 88 ± 19 bpm, cardiac index 2.8 ± 0.5 L min(-1) m(-2), stroke volume variation 14.6 ± 3.6 % and extravascular lung water 8.7 ± 1.9 mL kg(-1). No hyperdynamic status was recorded. The length of stay in the ICU was 2½ days, and 12.7 ± 7 days in hospital. Average postoperative intubation time was 11.7 ± 17.4 h. At the ICU admission time, glucose, lactic acid and hemoglobin were the only values out of range, but close to normal. SOFA median was 3 at admission and 0 the following day.A turbulent-flow, closed-circuit use for hyperthermic peritoneal intraoperative chemotherapy resulted in no hyperdynamic response or coagulopathy, had good tolerance and promoted early physiologic recovery.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Endocrine System
