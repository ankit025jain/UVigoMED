{"id":47255,"title":"Association of HLA-DRB1 alleles and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in Han and Uyghur patients with ulcerative colitis in China.","abstract":"We aimed to study the association between HLA-DRB1 alleles and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) among Uyghur and Han patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in China.Altogether 160 UC patients and 466 healthy controls of Uyghur and Han groups residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China were included. HLA-DRB1 variants were identified from genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing. Serum ANCA were determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay.Among the Uyghur populations, the HLA-DRB1*08 gene frequency was lower in the UC patients than in the control group (P?=?0.012, OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.91); however, that of HLA-DRB1*13 was much higher in the UC patients than in the controls (P?=?0.001, OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.92-9.74). In Han patients with UC, there was no significant difference in HLA-DRB1 frequency between UC patients and healthy controls. The positive rate of ANCA in Uyghur patients with UC was significantly higher than in Han UC patients (P?=?0.026), and ANCA positivity was associated with an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*13 in Uyghur UC patients, but no such difference was observed in the Han patients.Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA-DRB1*08 and *13 may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of UC between Uyghur and Han UC patients in China. In Uyghur UC patients, HLA-DRB1*13 may be correlated with ANCA positivity.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597629","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.865444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.850728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"China","weight":0.652292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.456781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.326066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.23601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Xinjiang","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.147756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-neutrophil_cytoplasmic_antibody"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"}]}
