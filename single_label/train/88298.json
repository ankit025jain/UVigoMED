{"id":88298,"title":"Does the wedge wing in the neck screw prevent cut-out failure in Ota/AO 31-A2 trochanteric fractures in elderly patients?","abstract":"The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effects of Dyna Locking Trochanteric (DLT) nail (U & I Corporation 529-1, Yonghyun-dong, Uijungbu Kyunggi-Do, Korea 480-050) in 31-A1 and 31-A2 intertrochanteric femur fractures. Eighty-seven patients (63 female and 24 male, mean age 77 years) were treated. The mean duration of followup was 16.6 +/- 3.1 months (range, 12-24 months). There were 36 cases of 31-A1 and 51 cases of 31-A2 fractures. The duration of surgery, fluoroscopy screening time, the blood loss, the hospital stay, the tip-apex distance were significantly less in the 31-A1 fracture group compared with the 31-A2 fracture group (p < 0.001). Cut-out was observed in 13 patients (14.9%) above 80 years old with 31-A2 fractures. Especially in elderly patients with unstable 31-A2 fractures, the wedge wing on the neck screw does not work properly. Therefore further biomechanical investigations and also prospective clinical studies with larger series are needed to improve the device.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873081","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.641105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.479276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.454935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.453752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.370858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0508816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Wing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing"},{"name":"1224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1224"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Cutout animation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_animation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Toyota Dyna","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Dyna"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Bannered routes of U.S. Route 31","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannered_routes_of_U.S._Route_31"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"}]}
