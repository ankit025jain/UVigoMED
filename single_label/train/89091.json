{"id":89091,"title":"Postoperative hemorrhage in an elderly patient with a glioblastoma multiform and a calcified chronic subdural hematoma.","abstract":"Cases with brain tumor and subdural hematoma are rare; surgical management of the elderly patients with a glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and a chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) can be intractable.We report a 77-year-old patient, who had a left front lobe GBM and a giant, calcified, left frontoparietaloccipitotemporal CSDH. The patient recovered well from anesthesia after removal of the GBM and CSDH. However, the patient developed severe hemiplegia and aphasia because of the in-situ hemorrhage 1 day later. Laboratory tests indicated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) leading to the postoperative hemorrhage. The patient was left with hemiparesis and alalia after the in-situ hematoma evacuation.We presume elderly patients have a higher incidence of postoperative hemorrhage in residual intracranial cavity owing to higher possibility to get DIC. A less aggressive surgical management could be a more appropriate choice.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754873","annotations":[{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Hemiparesis","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiparesis"},{"name":"Hemiplegia","weight":0.855339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiplegia"},{"name":"Aphasia","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.727706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.408764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.342038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.331648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
