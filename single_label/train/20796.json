{"id":20796,"title":"Comparison between emerging Q fever in French Guiana and endemic Q fever in Marseille, France.","abstract":"Q fever is an emergent disease in French Guiana. We compared the incidence clinical and serologic profiles between patients from Cayenne, French Guiana and Marseille in metropolitan France during a four-year period. The annual incidence of diagnosed acute Q fever was significantly higher in Cayenne (17.5/100,000) than in Marseille (1.9/100,000) (P = 0.0004), but not the annual incidence of endocarditis (1.29 versus 0.34/100,000). Most patients had fever (97%) and pneumonia (83%) in Cayenne versus 81% and 8% in Marseille (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively) but transaminitis was more common in patients from Marseille (54% versus 32%; P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with cardiovascular infections was significantly lower in Cayenne (7%) than in Marseille (17%) (P = 0.017), although they showed a stronger immune response with higher levels of phase I IgG (P = 0.024). The differing epidemiology, clinical, and serologic responses of patients from Cayenne and Marseille suggest a different source of infection and a different strain of Coxiella burnetii.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639301","annotations":[{"name":"Q fever","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_fever"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"France","weight":0.692908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Coxiella burnetii","weight":0.521577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxiella_burnetii"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.453533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Marseille","weight":0.358226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.25977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.211175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"French Guiana","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana"},{"name":"Cayenne","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayenne"},{"name":"Rainforest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"}]}
