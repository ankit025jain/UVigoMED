{"id":47195,"title":"An audit of chronic hepatitis B contact tracing in metropolitan Western Australia.","abstract":"People with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are a source of transmission and those in contact with them are a national priority population for hepatitis B testing and vaccination. This audit examined contact tracing success rate and barriers. Success was defined as contacts tested and vaccinated if required.An online survey of 26 general practitioners (GPs), and computer-assisted telephone interviews of 40 patients with CHB notified between 1 September 2011 and 1 September 2012.Half of the patients with CHB (16/31) were asked to take responsibility for informing contacts; contacts of five patients were traced by doctors and those of three patients were traced by nurses. The overall success rate was 75%. Contact tracing by nurses was 100% successful; after excluding nurse contact tracing from the analysis, the success rate was 57%. GPs reported 'insufficient resources' as the most frequent doctor-related barrier to contact tracing and 58% of doctors reported that public health units should be responsible for contact tracing.Increasing contact tracing by nurses could improve success rates. Public health unit assistance for contact tracing of complex cases should continue.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600677","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.839577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Western Australia","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.311024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Contact tracing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1631","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1631"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"Health (gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(gaming)"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Charlotte Bobcats","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats"},{"name":"Tracing (software)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)"}]}
