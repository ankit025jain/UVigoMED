{"id":51996,"title":"Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer: The AURELIA open-label randomized phase III trial.","abstract":"In platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (OC), single-agent chemotherapy is standard. Bevacizumab is active alone and in combination. AURELIA is the first randomized phase III trial to our knowledge combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy in platinum-resistant OC.Eligible patients had measurable/assessable OC that had progressed < 6 months after completing platinum-based therapy. Patients with refractory disease, history of bowel obstruction, or > two prior anticancer regimens were ineligible. After investigators selected chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel, or topotecan), patients were randomly assigned to single-agent chemotherapy alone or with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Crossover to single-agent bevacizumab was permitted after progression with chemotherapy alone. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety, and patient-reported outcomes.The PFS hazard ratio (HR) after PFS events in 301 of 361 patients was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.60; unstratified log-rank P < .001). Median PFS was 3.4 months with chemotherapy alone versus 6.7 months with bevacizumab-containing therapy. RECIST ORR was 11.8% versus 27.3%, respectively (P = .001). The OS HR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.08; P < .174; median OS, 13.3 v 16.6 months, respectively). Grade ? 2 hypertension and proteinuria were more common with bevacizumab. GI perforation occurred in 2.2% of bevacizumab-treated patients.Adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy statistically significantly improved PFS and ORR; the OS trend was not significant. No new safety signals were observed.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637997","annotations":[{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.8214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Topotecan","weight":0.624898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topotecan"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.619895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.6027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.4365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.41097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.357753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.205318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Chromosomal crossover","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
