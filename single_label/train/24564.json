{"id":24564,"title":"Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after implantation of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds: lessons from optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"The current case report demonstrates the interesting finding of incomplete bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) strut coverage at 18 months after implantation for a chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In this case, local differences in shear stress could explain the simultaneous presence of well covered and uncovered BVS strut segments in the same optical coherence tomography frame. Even though current standard practice suggests dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months after BVS implantation, further studies are required to establish optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, particularly when tackling complex lesions.
