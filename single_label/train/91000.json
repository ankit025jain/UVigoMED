{"id":91000,"title":"Telemetric intracranial pressure monitoring in blast-induced traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"The long-term monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is important for the management of acute and chronic neuropathological conditions which include head injury, traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus, etc. In this study, we developed an implantable device for measuring ICP over long periods of time in an animal model of blast-induced brain injury. The performance of the device was first evaluated in vitro and subsequently utilized to measure ICP in rats exposed to blast overpressures. The effects of blast-induced brain injury on ICP were measured for six days. A significant difference was observed between the injured group and the nonexposed control group. ICP in injured animals showed a biphasic transient increase; an immediate increase within the first 1-3Â h and a more gradual elevation occurring two days after the blast. The ability to monitor changes of ICP continuously over long periods after brain injury and during the course of treatment may improve the prognosis after injury and can also serve as a tool in determining the therapeutic effectiveness of new drugs.
