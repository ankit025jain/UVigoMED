{"id":72338,"title":"Internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene confers poor overall survival in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy: an International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia","abstract":"Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene (FLT3-ITD) are associated with poor outcome in acute myeloid leukemia, but their prognostic impact in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remains controversial. Here, we screened for FLT3-ITD mutations in 171 APL patients, treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. We identified FLT3-ITD mutations in 35 patients (20 %). FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with higher white blood cell counts (P < 0.0001), relapse-risk score (P = 0.0007), higher hemoglobin levels (P = 0.0004), higher frequency of the microgranular morphology (M3v) subtype (P = 0.03), and the short PML/RARA (BCR3) isoform (P < 0.0001). After a median follow-up of 38 months, FLT3-ITD(positive) patients had a lower 3-year overall survival rate (62 %) compared with FLT3-ITD(negative) patients (82 %) (P = 0.006). The prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD on survival was retained in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio: 2.39, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.17-4.89; P = 0.017). Nevertheless, complete remission (P = 0.07), disease-free survival (P = 0.24), and the cumulative incidence of relapse (P = 0.94) rates were not significantly different between groups. We can conclude that FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with several hematologic features in APL, in particular with high white blood cell counts. In addition, FLT3-ITD may independently predict a shorter survival in patients with APL treated with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981688","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"CD135","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD135"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.856791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia","weight":0.849269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.741283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Retinoic acid","weight":0.709591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.662401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.539893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"BCR gene","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCR_gene"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.326611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.273912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.251096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.231061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Tretinoin","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretinoin"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.174982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.14971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
