{"id":68809,"title":"Nephrotoxicity of concomitant use of tacrolimus and teicoplanin in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","abstract":"Both tacrolimus and glycopeptide antibiotics are known to be nephrotoxic, and are often concomitantly given after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the nephrotoxicity of concomitant use of tacrolimus and glycopeptide antibiotics in HSCT recipients. We retrospectively evaluated 67 patients who received intravenous tacrolimus and teicoplanin concomitantly for >4 days after allogeneic HSCT for hematologic diseases. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was performed in all patients for both tacrolimus and teicoplanin. The median age of the patients was 48 years (range: 16-62), and the median duration of the co-administration of tacrolimus and teicoplanin was 11 days (range: 4-40). The mean serum creatinine (sCr) level tended to be elevated after the co-administration (from 0.69 ± 0.26 to 0.75 ± 0.30 mg/dL; P = 0.08); however, a 2-fold or greater increase in sCr was observed only in 2 (3.0%) patients. Increased sCr was reversible, and no patient required hemodialysis. These results suggest that the incidence of clinically significant nephrotoxicity can be minimized if the TDM of each drug is properly applied.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494811","annotations":[{"name":"Teicoplanin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teicoplanin"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.748291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.743165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glycopeptide","weight":0.631667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycopeptide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapeutic drug monitoring","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_drug_monitoring"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Hematologic disease","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematologic_disease"},{"name":"Glycopeptide antibiotic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycopeptide_antibiotic"}]}
