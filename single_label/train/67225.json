{"id":67225,"title":"Changes in sexual function of women with refractory interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome after intravesical therapy with a hyaluronic acid solution.","abstract":"Intravesical instillation with a hyaluronic acid (HA) solution is an effective treatment for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), but its impact on sexual functioning of patients is not known.The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in sexual function of women with refractory IC/BPS who underwent a second-line intravesical HA therapy.A total of 103 women diagnosed with refractory IC/BPS were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter study. Sexual function was evaluated using the short form of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-9). Bladder-related symptoms and bother were assessed by the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) and Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI), and a pain visual analog scale (VAS), respectively. Data were analyzed with univariate methods or multivariate logistic regression analysis accordingly.Changes in PISQ-9, ICSI, ICPI, and pain VAS scores after treatment were assessed.Mean age and duration of symptoms was 43.6?±?11.8 and 5.1?±?5.0 years, respectively. ICSI, ICPI, and pain VAS scores were significantly (P?<?0.001) improved after 1 month and 6 months of treatment. Of the 87 (84.5%) sexually active women evaluated, PISQ-9 total scores improved significantly (P?<?0.001) from the baseline (mean 18.9?±?6.4), after 1 month (20.4?±?5.8), and 6-months (21.5?±?5.6) of treatment. Significantly improved PISQ-9 items included \"dyspareunia\" (P?<?0.001) and \"negative reactions\" (P?=?0.015) during sexual intercourse, and \"intensity\" (P?<?0.001) of sexual orgasms. After a logistic regression analysis, we found that a baseline PISQ-9 score was negatively correlated with the duration of IC/BPS symptoms (P?=?0.022). Meanwhile, the changes in PISQ-9 scores were positively correlated with the reduction in ICSI scores after treatment (P?=?0.045).Intravesical HA is an effective treatment for refractory IC/BPS. A longer duration of IC/BPS symptoms may be a predictor of poor sexual function. However, intravesical HA may improve sexual function along with the reduction of IC/BPS symptoms.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Male Urogenital
