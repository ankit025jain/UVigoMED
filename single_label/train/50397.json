{"id":50397,"title":"Assessment and management of male androgen disorders: an update.","abstract":"Male hypogonadism, caused by intrinsic pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis, is an under-diagnosed condition not to be missed. By contrast, late onset hypogonadism (LOH), due to functional suppression of the HPT axis from age-related comorbidities, may be less common than previously believed.This article outlines the aetiology, clinical features, investigation and management of male hypogonadism and discusses the more controversial area of LOH.Pathologically based hypogonadism is, after a thorough diagnostic work-up, treated with testosterone replacement therapy, unless fertility is desired. LOH with modest reductions in testosterone levels should primarily be managed by attention to lifestyle measures, especially weight loss, and optimisation of comorbidities. Clear treatment goals should be identified, and efficacy and safety should be monitored according to published clinical practice guidelines.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791767","annotations":[{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.753561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.549757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.509956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.135398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0585634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Androgen replacement therapy","weight":0.0315646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Loss of heterozygosity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_heterozygosity"},{"name":"High Performance Teams","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Teams"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
