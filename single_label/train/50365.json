{"id":50365,"title":"Diabetic foot ulcer management: the podiatrist's perspective.","abstract":"Diabetic foot complications result from two broad pathologies-neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic feet. It is important for diabetic patients to have at least a yearly review of foot ulcer risk factors, and they should have a corresponding risk classification agreed based on this assessment. Diabetic foot ulcer assessment should include a wound classification tool, which can give an indication of wounds at greater risk of non-healing or amputation. The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers should be part of a comprehensive care plan that should also include treatment of infection, frequent debridement (if deemed appropriate by a skilled specialist clinician), biomechanical offloading, blood glucose control and treatment of comorbidities. Clinicians should base dressing selection on the wound's location, size and depth, amount of exudate, presence of infection or necrosis and the condition of the surrounding tissue.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796080","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.677067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Podiatry","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podiatry"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.462485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.383676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.306204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.135821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
