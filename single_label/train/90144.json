{"id":90144,"title":"Clinical Trials Express: fracture risk reduction with denosumab in Japanese postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis: denosumab fracture intervention randomized placebo controlled trial (DIRECT).","abstract":"Denosumab 60 mg sc injection every 6 months for 36 months was well tolerated and effective in reducing the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fracture in predominantly Caucasian postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.The objective of this phase 3 fracture study was to examine the antifracture efficacy and safety of denosumab 60 mg in Japanese women and men with osteoporosis compared with placebo.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label active comparator as a referential arm was conducted.Subjects were 1262 Japanese patients with osteoporosis aged 50 years or older, who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures.Subjects were randomly assigned to receive denosumab 60 mg sc every 6 months (n = 500), placebo for denosumab (n = 511), or oral alendronate 35 mg weekly (n = 251). All subjects received daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D.The primary endpoint was the 24-month incidence of new or worsening vertebral fracture for denosumab vs placebo.Denosumab significantly reduced the risk of new or worsening vertebral fracture by 65.7%, with incidences of 3.6% in denosumab and 10.3% in placebo at 24 months (hazard ratio 0.343; 95% confidence interval 0.194-0.606, P = .0001). No apparent difference in adverse events was found between denosumab and placebo during the first 24 months of the study.These results provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of denosumab 60 mg sc every 6 months in Japanese subjects with osteoporosis.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646104","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.811368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Alendronic acid","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alendronic_acid"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.444284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.404058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.393287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.365554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.241807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0602196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"End point of clinical trials","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_point_of_clinical_trials"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Reference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
