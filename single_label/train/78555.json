{"id":78555,"title":"Basal cell carcinomas of the ear are more aggressive than on other head and neck locations.","abstract":"On pathology review, basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) on the ear more commonly present as aggressive subtypes. It is unclear if this histologic observation translates into more clinically aggressive tumors.We sought to determine the clinical aggressiveness of ear BCCs compared with BCCs elsewhere on the head and neck.We conducted a retrospective chart review of all BCCs treated at an academic center from 2005 through 2012. Subjects were divided into ear and non-ear groups. Subtypes classified as \"aggressive\" included morpheaform, infiltrative, micronodular, adenoid, metatypical, and mixed histology.Of the 7732 head and neck BCCs, 758 (9.8%) were on the ear. Ear BCCs presented as larger lesions (1.28 vs 0.98 cm(2)), required more Mohs layers (16.5% vs 10.7%), and produced a larger final defect (4.29 vs 3.49 cm(2)) than non-ear lesions. When comparing only aggressive subtypes, ear BCCs also presented as larger lesions (1.42 vs 1.23 cm(2)), more frequently required 3 or more layers for clearance (22.3% vs 14.2%), and produced a larger final defect (4.92 vs 4.21 cm(2)) than non-ear lesions.Limitations include single-center design and lack of long-term follow-up.Ear BCCs appear to exhibit greater subclinical extension compared with non-ear head and neck BCCs. Therefore, the ear should be considered a high-risk location for BCCs.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629996","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.490986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pharyngeal tonsil","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_tonsil"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.336243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.208234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Ossicles","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Mohs scale of mineral hardness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness"},{"name":"758","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/758"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Think tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"23-centimeter band","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-centimeter_band"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Hydrogen line","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line"}]}
