{"id":45925,"title":"HLA-DR polymorphism and primary biliary cirrhosis: evidence from a meta-analysis.","abstract":"We undertook this study to review and quantitatively analyze the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR polymorphisms and susceptibility of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).All relevant publications on the association between HLA-DR polymorphisms and PBC were searched through June 2013. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) for the comparisons between case and control group were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 11.0 software.Nineteen articles (or 20 studies including the substudies) were identified. For DR*7 allele, the ORs (95% CIs) were 1.530 (1.310, 1.788), 1.757 (1.285, 2.403) and 1.495 (1.211, 1.845) in overall, Asian and European populations, respectively. For DR*8 alleles, the ORs (95% CIs) were 3.158 (1.822, 5.475), 2.803 (2.420, 3.247) and 3.056 (2.573, 3.629) in Asian, American and European subgroups, respectively. The subgroup analysis for DR*11 and DR*13 showed a significant association in Asian and European population. For DR*12 and *15 alleles, the overall ORs (95% CIs) were 0.551 (0.404, 0.753) and 0.721 (0.607, 0.857). However, in subgroup analysis for DR*12 allele, the association was only found in Asian population. In addition, statistical significance exists in American and European populations in the subgroup analysis for DR*15 allele.Our meta-analysis suggested that HLA-DR *7 and *8 allele polymorphisms contributed to the susceptibility of PBC, whereas DR*11, *12, *13 and *15 allele polymorphisms are protective factors in certain population.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System
