{"id":85812,"title":"The transcriptional repression activity of STAF65? is facilitated by promoter tethering and nuclear import of class IIa histone deacetylases.","abstract":"Aberrant expression levels of transcriptional regulators result in alterations in transcriptional control. STAF65? is a structural subunit of the GCN5 transcriptional co-activator complex. Reports showed that STAF65? is highly expressed in several human cancer cells, but the consequences of this aberrant expression pattern remain elusive. Here, we show that the STAF65? protein is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients and high levels of STAF65? correlate with poor prognosis. High levels of STAF65? cause repression of the c-Myc oncogene through physical association with transcription factor YY1 and co-repressors HDACs. Physical interactions between STAF65? and class IIa HDACs facilitate nuclear enrichment and regulate the assembly of HDAC complexes. Moreover, SUMOylation of STAF65? is necessary for maintaining the co-repressor complex containing YY1 and class IIa HDACs at the promoter. Our findings reveal a distinct role of STAF65? in nuclear import, transcriptional repression, and cell cycle regulation at high levels of expression, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma.
