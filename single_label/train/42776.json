{"id":42776,"title":"Safety and utility of single-session endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for the evaluation of pancreatobiliary diseases.","abstract":"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are essential for diagnosing and treating pancreatobiliary diseases. Single-session EUS and ERCP are considered to be essential in reducing the duration of hospital stays; however, complications are a primary concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-session EUS and ERCP. Sixty-eight patients underwent single-session EUS and ERCP at a tertiary referral center between June 2008 and December 2012. We retrospectively reviewed patient data from a prospectively maintained EUS-ERCP database and evaluated the procedural characteristics and complications. Thirty-eight patients (56%) underwent diagnostic EUS, and 30 patients (44%) underwent EUS fine-needle aspiration, which had an overall accuracy of 100%. Sixty patients (89%) underwent therapeutic ERCP, whereas the remaining eight procedures were diagnostic. Thirteen patients underwent biliary stone extraction, and 48 underwent biliary drainage. The median total procedural time was 75 minutes. Complications were observed in seven patients (10%). Six complications were post-ERCP pancreatitis, which were resolved using conservative management. One patient developed Mallory-Weiss syndrome, which required endoscopic hemostasis. No sedation-related cardiopulmonary complications were observed. Single-session EUS and ERCP provided accurate diagnosis and effective management with a minimal complication rate.
