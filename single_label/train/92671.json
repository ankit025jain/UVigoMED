{"id":92671,"title":"A 1,320-nm Nd: YAG laser for improving the appearance of onychomycosis.","abstract":"Onychomycosis is a therapeutic challenge because of the toxicities of systemic medications. This has led to the investigation of light-based technologies for safe and effective alternative treatment modalities.The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 4 treatments with a 1,320-nm neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in improving the appearance of onychomycosis.This study was a 24-week, single-center randomized placebo-controlled study. Ten subjects were enrolled with culture-proven, bilateral great toenail onychomycosis. The subjects received 4 treatments with the 1,320-nm Nd:YAG laser to the treatment toenail on Days 1, 7, 14, and 60. The control toenail received a sham treatment of cryogen cooling only. Mycologic cultures were obtained at 3-month follow-up visits.Fifty percent of mycologic cultures were negative at the 3-month follow-up after 4 laser treatments. Toenails had improvement in subungual debris, hypertrophy, and yellowing. Patient satisfaction was upheld as assessed by the Nail Quality of Life Questionnaire.The 1,320-nm Nd:YAG laser may be a safe and effective therapy for improving the appearance of onychomycosis. Additional therapy may be necessary to enhance long-term results. Further investigation needs to explore the optimal treatment settings and the most effective treatment schedule.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25357174","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.570819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.522552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.474564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Garnet","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnet"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cryogenics","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics"},{"name":"Yttrium","weight":0.3,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.276104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.237206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.235123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neodymium","weight":0.065579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Mycology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology"},{"name":"Yttrium aluminium garnet","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet"},{"name":"Onychomycosis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"New Georgia Campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Georgia_Campaign"},{"name":"Air conditioning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning"},{"name":"Ungual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungual"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Debris","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_1"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
