{"id":57229,"title":"The role of regulatory T cells in preeclampsia.","abstract":"Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder of unknown cause that is unique to human pregnancy affecting about 7-10% of pregnant women. CD4+CD25(bright) regulatory T (Treg) cells have been identified as a principle regulator of tolerance during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the change of peripheral CD4+CD25(bright) regulatory T lymphocytes in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia, and to explore its role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. We determined CD4+CD25(bright) Treg cells in the peripheral blood using flow cytometry and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3+) cells at the peripheral blood using real time PCR. 30 preeclamptic cases (group 1), 10 normal pregnancy subjects (group 2) and 10 non-pregnant healthy controls (group 3) were included. There was a highly significant decrease as regards Treg count and percentage in preeclamptic cases compared to normal pregnancy subjects (P < 0.001), decrease in preeclamptic cases compared to non-pregnant healthy controls (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in normal pregnancy subjects compared to non-pregnant healthy controls (P < 0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease as regards RQ of foxp3 gene expression in preeclamptic cases compared to normal pregnancy subjects (P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between RQ and studied variables in preeclamptic cases (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that the number of Treg cells are decreased in preeclampsia, and this decrease may break the maternal tolerance to the fetus.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204044","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.534536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.454088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.408308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.337377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.231926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.221893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"FOX proteins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOX_proteins"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"}]}
