{"id":86786,"title":"[Effectiveness of tolvaptan for postoperative heart failure in a patient with combined valvular disease and pulmonary hypertension].","abstract":"We report a case of a 60-year-old man with postoperative congestive heart failure( CHF) successfully treated with tolvaptan. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension due to mitral stenosis and regurgitation combined with tricuspid regurgitation. He underwent mitral and tricuspid valvuloplasty. His postoperative course was uneventful until CHF symptoms secondary to volume overload appeared on the 4th day. Congestion with pulmonary hypertension was treated with 0.042 ?g/kg/min of intravenous human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP). His condition improved, and on the 11th postoperative day, he was weaned off hANP;oral administration of 40 mg per day of furosemide was initiated. However, 2 days after discontinuation of intravenous hANP, CHF recurred and serum sodium decreased to 128 mEq/l. Oral tolvaptan 7.5 mg per day was added to the furosemide, and CHF and hyponatremia subsequently improved. In this case, oral tolvaptan was effective for the treatment of refractory CHF with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery.
