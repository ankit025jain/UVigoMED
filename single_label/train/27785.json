{"id":27785,"title":"Bidirectional modulation of incubation of cocaine craving by silent synapse-based remodeling of prefrontal cortex to accumbens projections.","abstract":"Glutamatergic projections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) contribute to cocaine relapse. Here we show that silent synapse-based remodeling of the two major mPFC-to-NAc projections differentially regulated the progressive increase in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). Specifically, cocaine self-administration in rats generated AMPA receptor-silent glutamatergic synapses within both infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic mPFC (PrL) to NAc projections, measured after 1 day of withdrawal. After 45 days of withdrawal, IL-to-NAc silent synapses became unsilenced/matured by recruiting calcium-permeable (CP) AMPARs, whereas PrL-to-NAc silent synapses matured by recruiting non-CP-AMPARs, resulting in differential remodeling of these projections. Optogenetic reversal of silent synapse-based remodeling of IL-to-NAc and PrL-to-NAc projections potentiated and inhibited, respectively, incubation of cocaine craving on withdrawal day 45. Thus, pro- and antirelapse circuitry remodeling is induced in parallel after cocaine self-administration. These results may provide substrates for utilizing endogenous antirelapse mechanisms to reduce cocaine relapse.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199705","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleus accumbens","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"},{"name":"Prefrontal cortex","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.765266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"AMPA","weight":0.668642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.128057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Silent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"},{"name":"Allosteric regulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosteric_regulation"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Neural pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"},{"name":"Renovation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation"},{"name":"Electronic circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit"},{"name":"Ventromedial prefrontal cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventromedial_prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Tanha","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanha"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"}]}
