{"id":79564,"title":"Prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis antibodies among a rural Appalachian population--Kentucky, 2013.","abstract":"We investigated whether Strongyloides infection remains endemic in rural Kentucky's Appalachian regions; 7 of 378 (1.9%) participants tested positive for Strongyloides antibodies. We identified no statistically significant association between a positive test and travel to a known endemic country (P = 0.58), indicating that transmission in rural Kentucky might be ongoing.
