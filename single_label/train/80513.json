{"id":80513,"title":"Polymorphic patterns of the merozoite surface protein-3? in Korean isolates of Plasmodium vivax.","abstract":"The merozoite surface protein-3? of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-3?) is one of the candidate antigens for blood stage malaria vaccine development. The polymorphisms in PvMSP-3? have been reported in certain P. vivax isolates. However, the diversity of PvMSP-3? throughout its global distribution has not been well understood. In this study, the genetic diversity and the effects of natural selection in PvMSP-3? among P. vivax Korean isolates were analysed.Blood samples were collected from 95 patients with vivax malaria in Korea. The region flanking full-length PvMSP-3? was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into a TA cloning vector. The PvMSP-3? sequence of each isolate was determined and the polymorphic characteristics and effects of natural selection were analysed using the DNASTAR, MEGA4, and DnaSP programs.Five different subtypes of PvMSP-3? were identified based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions. Although a high level of sequence diversity was observed in the PvMSP-3? gene, the coiled-coil tertiary structure of the PvMSP-3? protein was well conserved in all of the sequences. The PvMSP-3? of Korean isolates is under natural selection. DNA polymerase slippage and intragenic recombination likely contributed to PvMSP-3? diversity in Korean P. vivax isolates.The PvMSP-3? of Korean P. vivax isolates displayed polymorphisms, with SNPs, insertions and deletions scattered throughout of the gene. These results of parasite heterogeneity are relevant to the development of a PvMSP-3? based vaccine against P. vivax and the implementation of malaria control programmes in Korea.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635878","annotations":[{"name":"Cloning
