{"id":81597,"title":"Role of Candida albicans-secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps) in severe early childhood caries.","abstract":"Candida albicans is strongly associated with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC). However, the roles of secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps), an important virulence factor of C. albicans, in the progress of S-ECC are not clear. In our study, the Saps activities were evaluated by the yeast nitrogen base-bovine serum albumi (YNB-BSA) agar plate method and by the MTT method with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the substrate. Genotypes of C. albicans and gene expression of Sap1-5 were evaluated. The relationships of Saps activities and genotypes with S-ECC were analyzed. The results showed that enzyme activities of Saps in the S-ECC group were significantly higher than those in the caries free (CF) group (p<0.05). Genotypes A, B and C were detected in the S-ECC group, and genotypes A and C were detected in the CF group. In the genotype A group, Saps activity in the S-ECC group was significantly different from that in the CF group (p<0.05). The gene expression level of Sap1 in the S-ECC group was significantly higher than that in the CF group (p=0.001), while Sap4 expression was significantly lower than that in the CF group (p=0.029). It can be concluded that Sap1-5 are the predominant proteinase genes expressed in C. albicans from dental biofilm and Sap1 may play an important role in the development of S-ECC.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933640","annotations":[{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Agar plate","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar_plate"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.808981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.716365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.454448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Plant sap","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_sap"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Bovine serum albumin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_serum_albumin"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
