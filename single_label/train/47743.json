{"id":47743,"title":"Genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer worldwide and results from the accumulation of mutations and epimutations in colonic mucosa cells ultimately leading to cell proliferation and metastasis. Unfortunately, CRC prognosis is still poor and the search of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is highly desired to prevent CRC-related deaths. The present article aims to summarize the most recent findings concerning the use of either genetic or epigenetic (mainly related to DNA methylation) biomarkers for CRC diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment. Recent large-scale DNA methylation studies suggest that CRC can be divided into several subtypes according to the frequency of DNA methylation and those of mutations in key CRC genes, and that this is reflected by different prognostic outcomes. Increasing evidence suggests that the analysis of DNA methylation in blood or fecal specimens could represent a valuable non-invasive diagnostic tool for CRC. Moreover, a broad spectrum of studies indicates that the inter-individual response to chemotherapeutic treatments depends on both epigenetic modifications and genetic mutations occurring in colorectal cancer cells, thereby opening the way for a personalized medicine. Overall, combining genetic and epigenetic data might represent the most promising tool for a proper diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approach.
