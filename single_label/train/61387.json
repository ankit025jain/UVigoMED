{"id":61387,"title":"[Chemotherapy].","abstract":"The progress of cancer chemotherapy has made a large contribution to the significant improvement of cure rate in patients with hematological malignancy including malignant lymphoma. Interpatient variability characterizes the disposition of many drugs. In the case of drugs with a wide therapeutic index, such variability is unlikely to affect either clinical efficacy or toxicity. With anticancer drugs, however, there is much less margin for error, due to their very narrow therapeutic index. Therefore, it is crucially important to understanding the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of each anticancer drug in order to give chemotherapy in safety. Overview of the pharmacological functions of anticancer agent using in malignant lymphoma is the subject of this chapter.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724404","annotations":[{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.824228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
