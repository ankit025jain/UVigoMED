{"id":28601,"title":"Illegal drugs in Grenada: arrests and drug treatment from 2001-2009.","abstract":"Illegal drug use and abuse has increased in the Caribbean since the 1990s. In Grenada, statistical indicators such as admission rates to treatment facilities and drug arrests have provided evidence for the increased rates of illegal drug use and abuse. This study reviewed these statistical indicators and explored drug treatment options in Grenada from 2001 to 2009.A search of statistical records from the Drug Control Secretariat and the Grenada Drug Information Network/National Observatory on Drugs (GRENDIN/NOD) was performed. Literature review of relevant articles from search engines was used to support findings. Additionally, semi-structured interviews of key stakeholders from government and health agencies involved in drug prevention in Grenada were conducted to obtain information on recent developments surrounding drug arrests and treatments in Grenada.From 2001 to 2009, there were a 118% and a 23% increase in the arrest rate for males and females,respectively. There was also an increase in demand for drug treatment at the sole drug treatment facility.Preventive measures in schools and several forms of media programmes have raised awareness. However,drug use/abuse/activities still persist at a significant rate. Programmes that target improvement of treatment facilities and increased inter-agency collaboration may be successful in enhancing drug arrests and treatments.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831897","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.526059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.261748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Caribbean","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.138729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Web search engine","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Grenada","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"Observatory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"}]}
