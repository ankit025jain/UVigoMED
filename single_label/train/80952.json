{"id":80952,"title":"[Investigation on status of Oncomelania hupensis in schistosomiasis transmission-interrupted areas of Huangshan City].","abstract":"To explore a new monitoring method for schistosomiasis transmission interrupted areas, so as to evaluate the monitoring results in counties (districts) to improve the quality.Specialized technicians were selected as survey teams to investigate the status of Oncomelania hupensis snails with the random sampling method combined with environmental sampling method every year from 1997 to 2013.From 1997 to 2013, 118 villages of 38 townships of 21 counties were investigated for the snail status, and there were 18 environments with snails in 10 townships of 7 counties. The snail area was 10.91 hm2.There are still small snail areas. Therefore, the snail monitoring should still be strengthened by specialized technicians.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490410","annotations":[{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Civil township","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township"},{"name":"Huangshan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Huangshan City","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan_City"},{"name":"Random sampling","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sampling"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Technician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technician"},{"name":"Specialized Bicycle Components","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_Bicycle_Components"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"List of counties in New Jersey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_New_Jersey"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"}]}
