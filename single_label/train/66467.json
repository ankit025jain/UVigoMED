{"id":66467,"title":"Direct aperture optimization using an inverse form of back-projection.","abstract":"Direct aperture optimization (DAO) has been used to produce high dosimetric quality intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans with fast treatment delivery by directly modeling the multileaf collimator segment shapes and weights. To improve plan quality and reduce treatment time for our in-house treatment planning system, we implemented a new DAO approach without using a global objective function (GFO). An index concept is introduced as an inverse form of back-projection used in the CT multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART). The index, introduced for IMRT optimization in this work, is analogous to the multiplicand in MART. The index is defined as the ratio of the optima over the current. It is assigned to each voxel and beamlet to optimize the fluence map. The indices for beamlets and segments are used to optimize multileaf collimator (MLC) segment shapes and segment weights, respectively. Preliminary data show that without sacrificing dosimetric quality, the implementation of the DAO reduced average IMRT treatment time from 13 min to 8 min for the prostate, and from 15 min to 9 min for the head and neck using our in-house treatment planning system PlanUNC. The DAO approach has also shown promise in optimizing rotational IMRT with burst mode in a head and neck test case.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710439","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.620004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.607696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Multiplication","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Aperture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"},{"name":"Voxel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel"},{"name":"Collimator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimator"},{"name":"Fluence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluence"},{"name":"Algebraic Reconstruction Technique","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_Reconstruction_Technique"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Multileaf collimator","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multileaf_collimator"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Planning permission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_permission"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Abstract algebra","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra"},{"name":"Line segment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment"},{"name":"Test case","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Index (computer science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Upper ontology (information science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology_(information_science)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
