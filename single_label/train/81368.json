{"id":81368,"title":"Surgical treatment of class II malocclusion in the orthodontic boundaries: a case report.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to report a clinical case of treatment of Class II division I malocclusion with facial aesthetic impairment, whose therapeutic approach comprised the association of orthodontic treatment with orthognathic surgery. The treatment for the present case consisted of decompensation oflower incisors and extraction oftwo lower premolars, in order to obtain horizontal discrepancy allowing the surgery for mandibular advancement. At the end of treatment, we could clinically observe a Class I molar/canine relationship, normal overbite and overjet, presence of lip seal, type I facial profile with considerable aesthetic improvement. We can conclude that the ortho-surgical treatment is a therapeutic alternative providing the best prognosis in terms of aesthetic correction in patients with unpleasant facial profile.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109062","annotations":[{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.749269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.484947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.231061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.109809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Radial shaft seal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_shaft_seal"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Pinniped","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Division (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Myosin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Division I (NCAA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
