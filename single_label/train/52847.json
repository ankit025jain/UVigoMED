{"id":52847,"title":"Obesity: the 'huge' problem in cardiovascular diseases.","abstract":"Obesity is an epidemic in the United States. It is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and associated with reduced life expectancy. The adverse effects are related to direct impact of obesity on cardiovascular system and indirectly through its influence on risk factors. Excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the myocardium leads to structural and functional alteration. In addition, numerous hormones secreted by adipose tissue create pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic state. This predisposes to coronary heart disease, heart failure, and sudden death. Even those with normal weight but excessive body fat are at risk. Weight reduction and exercise are the main therapeutic options.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564002","annotations":[{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.782514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.766547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.597453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.555396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.309438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.218851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.173265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"}]}
