{"id":23958,"title":"Fusobacterium spondylodiscitis: case report and literature review.","abstract":"Fusobacteria are obligate anaerobic bacilli residing in the oral cavity, female genital tract, and intestine. These pathogens are typical components of head, neck, and abdominal abscesses due to contiguous spread from adjacent mucosal surfaces. They are unusual etiologies, however, of bone and joint infections, particularly outside the cranial region. We report an unusual case of hematogenous lumbar spondylodiscitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum of suspected odontogenic origin.
