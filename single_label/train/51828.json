{"id":51828,"title":"Low mood and response to Levothyroxine treatment in Indian patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.","abstract":"There is considerable controversy regarding the association of subclinical hypothyrodism (SCH) and depression. We studied the association of SCH with low mood and also investigated the effects of L-thyroxine (LT4) therapy on improvement of symptoms.Three hundred patients with SCH and 300 age and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. Serum levels of TSH, FT3, FT4 were measured by chemi-illuminescence. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to evaluate baseline depression in all participants and subsequently, in 133 patients who had undergone LT4 therapy for 2 months.The HAM-D scores were significantly higher for cases (10.0±4.7) as compared to controls (2.4±1.5). A positive correlation (r(2)=0.87, p=0.00) was found, between the Hamilton scores and serum TSH levels. No such association was seen between serum FT3, FT4 levels and HAM-D scores. Levothyroxine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in TSH levels and Hamilton scores.SCH is associated with low mood and there is a positive correlation between serum TSH levels and HAM-D scores. The administration of Levothyroxine therapy is associated with significant improvement in HAM-D scores. This underlines the importance of thyroid screening in cases of low mood and also asserts the role of Levothyroxine therapy.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655635","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Rating_Scale_for_Depression"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.766691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.679966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.677154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.493226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Levothyroxine","weight":0.394312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.250134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Lieutenant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of Ubuntu releases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"SCH (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCH_(band)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
