{"id":53585,"title":"Exercise effects on postprandial glycemia, mood, and sympathovagal balance in type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"To compare the impact of walking with a recreational activity on postprandial glycemia, heart rate variability, and mood state following the dinner meal.Participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) participated in 3 trials on different days in random order after ingestion of a standardized dinner meal (300 ± 6 kcals).University clinical testing laboratory.Twelve participants (9 female, 3 male; 58.7 ± 2.4 years) with uncomplicated T2D not taking insulin or beta-blocker medications.Thirty minutes of self-paced walking on a treadmill (TM), 30 minutes of table tennis played continuously against the iPong robot (TT), and 30 minutes of rest (CON) undertaken 30 minutes after the start of ingestion of the same dinner meal on three occasions within a week.Blood glucose was measured at 30-minute intervals through 180 minutes starting immediately prior to the dinner meal. Profile of Mood States was completed before and immediately following exercise or rest. Sympathovagal balance (heart rate variability) was measured prior to eating and 30 minutes after trial completion.Compared with TT or CON, TM resulted in significantly lower postprandial blood glucose (P < .05), as well as a greater quantity of physical activity than TT (+72%) or rest (+91%; P < .01). Mean heart rate during TM was significantly greater than during TT (+25.9 beats per minute; P < .01). However, neither mood state nor HRV were significantly different among trials.Thirty minutes of self-paced walking following the dinner meal may be more effective at lowering postprandial glycemia in T2D than a similar duration of table tennis played continuously against a robot.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508328","annotations":[{"name":"Beta blocker","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.77432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.65163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.616438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.405451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Tennis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis"},{"name":"Treadmill","weight":0.334902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Heart rate variability","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability"},{"name":"Table tennis","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.0779696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Beats per minute","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_per_minute"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Dinner","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"}]}
