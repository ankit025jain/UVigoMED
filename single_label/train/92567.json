{"id":92567,"title":"Efficacy of periarticular multimodal drug injection after medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy: a randomized, controlled study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of periarticular multimodal drug injection after medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy regarding the postoperative pain level.From January 2011 to January 2012, 70 patients underwent medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy. Thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive no injection (group I), and 35 patients were assigned to receive periarticular multimodal drug injection (group II). These 2 groups were compared regarding the postoperative pain level, frequency of additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug injections, total amount of patient-controlled analgesia, and number of times that patients pushed the patient-controlled analgesia button at each time interval. Statistical results were based on multivariate analysis of variance and repeated-measures analyses.Multivariate analysis of variance of mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores over the 2-week postoperative period showed statistical significance (P < .001). Repeated-measures analysis yielded a statistically significant difference (P = .001) for the time-by-treatment interaction, showing a clear periarticular multimodal drug injection benefit over time based on VAS scores. In addition, the mean number of times that patients pushed the patient-controlled analgesia button differed significantly between groups over time (P = .01). The VAS scores, frequency of additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug injections, mean number of times that patients pushed the patient-controlled analgesia button, and mean total amount of fentanyl consumption differed significantly within each group over time (P < .001 for all variables). However, the frequency of additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug injections and mean total amount of fentanyl consumption did not differ significantly between groups over time (P = .822, P = .529, and P = .282). Opioid- and injection-related complications were not found.This prospective randomized study shows that intraoperative periarticular multimodal drug injections in patients undergoing medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy for unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee could result in significant reductions in VAS scores at 2 weeks postoperatively.Level I, high-quality randomized controlled trial with statistically significant differences.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Musculoskeletal
