{"id":52218,"title":"CXCL1/CXCL8 (GRO?/IL-8) in human diabetic ketoacidosis plasma facilitates leukocyte recruitment to cerebrovascular endothelium in vitro.","abstract":"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children is associated with intracranial vascular complications, possibly due to leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Our aim was to determine whether DKA-induced inflammation promoted leukocyte adhesion to activated human cerebrovascular endothelium. Plasma was obtained from children with type 1 diabetes either in acute DKA or in an insulin-controlled state (CON). Plasma concentrations of 21 inflammatory analytes were compared between groups. DKA was associated with altered circulating levels of ?CXCL1 (GRO?), ?CXCL8 (IL-8), ?IL-6, ?IFN?2, and ?CXCL10 (IP-10) compared with CON. These plasma analyte measurements were then used to create physiologically relevant cytokine mixtures (CM). Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) were stimulated with either plasma (DKA-P or CON-P) or CM (DKA-CM or CON-CM) and assessed for polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion. Stimulation of hCMEC/D3 with DKA-P or DKA-CM increased PMN adhesion to hCMEC/D3 under \"flow\" conditions. PMN adhesion to hCMEC/D3 was suppressed with neutralizing antibodies to CXCL1/CXCL8 or their hCMEC/D3 receptors CXCR1/CXCR2. DKA-P, but not DKA-CM, initiated oxidative stress in hCMEC/D3. Expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were unaltered on hCMEC/D3 by either DKA-P or DKA-CM. In summary, DKA elicits inflammation in children associated with changes in circulating cytokines/chemokines. Increased CXCL1/CXCL8 instigated PMN adhesion to hCMEC/D3, possibly contributing to DKA-associated intracranial vascular complications.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619879","annotations":[{"name":"VCAM-1","weight":0.90816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAM-1"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.869711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.831407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Diabetic ketoacidosis","weight":0.804605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.769836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.716916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.632907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.630304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.534801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.51131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.428571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"CXCL1","weight":0.311536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL1"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.23879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"CXC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"}]}
