{"id":27543,"title":"Estimation of the possible economic effects of a sequential testing strategy with NT-proBNP before echocardiography in primary care.","abstract":"The object of the study was to estimate the possible economic effects of a sequential testing strategy with NT-proBNP from a primary care payer perspective.The study data were collected from primary care physicians in the County of Uppland from 2005 through 2012. Two different cut-off levels were used for negative NT-proBNP in the rule-out test: 300 and 400 pg/mL. The cost-effectiveness of the testing strategy was estimated through the short-term cost avoidance and reduction in demand for echocardiographies.The female patients were slightly older than the males. Based on the data from 2012, the estimated costs for NT-proBNP tests and echocardiographies per county were reduced by EUR 300000/100000 inhabitants with the 300 pg/mL cut-off and EUR 350000/100000 inhabitants with the 400 pg/mL.The use of NT-proBNP as a rule-out test in a sequential testing strategy reduced the cost for diagnostic work-up of primary care patients with suspected heart failure.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016690","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Euro","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Uppland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppland"},{"name":"Sequential analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Tax avoidance and tax evasion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance_and_tax_evasion"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
