{"id":43293,"title":"Identification of serum cytokine profiles associated with HBeAg seroconversion following antiviral treatment interruption.","abstract":"The major shortcoming of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is the frequent requirement for indefinite therapy. Withdrawal of treatment can result in viral rebound with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare leading to hepatic decompensation, while in others this can lead to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion. The aim of the study was to identify host immune profiles associated with these different outcomes. Eighteen HBeAg(+) patients, enrolled on a phase III trial with the nucleoside analogue adefovir dipivoxil, were followed for up to 128 weeks. For the first 48 weeks, all patients received continuous therapy. Subsequently, patients experienced cycles of treatment interruptions due to random drug/placebo misallocations. Host immune profiles were characterized by measuring a panel of serum cytokines before, during, and after each cycle of treatment withdrawal. Virus-specific T-cell responses were also determined at these time points in a subset of patients to elucidate the mechanisms utilized to control hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication post-treatment. Significantly, elevated levels of IFN-?, IP-10, and IL-2 on-treatment were associated with HBeAg seroconversion after treatment withdrawal. In these patients, treatment interruption induced further increases in serum IFN-? levels and marked increases in virus-specific T-cells producing IFN-?, but minimal alterations in viremia and ALT. In HBeAg(+) patients with low on-treatment levels of serum IFN-?, the interruption of therapy induced significant elevations in HBV-DNA, ALT, IP-10, and increases in virus-specific T-cells producing IL-10. Evaluating on-treatment serum cytokines in concert with virologic and clinical parameters may help to identify CHB patients who can successfully discontinue nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797262","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Adefovir","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adefovir"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.856294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Nucleoside analogue","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_analogue"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.70516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.595724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.533312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.331851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.158058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Rebound effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"}]}
