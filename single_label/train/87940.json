{"id":87940,"title":"Anterior hip dislocation 5 months after hip arthroscopy.","abstract":"Hip dislocation subsequent to hip arthroscopy is a rare complication. We report on a case of low-energy anterior hip dislocation that occurred 5 months after hip arthroscopy, a period notably longer than any previously reported event. The patient was a track and field athlete who presented and received treatment for a labral tear and cam lesion. The athlete then dislocated her hip postoperatively during competitive jumping, a motion that requires significant hip flexion and extension. The most likely cause of the anterior dislocation was failure to close the capsule at the completion of surgery, lending credibility to recent trends in the literature suggesting routine capsular closure. We believe that a partial psoas release also contributed to dynamic hip instability because of increased femoral anteversion in this patient. This case suggests that hip capsule closure should be considered at the completion of every procedure and that a psoas release should be avoided in patients with significant anteversion. Furthermore, the biomechanics of competitive jumping may make these athletes more prone to dislocation and require more conservative return-to-sport recommendations.
