{"id":56841,"title":"Sub-Tenon block does not provide superior postoperative analgesia vs intravenous fentanyl in pediatric squint surgery.","abstract":"We evaluated the efficacy of sub-Tenon block in decreasing perioperative pain, incidence of intraoperative oculocardiac reflex (OCR), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in pediatric squint surgery.A total of 67 children age 2-12 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 1 and 2, were randomized to receive either sub-Tenon block (ST) in the operative eye or 2 mcg/kg of intravenous fentanyl (F) for squint surgery after induction of general anesthesia in this double-blind study. Postoperative pain was measured by either modified Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) or Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Pain in the postoperative period (up to 2 hours) was measured as the primary endpoint. Other parameters measured in the groups were intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative modified CHEOPS or VAS at shifting, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery, incidence of intraoperative OCR, and PONV at shifting, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery.There was no statistical difference in the postoperative pain scores in the recovery room up to 2 hours after surgery. The VAS and CHEOPS scores were not different in the groups up to 24 hours after surgery. The incidence of OCR was significantly higher in group F than group ST. The incidence of PONV was significantly higher in group F than group ST at 30 minutes and 1 hour after the surgery (41%, 47% vs 19%, 9%, respectively, p<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference in intraoperative hemodynamics and PONV scores after 2 hours in the postanesthesia care unit.Use of sub-Tenon block does not decrease the incidence of postoperative pain significantly in children undergoing squint surgery. However, it leads to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of intraoperative OCR and PONV in the early recovery period in these patients.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619855","annotations":[{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Postoperative nausea and vomiting","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Post-anesthesia care unit","weight":0.629339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-anesthesia_care_unit"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.526802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.426713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.362499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.279473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Pain scale","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_scale"},{"name":"Optical character recognition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Eastern world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_world"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
