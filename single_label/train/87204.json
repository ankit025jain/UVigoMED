{"id":87204,"title":"Association between childhood physical abuse, unprotected receptive anal intercourse and HIV infection among young men who have sex with men in Vancouver, Canada.","abstract":"The association between childhood sexual abuse and HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) is well established. However, no studies have examined the potential impact of other forms of childhood maltreatment on HIV incidence in this population.We explored the impact of child physical abuse (CPA) on HIV seroconversion in a cohort of gay/bisexual men aged 15 to 30 in Vancouver, Canada. Cox proportional hazard models were used, controlling for confounders.Among 287 participants, 211 (73.5%) reported experiencing CPA before the age of 17, and 42 (14.6%) reporting URAI in the past year. After a median of 6.6 years follow-up, 16 (5.8%) participants HIV-seroconverted. In multivariate analysis, CPA was significantly associated with HIV seroconversion (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]?=?4.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.65-14.48), after controlling for potential confounders.Our study uncovered a link between childhood physical violence and HIV incidence. Results highlight an urgent need for screening of young gay and bisexual men for histories of violence, and social and structural supports to prevent HIV transmission in this population.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963804","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.930781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Bisexuality","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.786525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"LGBT","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.706908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Gay","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Child sexual abuse","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.522593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.333138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Vancouver","weight":0.274139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.223482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.207664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Physical abuse","weight":0.203715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Freedom of association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
