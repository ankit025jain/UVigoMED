{"id":52424,"title":"Differential expression of secretoglobins in normal ovary and in ovarian carcinoma--overexpression of mammaglobin-1 is linked to tumor progression.","abstract":"Secretoglobins (SCGB), such as mammaglobin 1 (MGB1, SCGB2A2), mammaglobin 2 (MGB2, SCGB2A1) and lipophilin B (LIPB, SCGB1D2), have been related to carcinogenesis. We profiled expression of MGB1, MGB2 and LIPB in human tissues and ovarian carcinoma and explored the impact of SCGB overexpression on cell proliferation. MGB1, MGB2 and LIPB mRNA are expressed at variable levels in most human tissues and we observed significant bilateral correlations between the different secretoglobins. Concerted overexpression of MGB1 and LIPB resulted in significant increase in cell proliferation. In clinical specimens of ovarian carcinoma we measured elevated concentrations of secretoglobin mRNA and for MGB1 this up-regulation was confirmed on the protein level. Overexpression of MGB1 positively correlated with the FIGO stage, the tumor grade and the mitotic index suggesting a patho-physiological role of the protein. Our data indicate that MGB1, MGB2 and LIPB mRNAs are expressed at low levels in human tissues but basal expression is upregulated in ovarian cancer. The in vivo correlation between nuclear MGB1 localization and the mitotic rate in ovarian cancer as well as the increased cell proliferation induced by secretoglobin overexpression in ovarian cancer cell lines suggest a pathophysiological role of these proteins in ovarian cancer.
