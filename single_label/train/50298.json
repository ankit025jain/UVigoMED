{"id":50298,"title":"A histological and immunohistochemical study of beta cells in streptozotocin diabetic rats treated with caffeine.","abstract":"In this study, the histological, immunohistochemical, morphometric, and biochemical changes to pancreatic beta-cells in STZ-induced diabetes were evaluated in rats treated with different doses of caffeine. Fifty adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups: the nondiabetic control group, the diabetic untreated group, and three diabetic groups treated with different doses of caffeine (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day). Blood glucose and serum insulin levels were measured. The pancreata were collected and processed into paraffin sections. They were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson trichrome stains. The insulin expression in beta-cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Morphometrically, the percentage area of anti-insulin antibody reaction, the percentage of beta-cells per total islet cell number, and the average area of the islets were determined. STZ-induced degenerative changes in beta-cells led to decreases in the number of functioning beta-cells and insulin immunoreactivity and to increases in the number of collagen fibers in the islets. In STZ-treated rats, caffeine significantly decreased blood glucose concentration while increasing blood insulin levels at the highest applied dose. It also induced a significant increase in the number of immunoreactive beta-cells. In conclusion, caffeine may have a protective role in the biochemical and microscopic changes in pancreatic beta-cells in diabetes induced in rats through STZ administration.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802960","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Caffeine","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Beta cell","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_cell"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.683114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.663079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.604126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.374237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.317046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.31349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.234615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0885189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"H&E stain","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&E_stain"}]}
