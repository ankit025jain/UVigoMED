{"id":72883,"title":"Gremlins sabotage the mechanisms of cancer stem cell differentiation.","abstract":"BMP is highly expressed in glioblastoma and promotes differentiation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently, Yan and colleagues found the explanation to this apparent paradox by showing that the antagonist of BMP, Gremlin1, is secreted by CSCs to protect them against the BMP-induced differentiation.
