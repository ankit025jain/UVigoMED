{"id":83178,"title":"[Clinical characteristics of primary biliary cirrhosis complicating Sjögren syndrome].","abstract":"To explore the clinical characteristics of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with Sjögren syndrome (SS) so as to seek diagnostic rationales.Sixty-four PBC patients, 57 SS patients and 93 PBC with SS patients were recruited from Peking Union College Hospital between 2006 and 2009. And their clinical, laboratory and pathological data were analyzed.The patients of PBC with SS (53 ± 10) years were older than those of PBC (50 ± 11) years (P < 0.05) or SS (48 ± 14) years (P < 0.05) ; Comparing PBC with SS and SS, fever was more in SS (P < 0.05) ;compare with PBC, the positive rates of anti-centromere antibody (ACA) (P < 0.05) and anti-SSA antibody (P < 0.05) increased obviously in PBC with SS. Comparing with SS, the positive rate of anti-SSA antibody (P < 0.05) and anti-SSB antibody (P < 0.05) were apparently increased obviously in PBC with SS.PBC with SS is a special subgroup with the characteristic both PBC and SS. But it can not differentiate from PBC or SS, Anti-SSA antibody and ACA are helpful for diagnosis of PBC with SS.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423911","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.531798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.521606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.433015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.416382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.3217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Primary biliary cirrhosis","weight":0.21859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_biliary_cirrhosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Union College","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_College"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
