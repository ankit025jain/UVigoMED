{"id":68251,"title":"Beneficial effect of LDL-apheresis in refractory nephrotic syndrome.","abstract":"LDL-apheresis is a method to correct dyslipidemia rapidly. It is expected to alleviate the tissue toxicity of persistent dyslipidemia in not only primary, but also in secondary dyslipidemia associated with refractory nephrotic syndrome, and to have a protective effect against glomerular and tubular injury as expected in atherosclerosis. In addition, the effectiveness of LDL-apheresis to promote the remission of nephrotic syndrome has been recognized. In Japan, LDL-A to control hyperlipidemia in patients with refractory nephrotic syndrome associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is covered by national health insurance. Here, the hypothetical mechanism behind its effect and the evidence for its effectiveness over a long period are reviewed.
