{"id":6929,"title":"[Genotypes and serotypes of avian infectious bronchitis viruses isolated during 2009-2011 in Guangxi, China].","abstract":"In order to investigate the prevalence and track genetic and antigenic evolutions of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and their prevalence in Guangxi, China since 1985, gene amplification and sequencing and virus neutralization (VN) test on chicken embryo tracheal organ cultures were used in genotyping and serotyping of 28 IBV isolates during 2009-2011 in Guangxi. The results of N gene sequencing and comparison showed that the 28 isolates and reference strains were classified into three groups, and most isolates belonged to group Ill, while the isolates in 1985-2008 belonged to groups IV and II. The data of VN test indicated that the 28 isolates belonged to 6 serotypes; among them, 71. 4% belonged to serotypes 1, 2, and 3, and 11 (39.3%) shared the same serotype with the current vaccine strains. Given the data of our previous study, it is found that prevalent serotypes and their proportions varied in different areas of Guangxi and during different periods. These data lay a good foundation for developing an oil-emulsified inactivated polyvalent vaccine containing local dominant serotypes for the effective prevention and control of infectious bronchitis.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923170","annotations":[{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.850728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.755083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Bronchitis","weight":0.741207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.739266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.688135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.539248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.482862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.440536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.391098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.219056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Guangxi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
