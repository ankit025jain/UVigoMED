{"id":87080,"title":"Detailed study of the interaction between human herpesvirus 6B glycoprotein complex and its cellular receptor, human CD134.","abstract":"Recently, we identified a novel receptor, CD134, which interacts with the human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) glycoprotein (g)H/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex and plays a key role in the entry of HHV-6B into target cells. However, details of the interaction between the HHV-6B gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex and CD134 were unknown. In this study, we identified a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), CDR2, of CD134 that is critical for binding to the HHV-6B glycoprotein complex and HHV-6B infection. Furthermore, we found that the expression of HHV-6B gQ1 and gQ2 subunits was sufficient for CD134 binding, which is different from the binding of human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) to its receptor, CD46. Finally, we identified a region in gQ1 critical for HHV-6B gQ1 function. These results contribute much to our understanding of the interaction between this ligand and receptor.We identified the domain in HHV-6B entry receptor CD134 and the components in the HHV-6B gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex required for ligand-receptor binding during HHV-6B infection. Furthermore, we identified domains in gQ1 proteins of HHV-6A and -6B and a key amino acid residue in HHV-6B gQ1 required for its function. These data should be the basis for further investigation of ligand-receptor interaction in the study of HHV-6A and -6B.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008928","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.624473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.534572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.390259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.287769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Complementarity determining region","weight":0.207002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_determining_region"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.194532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Human herpesvirus 6","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_herpesvirus_6"},{"name":"CD134","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD134"},{"name":"CD46","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD46"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Common rail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_rail"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Higher heating value","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_heating_value"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"6B (Fringe)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6B_(Fringe)"}]}
