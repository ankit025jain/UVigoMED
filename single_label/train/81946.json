{"id":81946,"title":"Atherogenic cholesterol-rich diet and periodontal disease.","abstract":"This study investigated the effect of an atherogenic cholesterol-rich diet (AT) on the alveolar bone loss in rats with ligature-induced experimental periodontitis (EP).Female Wistar adult rats were assigned either a control (Co) or an AT diet fed for 9 weeks. The AT diet was high in saturated fat, cholesterol and energy. At week 2, animals were subjected to a unilateral ligature (L) around the left first molar (Co+L and AT+L). The contra lateral first right molar (not ligated) of both groups (Co and AT) were used as untreated controls. At week 9, blood was drawn, rats were euthanized, hemi-mandibles removed and stained digital photographs (buccal and lingual surfaces) and radiographs were obtained for quantification of alveolar bone loss (ABL). The ABL was determined by distance and area methods (mm(2)) and X-rays were used for periodontal bone support (PBS), (%).Rats in the AT group exhibited a 17% increase in energy intake, gained significant body weight and showed the highest serum total-cholesterol (T-C) and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p<0.001). The amount of lost periodontal bone was the greatest in AT+L rats. AT feedings significantly increased the buccal area and distance of bone loss when compared with the unligated-teeth (p<0.001). The rats in the AT+L group also achieved the lowest percentage of PBS (p<0.001). The AT and Co+L rats showed similar PBS. This method more clearly elucidated the effect of the cholesterol-rich AT, with and without the influence of molar ligature, compared to the morphometric analysis.The alveolar bone loss of EP was magnified by ingestion of an atherogenic diet high in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769219","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.814499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.686001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.632144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.507719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.471201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.329115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.2313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.202265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.156188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"}]}
