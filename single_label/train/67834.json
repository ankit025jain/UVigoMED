{"id":67834,"title":"Prostate biopsy for the interventional radiologist.","abstract":"Prostate biopsies are usually performed by urologists in the office setting using transrectal ultrasound (US) guidance. The current standard of care involves obtaining 10-14 cores from different anatomic sections. Biopsies are usually not directed into a specific lesion because most prostate cancers are not visible on transrectal US. Color Doppler, US contrast agents, elastography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and MR imaging/US fusion are proposed as imaging methods to guide prostate biopsies. Prostate MR imaging and fusion biopsy create opportunities for diagnostic and interventional radiologists to play an increasingly important role in the screening, evaluation, diagnosis, targeted biopsy, surveillance, and focal therapy of patients with prostate cancer.
