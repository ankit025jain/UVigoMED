{"id":22135,"title":"Detection of potential microbial antigens by immuno-PCR (PCR-amplified immunoassay).","abstract":"Immuno-PCR (PCR-amplified immunoassay; I-PCR) is a novel ultrasensitive method combining the versatility of ELISA with the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification of PCR. The enormous exponential amplification power of PCR in an I-PCR assay leads to at least a 10(2)-10(4)-fold increase in sensitivity compared with an analogous ELISA. I-PCR has been used to detect many biological molecules such as proto-oncogenes, toxins, cytokines, hormones, and biomarkers for autoimmune and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as microbial antigens and antibodies, and it can be adapted as a novel diagnostic tool for various infectious and non-infectious diseases. Quantitative real-time I-PCR has the potential to become the most analytically sensitive method for the detection of proteins. The sensitivity and specificity of a real-time I-PCR assay can be enhanced further with the use of magnetic beads and nanoparticles. This review is primarily focused on the detection of potential viral, bacterial and parasitic antigens by I-PCR assay, thus enabling their application for immunological research and for early diagnosis of infectious diseases.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568881","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.862818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.801156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biomolecule","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.710495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.699101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.655358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.535822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.504766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.218851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.205405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
