{"id":38800,"title":"The role of cardiac catheterisation in patients with tetralogy of Fallot.","abstract":"Cardiac catheterisation plays an important role in the management of patients with tetralogy of Fallot. There are a number of palliative transcatheter interventions that can be performed in the neonatal period to allow for improved oxygen saturations and interval growth of the pulmonary arteries until corrective surgery is performed. Most patients develop branch pulmonary artery stenosis, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, pulmonary insufficiency, or significant residual left-to-right shunts during long-term follow-up after corrective surgery. Transcatheter interventions can be performed to treat many of these issues, often eliminating or delaying the need for subsequent surgery. The indications for cardiac catheterisation and the specifics for various interventional procedures for patients with tetralogy of Fallot are reviewed in this manuscript.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401262","annotations":[{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.856973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.84351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Cardiac catheterization","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.489359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"}]}
