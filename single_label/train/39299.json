{"id":39299,"title":"[Effect of acupuncture intervention on gastrointestinal motility and liver pathological changes in cirrhotic rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of acupuncture intervention on gastrointestinal motility and liver pathologic changes in cirrhotic rats so as to reveal its underlying mechanisms in improving cirrhosis.Cirrhotic model was established by subcutaneous injection of CCL 4-olive oil (3-5 mL/kg), and intake of high fat diet mixed with 15% ethanol aqueous. Forty SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, acupuncture and medication groups (n = 10 in each group). For rats of the acupuncture group, EA was applied to bilateral \"Zusanli\" (ST 36), \"Sanyinjiao\" (SP 6) and \"Taichong\" (LR 3) for 15 min, once daily for 14 days. Rats of the medication group were treated by gavage of Domperidone liquid (100 mg/100 mL, 0.6 mL/100 g) once daily for 14 days. The food-intake state, propulsive rate of small intestine, liver index, portal vein diameter were recorded or measured, and the liver pathological changes were observed under microscope after H. E. and reticular fibers staining.In the model group, the food-intake amount and propulsive rate of small intestine were significantly reduced (P < 0.05), the liver index and portal vein diameter were considerably increased (P < 0.05) when compared with those of the control group. While in comparison with the model group, the food-intake amount and propulsive rate of the small intestine were apparently increased in both acupuncture and medication groups (P < 0.05), while the liver index and portal vein diameter were obviously down-regulated in the acupuncture group (P < 0.05), not in the medication group (P > 0.05). H.E. and reticular fibers stain showed that CCL 4-induced changes of the liver tissue such as cirrhosis, fibroplasias, pseudo-lobulation, fibroplasias, diffusive inflammatory cell infiltration, etc. were relatively milder in the acupuncture group, rather than in the medication group.Electroacupuncture therapy has a positive effect in improving gastrointestinal motility and may be favorable to relieve hepatic pathological changes in liver cirrhosis rats.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Digestive System
