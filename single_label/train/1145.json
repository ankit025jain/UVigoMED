{"id":1145,"title":"Real-time use of instantaneous wave-free ratio: results of the ADVISE in-practice: an international, multicenter evaluation of instantaneous wave-free ratio in clinical practice.","abstract":"To evaluate the first experience of real-time instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) measurement by clinicians.The iFR is a new vasodilator-free index of coronary stenosis severity, calculated as a trans-lesion pressure ratio during a specific period of baseline diastole, when distal resistance is lowest and stable. Because all previous studies have calculated iFR offline, the feasibility of real-time iFR measurement has never been assessed.Three hundred ninety-two stenoses with angiographically intermediate stenoses were included in this multicenter international analysis. Instantaneous wave-free ratio and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were performed in real time on commercially available consoles. The classification agreement of coronary stenoses between iFR and FFR was calculated.Instantaneous wave-free ratio and FFR maintain a close level of diagnostic agreement when both are measured by clinicians in real time (for a clinical 0.80 FFR cutoff: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC(AUC)] 0.87, classification match 80%, and optimal iFR cutoff 0.90; for a ischemic 0.75 FFR cutoff: iFR ROC(AUC) 0.90, classification match 88%, and optimal iFR cutoff 0.85; if the FFR 0.75-0.80 gray zone is accounted for: ROC(AUC) 0.93, classification match 92%). When iFR and FFR are evaluated together in a hybrid decision-making strategy, 61% of the population is spared from vasodilator while maintaining a 94% overall agreement with FFR lesion classification.When measured in real time, iFR maintains the close relationship to FFR reported in offline studies. These findings confirm the feasibility and reliability of real-time iFR calculation by clinicians.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25440803","annotations":[{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.785842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.304175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0344458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"ADVISE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADVISE"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Overall pressure ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overall_pressure_ratio"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Video game console","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"}]}
