{"id":2116,"title":"Laparoscopy with left chest collis gastroplasty: a simplified technique for shortened esophagus.","abstract":"Axial shortening of the esophagus is caused by repetitive esophageal injury from gastroesophageal reflux disease resulting in esophagitis, submucosal fibrosis, and esophageal dysmotility. A short esophagus (<2 cm of intraabdominal length after type II mediastinal dissection) is encountered in 20% to 63% of patients undergoing paraesophageal hernia repair. An esophageal lengthening procedure can be a useful adjunct to fundoplication to reduce the 50% recurrence rate reported at 5 years. We describe a simplified Collis gastroplasty technique that negates the need for wedge fundectomy, potentially saving operating room time and cost, while hypothetically reducing morbidity.
