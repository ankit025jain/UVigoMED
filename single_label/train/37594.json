{"id":37594,"title":"Case of congenital aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva with common arterial trunk.","abstract":"We describe an unusual case of a patient with common arterial trunk and interrupted aortic arch, complicated byÂ congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva, who underwent successful repair. To our knowledge, no such case has been reported in the English literature. The combination of common arterial trunk and congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva may yield insights into the morphogenesis of congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva.
