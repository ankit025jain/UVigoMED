{"id":65970,"title":"[The algorithms of evaluation of economic effectiveness of laboratory technologies].","abstract":"The article considers several practical situations requiring estimation of economic effectiveness. The protocols of estimation, costs and effectiveness accounting requirements of practical public health are proposed. The necessity of development of correct epidemiological model is demonstrated to estimate profit of innovations of diagnostic stage. The estimation \"costs-effectiveness\" is made for troponins at diagnostic of cardiac infarction and prostate-specific antigen under screening of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757868","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.585865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.56601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.514156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.271686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.202124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.147825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.108778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0215179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Profit (accounting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
