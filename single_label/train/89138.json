{"id":89138,"title":"Predicting arterial injuries after penetrating brain trauma based on scoring signs from emergency CT studies.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of individual radiologists in detection of vascular injury in patients after penetrating brain injury (PBI) based on head CT findings at admission. We retrospectively evaluated 54 PBI patients who underwent admission head CT and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), used here as a reference standard. Two readers reviewed the CT images to determine the presence or absence of the 29 CT variables of injury profile and quantified selected variables. Four experienced trauma radiologists and one neuroradiologist assigned their own specific scores for each CT variable, a high score indicative of a high probability of artery injury. A sixth set consisted of the average score obtained from the five sets, generated by five experts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each set to assess the diagnostic performance of an individual radiologist in predicting an underlying vascular injury. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was higher for CT scores obtained from the sixth set (average of five sets of scores) of variable rank score 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.88) and for the rest of the data sets, the value ranged from 0.70 (95% CI 0.56-0.84) to 0.74 (95% CI 0.6-0.88). In conclusion, radiologists may be able to recommend DSA with a fair accuracy rate in selected patients, deemed 'high-risk' for developing intracranial vascular injuries after PBI based on admission CT studies. A better approach needs to be developed to reduce the false positive rate to avoid unnecessary emergency DSA.
