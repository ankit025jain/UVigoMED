{"id":15029,"title":"Intercostal approach for right adrenalectomy in dogs.","abstract":"To describe an intercostal (IC) approach to the right adrenal (RA) gland in dogs.Cadaveric study and case series.Dogs with right adrenal (RA) tumors (n?=?11) and normal canine cadavers (6).Cadavers had an IC (n?=?3) or paracostal (3) approach to the RA. The relative spatial position of the RA to the incision was evaluated. Medical records (June 2007-December 2012) of dogs that had an IC approach to the RA were reviewed. Perioperative data were recorded and described.In cadavers, the RA was closer to the cranial aspect of the surgical incision after an IC approach compared with a paracostal approach. The IC approach for right adrenalectomy was successfully performed in 11 dogs (6 adrenocortical carcinomas, 4 pheochromocytomas, and 1 osteosarcoma) with a mean anesthesia duration of 242?minutes and mean surgical of 144?minutes. Dogs had vascular invasion into the phrenicoabdominal vein (n?=?11) and caudal vena cava (6). There were no significant intra- or postoperative complications. One dog was euthanatized intraoperatively. Median survival time for all dogs was 786 days.The IC approach for right adrenalectomy offers superior exposure of the RA compared with a paracostal approach.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392699","annotations":[{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.674063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.619871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.524108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.514156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.436629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.134162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Adrenalectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenalectomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"786","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/786"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Hymenotomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenotomy"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
