{"id":90587,"title":"[The outlook for the use of polymeric scaffolds in the reconstruction and the regeneration stimulation of traumatic brain injuries].","abstract":"Neurological disorders and injuries such as ischemic or haemorrhagic strokes or traumatic brain injuries result in the damage of cerebral parenchyma structures and in consequence, the loss of neurological functions. The current clinical strategies for the treatment of the brain nervous tissue disruptions are limited. The aforementioned methods can reduce the tissue degeneration or mitigate the subsequent symptoms, but do not alter the fact that many of the affected people are incapable of returning to the condition before the accident and they need long-lasting rehabilitation. Regenerative strategies based on the cell therapies and the use of polymeric scaffolds seem to be very promising for many patients. Polymer scaffolds may provide an opportunity to enhance the probability of cell therapy success by creating an artificial extracellular matrix which further facilitates cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and promotes integrity of transplanted as well as endogenous cells. This paper presents selected forms of the polymeric scaffolds, which have been tested for the restoration processes within brain tissue and their potential clinical applications of scaffolds in both the treatment of posttraumatic neuronal loss and the neurodegenerative disorders.
