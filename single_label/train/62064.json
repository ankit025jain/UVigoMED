{"id":62064,"title":"Diffuse interstitial lung disease as a first manifestation of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia: case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoid malignancy characterized by infiltration, mainly of the bone marrow and lymph nodes, by small mature lymphocytes showing plasmacytoid differentiation, associated with an IgM monoclonal band, and, in general, a low degree of aggressiveness. We present the first case reported in the Spanish literature of interstitial lung disease presenting as MW and we review the literature.
