{"id":86121,"title":"Complex sleep apnea associated with use of nasal expiratory positive airway (nEPAP) device.","abstract":"Complex sleep apnea syndrome (CompSAS) is characterized by predominant obstructive sleep disordered breathing with evolution of central disordered breathing following exposure to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. We report a case of CompSAS associated with use of a nasal expiratory positive airway (nEPAP, Provent) device. We therefore recommend obtaining objective sleep data to confirm treatment effectiveness of the nEPAP device for OSA prior to long-term prescription. Further research is warranted to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors associated with CompSAS.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812544","annotations":[{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.828557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.530041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.490737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.343985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.102947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0201095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
