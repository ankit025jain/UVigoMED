{"id":66700,"title":"Giant urinary bladder stone: incidental finding in (99m)Tc-DTPA renography.","abstract":"A 27-year-old woman presented with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections in infancy and urinary incontinence secondary to lipomyelomeningocele. At the age of 7, she underwent bladder augmentation enterocystoplasty, requiring intermittent catheterization without urinary tract infections until present. A Tc-DTPA renography was performed to evaluate renal function, in which an abnormal tracer distribution was seen in urinary bladder, and furthermore, a retrograde cystography shows a giant bladder stone.
