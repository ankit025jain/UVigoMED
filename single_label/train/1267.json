{"id":1267,"title":"[Plasty of the left atrium in the isolated mitral valve prosthesis implantation].","abstract":"Possibilities of the procedures conduction of the left atrium (LA) plasty in a mitral valve prosthesis (MVP) were studied. There were examined 553 patients, in whom surgical treatment in the clinic was conducted. In all the patients MVP was conducted for isolated mitral valve failure and dilatation of LA. In 371 patients (the main group) MVP and LA plasty were conducted, in 182 (control group)--LA was not corrected. Morphometric indices of left cardiac cameras, survival, stability of the operation good results in late terms have witnessed high efficiency of MVP with LA reduction in comparison with such in a control group. Late results of MVP in conjunction with LA reduction exceed such in a control group, witnessing expediency of the proposed methods of surgical treatment application.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417286","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.808981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Left atrium","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.52828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.410135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.338135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.235411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.062042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"553","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/553"},{"name":"371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Most Valuable Player","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Possibilities","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possibilities"}]}
