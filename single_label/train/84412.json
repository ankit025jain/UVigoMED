{"id":84412,"title":"Key mutations in the cylindrical inclusion involved in lettuce mosaic virus adaptation to eIF4E-mediated resistance in lettuce.","abstract":"We previously showed that allelic genes mol¹ and mo1² used to protect lettuce crops against Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV) correspond to mutant alleles of the gene encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. LMV resistance-breaking determinants map not only to the main potyvirus virulence determinant, a genome-linked viral protein, but also to the C-terminal region of the cylindrical inclusion (CI), with a key role of amino acid at position 621. Here, we show that the propagation of several non-lettuce isolates of LMV in mo1¹ plants is accompanied by a gain of virulence correlated with the presence in the CI C terminus of a serine at position 617 and the accumulation of mutations at positions 602 or 627. Whole-genome sequencing of native and evolved isolates showed that no other mutation could be associated with adaptation to mo1 resistance. Site-directed mutagenesis pinpointed the key role in the virulence of the combination of mutations at positions 602 and 617, in addition to position 621. The impact of these mutations on the fitness of the virus was evaluated, suggesting that the durability of mo1 resistance in the field relies on the fitness cost associated with the resistance-breaking mutations, the nature of the mutations, and their potential antagonistic effects.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
