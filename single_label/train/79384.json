Participants were randomised in two groups of 22 and treated with either the Epley manoeuvre or a sham manoeuvre and followed up for 1 year after treatment.Conversion of a 'positive' Dix-Hallpike test to a 'negative' Dix-Hallpike test, impairments perceived by the dizziness assessed by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI).Absolute and relative risks were computed, and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the treatments.Six patients were lost to follow up (five in the sham group, one in the Epley group). The Epley procedure resulted in a treatment success in 20/22 patients (91%) after 12 months of follow-up, whereas the sham procedure had a positive effect in 10/22 patients (46%; P = 0.001). The DHI was significantly lower in the Epley group at all follow-up assessments (median scores 12 months 0 (0-51) versus 20 (0-76), P = 0.003).The Epley manoeuvre provides long-term resolution of symptoms in patients with posterior canal BPPV.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438128","annotations":[{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.406255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.27543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"1022","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1022"},{"name":"2022","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022"},{"name":"Professional wrestling match types","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Conversion disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_disorder"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Posterior semicircular canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
