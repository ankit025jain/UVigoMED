{"id":77252,"title":"Psychopathology and eating disorders in patients with psoriasis.","abstract":"Psoriasis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory skin disease that often occurs in patients who are overweight or obese. In literature the connections between obesity and eating disorders are well known, but few studies have investigated the link between eating disorders and psoriasis. We hypothesized that Eating Disorders (ED) can be considered a psychogenic cofactors, which contribute to the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in psoriatic patients, who are frequently prone to psychiatric comorbidity.From January to April 2011 we enrolled 100 consecutive psoriatic outpatients and a control group of 100 selected non-psoriatic outpatients, matched by age, gender, and BMI to the study group. The assessment battery was composed by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score, the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-RÂ®).Our data showed that most of EDI and SCL-90R subscales was mostly altered in psoriatic population compared to patients without psoriasis. Moreover, we noticed in patients with psoriasis an association between the progressive weight increase and an impairment on most of EDI subscales.Psoriasis is associated with psychopathological traits, which are frequently found in EDs. Since obesity makes psoriasis less susceptible to therapy and weight loss improves drug response, dermatologists should be alert to suspect the presence of this condition.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
