{"id":73307,"title":"A review of platelet derived growth factor playing pivotal role in bone regeneration.","abstract":"This article is focused on the literature review and study of recent advances in the field of bone grafting, which involves platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as one of the facilitating factors in bone regeneration. This article includes a description of the mechanism of PDGF for use in surgeries where bone grafting is required, which promotes future application of PDGF for faster bone regeneration or inhibition of bone growth if required as in osteosarcoma. The important specific activities of PDGF include mitogenesis (increase in the cell populations of healing cells), angiogenesis (endothelial mitoses into functioning capillaries), and macrophage activation (debridement of the wound site and a second phase source of growth factors for continued repair and bone regeneration). Thus PDGF can be utilized in wound with bone defect to conceal the wound with repair of bony defect.
