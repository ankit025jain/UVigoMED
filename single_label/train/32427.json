{"id":32427,"title":"First symbols in a girl with Down syndrome: a longitudinal study from 12 to 18 months.","abstract":"Symbolic uses of objects originate in communicative and triadic contexts (adult-child-object). In this longitudinal study we explore the emergence and development of the first symbolic uses in triadic interaction contexts in a girl with Down syndrome between 12 and 18-months of age. We conducted five sessions of video recording, at 12, 13½, 15, 16½, and 18 months chronological age. At each session we videotaped the girl and her mother interacting with different objects. Data were coded in semiotic categories used in previous studies (Rodríguez & Moro, 1999) and a microgenetic analysis was conducted for each session. The first symbolic uses by the girl appeared at 13½ months. Symbols were of different types and levels of complexity, and the adult had an important role in facilitating the production of these symbols.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956501","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Symbol","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.367958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.14279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Moro people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_people"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Sign (semiotics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)"},{"name":"Evolutionary grade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_grade"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"}]}
