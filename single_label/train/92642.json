{"id":92642,"title":"Effects of selective MMP-13 inhibition in squamous cell carcinoma depend on estrogen.","abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinases like MMP-13 cleave and remodel the extracellular matrix and thereby play a crucial role in tumor progression in vivo. Using a highly selective inhibitor to block MMP-13 protein activity, we demonstrate a striking inhibitory effect on invasive tumor growth and vascularization in murine skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Therapy outcome critically depends on animal age in C57Bl/6 mice and was successful in old female but not in young female mice. Treatment success was recovered by ovariectomy in young and abolished by 17ß-estradiol supplementation in old mice, suggesting a hormone dependent inhibitor effect. Responsiveness of the tumorigenic keratinocytes BDVII and fibroblasts to 17ß-estradiol was confirmed in vitro, where MMP-13 inhibitor treatment led to a reduction of cell invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. This correlated well with a less invasive and vascularized tumor in treated mice in vivo. 17ß-estradiol supplementation also reduced invasion and VEGF release in vitro with no additional reduction on MMP-13 inhibitor treatment. This suggests that low 17ß-estradiol levels in old mice in vivo lead to enhanced MMP-13 levels and VEGF release, allowing a more effective inhibitor treatment compared to young mice. In our study, we present a strong link between lower estrogen levels in old female mice, an elevated MMP-13 level, which results in a more effective MMP-13 inhibitor treatment in fibroblasts and SCC cells in vitro and in vivo.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676718","annotations":[{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.501788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.501632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.458333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.450154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.427706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.20868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"}]}
