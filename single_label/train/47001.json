{"id":47001,"title":"Laparoscopic roux limb placement over a fistula defect without mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis: a modified technique for surgical management of chronic proximal fistulas after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.","abstract":"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is an increasingly popular bariatric procedure. A chronic fistula at the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) is a rare but life-threatening complication of this procedure whose causes are still unclear and management is still controversial.A 41-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 38 developed an EGJ leak 6 days post-LSG. Despite initial control with conservative measures, the leak persisted and resulted in a left pleural abscess and a broncho-pleural fistula requiring thoracotomy with resection of the abscessed lung parenchyma. Endoscopic and drainage procedures failed to prevent subdiaphragmatic recurring collection due to the persistent fistula. Nineteen months after LSG, a Roux limb was placed on the EGJ and sutured side to side around the fistula defect, without mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis.The postoperative course was uneventful and, 20 months later (39 months post-LSG), the patient is well with a BMI of 27.Laparoscopic apposition of a Roux-en-Y limb without mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis as an efferent path to drain the undebrided fistula defect can effectively treat chronic leaks at the EGJ after LSG.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610455","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.763876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.732418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.376849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.343046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.217779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.049885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Sleeve gastrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve_gastrectomy"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Drain (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_(surgery)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
