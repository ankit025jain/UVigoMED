{"id":64972,"title":"[DAZL and male infertility: an update].","abstract":"DAZL, a member of the DAZ family, plays a key role in human spermatogenesis. It regulates the promoter via genetic modification, especially DNA methylation, promoting the transcription of DAZL. Besides, the relation of DAZL SNPs with male infertility has been a hot spot of research for many years. It is deduced that local and ethnic factors may be associated with the failure of spermatogenesis. This article presents an overview on the results of recent studies, changes in the DNA methylation of DAZL in spermatogenesis, and the association of DAZL SNPs with male infertility, aiming to provide a new theoretical basis and clinical strategy for the treatment of male infertility.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095623","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.752452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.558974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.473762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Spermatogenesis","weight":0.228889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"DAZL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZL"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Hotspot (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)"},{"name":"DAZ1","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZ1"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Theory (mathematical logic)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_(mathematical_logic)"}]}
