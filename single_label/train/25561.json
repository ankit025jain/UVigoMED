{"id":25561,"title":"Simultaneous thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and coronary artery bypass grafting through median sternotomy.","abstract":"Patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) often have severe ischemic heart disease. The determination of which condition to treat first is based on disease severity, but in some cases the conditions are equally severe. A 78-year-old woman received a diagnosis of a 59-mm TAAA and coronary artery stenosis. We performed simultaneous TAAA repair, using the patched aortoplasty method, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) through a median sternotomy. No perioperative complications occurred, the patient was discharged in stable condition, and early follow-up visits were uneventful.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193190","annotations":[{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.879204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.785081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0361946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}]}
