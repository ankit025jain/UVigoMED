{"id":83466,"title":"Safety assessment of hydroethanolic rambutan rind extract: acute and sub-chronic toxicity studies.","abstract":"This study evaluated the safety of rambutan rind extract (RRE) in male Wistar rats. While acute toxicity was evaluated by feeding the rats with single doses of RRE (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 mg/kg) and its sub-chronic toxicity was observed in rats orally administered with RRE (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) daily for 30 days. In acute toxicity study, the LD50 was found to be greater than 5000 mg/kg of RRE. In sub-chronic toxicity study, no mortality and sign of toxicity was found up to 1000 mg/kg/day of RRE. At 2000 mg/kg/day dose, the mortality rate was 12.5%. Significant decreases in body weight gain and food consumption were found in both acute and sub-chronic toxicity studies. In acute toxicity study, all the studied doses of RRE did not alter serum levels of triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) andalanine aminotransferase (ALT). In sub-chronic toxicity study, all studied doses of RRE significantly decreased plasma levels of TG and blood urea nitrogen, but did not alter plasma levels of AST and ALT. TC levels did not show any significant change in both the studies. The obtained results provide basic information for in vivo experimental studies of the pharmacological potentiality of RRE.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345248","annotations":[{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.816124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.717984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.504832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.481533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.39426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.366109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"}]}
