{"id":53209,"title":"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of hetero-aromatic moieties substituted pyrrole-2-carbonitrile derivatives as dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors.","abstract":"A series of novel hetero-aromatic moieties substituted ?-amino pyrrole-2-carbonitrile derivatives was designed and synthesized based on structure-activity relationships (SARs) of pyrrole-2-carbonitrile inhibitors. All compounds demonstrated good dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitory activities (IC50 = 0.004-113.6 ?M). Moreover, compounds 6h (IC50 = 0.004 ?M) and 6n (IC50 = 0.01 ?M) showed excellent inhibitory activities against DPP4, good selectivity (compound 6h, selective ratio: DPP8/DPP4 = 450.0; DPP9/DPP4 = 375.0; compound 6n, selective ratio: DPP8/DPP4 = 470.0; DPP9/DPP4 = 750.0) and good efficacy in an oral glucose tolerance test in ICR mice. Furthermore, compounds 6h and 6n demonstrated moderate PK properties (compound 6h, F% = 37.8%, t1/2 = 1.45 h; compound 6n, F% = 16.8%, t1/2 = 3.64 h).","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531224","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.806098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.76437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Nitrile","weight":0.666265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrile"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.497371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"DPP8","weight":0.433887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP8"},{"name":"DPP9","weight":0.433887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP9"},{"name":"Pyrrole","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrole"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.38428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.358033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.345466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0884832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0628516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Democratic Progressive Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"375","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/375"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"John Carter (character)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carter_(character)"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Intelligent character recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_character_recognition"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Administrative_Region_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"470 (dinghy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/470_(dinghy)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
