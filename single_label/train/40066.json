{"id":40066,"title":"Surveillance for outbreaks of gastroenteritis in elderly long-term care facilities in France, November 2010 to May 2012.","abstract":"This article describes outbreaks of gastroenteritis in elderly long-term care facilities (LTCF) in France from November 2010 to May 2012 reported through the surveillance system for gastroenteritis outbreaks in LTCF. A total of 1,072 outbreaks were reported, causing 26,551 episodes of illness and 60 deaths. The median attack rate (AR) among residents was 32%. Norovirus and person-to-person transmission were the most frequently reported aetiology and mode of transmission. Control measures were implemented in 1,054 (98%) outbreaks and for 928 outbreaks, the timing of such measures could be inferred. Of these, 799 (86%) had put control measures into effect within three days of the occurrence of the first case. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis in LTCF cause substantial morbidity and mortality among elderly people in France. LTCF are encouraged to develop infection prevention and control plans and to notify any gastroenteritis outbreak to health authorities to ensure rapid control.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080141","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.731667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.210564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"France","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Attack rate","weight":0.0301095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_rate"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"799","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/799"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Tornado outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak"},{"name":"Health regions of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_regions_of_Canada"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"2010 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup"}]}
