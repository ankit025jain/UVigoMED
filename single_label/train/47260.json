{"id":47260,"title":"[Problem of standardization in colorectal ESD].","abstract":"Colorectal ESD (endoscopic submucosal dissection) has enabled detailed pathological search even for large colorectal tumor was difficult to treat in EMR (endoscopic mucosal resection). However, colorectal ESD has the technical difficulty, because accidental complication is high compared to the EMR, but is becoming safer, being established along with ingenuity procedure, the improvement of the endoscopic peripheral device. The difficulty to treat cases of fibrosis, deployment difficulties submucosa, confrontation lesions, operability failure of the endoscope, and the impact of heart beat and respiratory variation are problem of standardization in colorectal ESD.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597366","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.721085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.303171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cardiac cycle","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"}]}
