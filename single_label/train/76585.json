{"id":76585,"title":"Pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of osteomalacia.","abstract":"Osteomalacia is a musculoskeletal condition that results in soft bones due to ineffective mineralisation. Nurses have a unique opportunity to improve awareness of osteomalacia and reduce its incidence through health education. Multidisciplinary management is important to minimise the effect of osteomalacia on activities of daily living and reduce the risk of fracture due to poor mineralisation of the bones.
