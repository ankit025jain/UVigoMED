{"id":2812,"title":"Factors influencing the shear rate acting on silicone oil to cause silicone oil emulsification.","abstract":"The shear force between silicone oil (SO) bubble and aqueous during eye movements may underlie the development of SO emulsification. This study examines factors that may affect such shear force induced by eye movements.A surface-modified model eye chamber was put under large-amplitude eye movements (amplitude 90°, angular velocity 360°/s, and a duration 300 ms). Agarose-made indentations were introduced to mimic the effect of encircling scleral buckle. Two SOs (1300 and 5000 centistokes [cSt]), three volumes (3, 4, and 5 mL), and two eye chambers (with and without indentation) were tested. Video recording was used to capture the movements of SO inside the model chamber under various conditions.The presence of indentation within the eye chamber significantly reduced the velocity of SO movements relative to the eye chamber movements (P < 0.001). To a lesser extent, an increase in viscosity also had a significant effect in reducing the relative movements. No significant effect was observed for the extent of SO fill in the chamber.Our experimental model suggests indentation within an eye, such as that created by scleral buckling, may have the greatest influence in reducing shear force induced by eye movements. Therefore, using an encircling scleral buckle may be similarly or more effective than using SO with higher viscosity in lowering the propensity to SO emulsification.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358732","annotations":[{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.733472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.652514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Shear rate","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_rate"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.413105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Angular velocity","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity"},{"name":"Liquid bubble","weight":0.344756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.31253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Silicone oil","weight":0.280063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_oil"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.198885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.158969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.148525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.117661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Scleral buckle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_buckle"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Buckling","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling"},{"name":"Acting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting"},{"name":"1300","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1300"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Ferrari 360","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_360"},{"name":"Indentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation"},{"name":"Eye movement (sensory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory)"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Xbox 360","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
