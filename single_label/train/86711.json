{"id":86711,"title":"Addition of aprepitant improves protection against cisplatin-induced emesis when a conventional anti-emetic regimen fails.","abstract":"We investigated whether aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 antagonist, could decrease chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) following cisplatin, when a conventional anti-emetic regimen had failed.This was a prospective study (April 2011-April 2012) of patients with lung cancer, treated with cisplatin at the Beijing Cancer Hospital, and initially receiving granisetron, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide as anti-emetics. If patients experienced vomiting of grade ?2 and required rescue anti-emetic medications during the first cycle, oral aprepitant was added in subsequent cycles (day 1: 125 mg; days 2-3: 80 mg once daily). Acute (day 1) and delayed (days 2-5) nausea and vomiting, use of rescue medications, and occurrence of adverse reactions were monitored after the start of chemotherapy.Twenty-five of 132 patients (18.9 %) were administered aprepitant for secondary prophylaxis against emesis during the second cycle of chemotherapy. The incidences of acute and delayed nausea were 52 and 100 % in the first cycle, but 8 and 72 % in the second cycle. The incidences of acute and delayed vomiting were 20 and 100 % in the first cycle, but 0 and 36 % in the second cycle. No patients required rescue medications or intravenous rehydration during the second cycle. Aprepitant was not associated with additional adverse events.In patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the addition of aprepitant to a 5-HT3 antagonist, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide improves protection against CINV when the conventional anti-emetic regimen fails.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748417","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Granisetron","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granisetron"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Metoclopramide","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoclopramide"},{"name":"Aprepitant","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprepitant"},{"name":"Antiemetic","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.779335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.679123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.305037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.244936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.189344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Tachykinin peptides","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachykinin_peptides"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
