{"id":54458,"title":"Thyroidectomy for Graves' disease: a feasibility study of the robotic transaxillary approach.","abstract":"Graves' disease (GD) is considered a relative contraindication for endoscopic approaches to the thyroid gland, due to a larger gland size and increased vascularity.A retrospective analysis of a single surgeon's experience was performed. We included all patients who underwent thyroidectomy for the treatment of GD over a 3-year period.Twenty-five patients with GD were identified. Twelve of them underwent robotic thyroidectomy and 13 patients underwent conventional thyroidectomy. Age, gender, and BMI were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). The conventional approach allowed for resection of larger thyroid volumes (147.3 ± 153.6 ml), as compared to the robotic approach (62.3 ± 47.8 ml, p = 0.08). The average total operative times were similar in both groups (p = 0.98). There was no difference with respect to intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.49), duration of hospital stay (p = 0.38), and complication rates (p = 0.99).Robotic thyroidectomy is feasible and can be safely performed in appropriately selected patients with GD.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457627","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.816705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.777519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.748946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.64303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.566265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.509266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.496338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graves' disease","weight":0.450674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves'_disease"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.38543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Guangdong","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong"},{"name":"Graves","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves"},{"name":"Feasibility study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"}]}
