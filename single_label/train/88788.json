{"id":88788,"title":"Post-vertebral augmentation spine imaging.","abstract":"Although imaging plays a critical role and has become an integral part in preprocedure evaluation of osteoporotic patients at risk of compression fracture, many treated patients undergo follow-up imaging, for reasons ranging from potential procedure-related complications to development of new symptoms after initial improvement after successful vertebral augmentation (VA). Although imaging is frequently obtained for evaluation of these patients, there is a general lack of knowledge about imaging characteristics of treated vertebrae. This article reviews various indications for post-VA imaging, the appearance of augmented spine on imaging, and the important complications associated with the VA procedure.
