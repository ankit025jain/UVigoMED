{"id":89199,"title":"Biomechanical investigation of the supraorbital arch - a transient FEA study on the impact of physical blows.","abstract":"As fractures of the supraorbital region are far less common than midfacial or orbital fractures, a study was initiated to investigate whether fist blows could lead to fractures similar to those often seen in the midface.A detailed skull model and an impactor resembling a fist were created and a fist blow to the supraorbital region was simulated. A transient finite element analysis was carried out to calculate von Mises stresses, peak force, and impact time.Within the contact zone of skull and impactor critical stress values could be seen which lay at the lower yield border for potential fractures. A second much lower stress zone was depicted in the anterior-medial orbital roof.In this simulation a fist punch, which could generate distinct fractures in the midface and naso-ethmoid-orbital region, would only reach the limits of a small fracture in the supraorbital region. The reason is seen in the strong bony architecture. Much higher forces are needed to create severe trauma in the upper face which is supported by clinical findings. Finite element analysis is the method of choice to investigate the impact of trauma on the human skeleton.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745339","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.599862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.550523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.543316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Human skeleton","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skeleton"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.408908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.3973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.106844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.0351996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Roof","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Markov chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Richard von Mises","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Mises"},{"name":"Von Mises","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises"},{"name":"Impact (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Yield (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(engineering)"},{"name":"Punch (tool)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(tool)"},{"name":"Finite set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"}]}
