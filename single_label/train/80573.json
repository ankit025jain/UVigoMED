{"id":80573,"title":"Human African trypanosomiasis with 7-year incubation period: clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging findings.","abstract":"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also referred to as \"sleeping sickness\", is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Diagnosing imported HAT outside endemic areas is difficult and diagnosis is often delayed. We report a case of imported human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense with an unusually long incubation period of at least 7 years. A 33 year old male African patient, a former resident of Cameroon, presented with a 4-month history of progressive personality changes. A few weeks before presentation the patient had first been admitted to a psychiatric ward and received antidepressant treatment, until a lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis and then antibiotic treatment for suspected neuroborreliosis was initiated. The patient continued to deteriorate during antibiotic treatment and became increasingly lethargic. Under antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory treatment, the condition of the patient gradually improved over the following months and he recovered completely after 24 months of follow-up. This well-documented case illustrates typical difficulties in establishing the correct diagnosis outside endemic areas and provides an overview of typical clinical, neuropathological and neuroimaging findings in T. b. gambiense trypanosomiasis, guiding the clinician in establishing the correct diagnosis in this rare disease.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613272","annotations":[{"name":"Lumbar puncture","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_puncture"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.796211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.663999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"African trypanosomiasis","weight":0.563707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.326876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.298195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.273167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.269158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Trypanosoma brucei","weight":0.122452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_brucei"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.119851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Antiparasitic","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparasitic"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Neuroborreliosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroborreliosis"},{"name":"Trypanosomiasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosomiasis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"}]}
