{"id":90748,"title":"Proximal humeral nonunion treated with an intramedullary tantalum cylinder.","abstract":"Nonunion is uncommon after proximal humerus fracture surgery. There is no agreement about preferred method of treatment. Traditional approaches have included laterally based locking plates, autogenous grafting, and endosteal support to provide improved biomechanical stability. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of proximal humeral nonunion has been performed with various methods, including blade plates and bone grafting, as well as intramedullary support with autologous or allogenic grafts. Both malunion and nonunion have occurred after ORIF with locking plates. Endosteal support in the form of a fibular allograft incorporated into the locking plate construct can increase mechanical stability in selected cases. An ideal implant for proximal humeral nonunion provides medial column mechanical support and osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. Porous intramedullary tantalum metal may play a role in nonunion surgery as an alternative to fibular allograft because of its versatility of use and salutary biological effects. It offers many material advantages for use in nonunion surgery. Tantalum is extensively porous (75%-80%), has a stiffness close to that of native bone, and offers the possibility of being a carrier for osteoinductive materials. It may also be suitable for patients who refuse allograft material. This article describes a 65-year-old woman with recalcitrant proximal humeral nonunion who was successfully treated with revision ORIF with intramedullary tantalum cylinder augmentation with a lateral-based locking plate and autogenous cancellous bone grafting. At 5-year follow-up, she had excellent motion and clinical and radiographic union.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579230","annotations":[{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.853322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.806565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.803385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.800359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.595281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.504298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.421785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.340778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.315857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.299465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.279399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Endosteum","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosteum"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.166553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Tantalum","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0791456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Humerus fracture","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus_fracture"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Allogenic succession","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogenic_succession"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Recalcitrant seed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recalcitrant_seed"},{"name":"Native plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant"}]}
