{"id":88059,"title":"Quality of life and self-esteem in patients with paraplegia and pressure ulcers: a controlled cross-sectional study.","abstract":"To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and self-esteem in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and pressure ulcers.This study was a controlled cross-sectional study. HRQoL was assessed using the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem/UNIFESP-EPM Scale. A total of 120 patients with traumatic SCI were included in the sample, of which 60 had pressure ulcers and were assigned to the study group, and 60 had no pressure ulcers and were assigned to the control group. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t-test.Of the 60 patients in the study group, 83.3% were men and the mean age was 38.17 years (SD = 9.08 years). When compared with controls, patients in the study group reported significantly lower scores (worse health status) on all SF-36 subscales (p less than or equal to 0.0013) except for general health (p=0.109). The RSE/UNIFESP-EMP scale total score indicated that patients with pressure ulcers had significantly lower self-esteem than controls (p<0.001).Pressure ulcers had an adverse impact on the HRQoL and self-esteem of patients with SCI.There were no external sources of funding for this study. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920204","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.814578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.757508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.706065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.439153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.423913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.336774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.323759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.253319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.0619954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Conflict of interest","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
