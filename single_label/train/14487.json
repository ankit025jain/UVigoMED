{"id":14487,"title":"Systemic Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis infection in a Yorkshire pig with severe disseminated suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis.","abstract":"An 18-week-old female breeding Yorkshire pig displayed symptoms of astasia and subsequently died. Histologically, severe disseminated suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis was detected, as were numerous myocardial microabscesses. Gram-positive cocci were detected in these suppurative lesions, and these cocci reacted with an antibody against Streptococcus C group species. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lungs, pleural abscess and articular fluid of the right tarsal joint. The isolates were ?-hemolytic, categorized into Lancefield group C and were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis by analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. This is the first report of systemic S. equisimilis infection in a pig with severe disseminated suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis.
