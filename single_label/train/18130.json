{"id":18130,"title":"Comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the US.","abstract":"Previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to HIV infection and shedding. We assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the United States.Genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from 46 US women (36 HIV-infected, 10 HIV-uninfected) and 40 Rwandan women (18 HIV-infected, 22 HIV-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) Nugent scores. Species of Lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. Prevalence of genera and Lactobacillus species were compared using Fisher's exact tests.Overall the seven most prevalent genera were Lactobacillus (74%), Prevotella (56%), Gardnerella (55%), Atopobium (42%), Sneathia (37%), Megasphaera (30%), and Parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing Rwandan to US women, except for Megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p?=?0.06). Additionally, Rwandan women had higher frequencies of Mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p?=?0.06) and Eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p?=?0.02), and lower frequencies of Lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and Allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with US women. The prevalence of Mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in HIV-infected Rwandan women (39%), compared to HIV-infected US women (6%), HIV-uninfected Rwandan (9%) and US (10%) women. The most prevalent lactobacillus species in both Rwandan and US women was L. iners (58% vs. 76%, p?=?0.11), followed by L. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p?=?0.82), L. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p?=?0.80), L. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p?=?0.37) and L. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p?=?0.10).We found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and Lactobacillus species in Rwandan and US women. Further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817204","annotations":[{"name":"Gardnerella vaginalis","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardnerella_vaginalis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.772901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.571292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.445995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.425276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Phylogenetic tree","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree"},{"name":"Rwanda","weight":0.188198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.174836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Prevotella","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevotella"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Female reproductive system (human)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system_(human)"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"}]}
