{"id":14506,"title":"P2X7 antagonists as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of CNS disorders.","abstract":"The use of P2X7 antagonists to treat inflammatory disorders has garnered considerable interest in recent years. An increasing number of literature reports support the role of P2X7 in inflammatory pathways of the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNSs). A number of CNS indications such as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain have been linked to a neuroinflammatory response, and clinical studies have shown that inflammatory biomarkers can be mitigated by modulating P2X7. Recent scientific and patent literature describing novel P2X7 antagonists has indicated their use in CNS disorders. In addition, several reports have disclosed the results of administering P2X7 antagonists in pre-clinical models of CNS disease or investigating brain uptake. This review describes small molecule P2X7 antagonists that have first appeared in the literature since 2009 and have potential therapeutic utility in the CNS, or for which new data have emerged implicating their use in CNS indications.
