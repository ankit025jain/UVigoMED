{"id":62620,"title":"Alloimmune neonatal neutropenia in Croatia during the 1998-2008 period.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of the disease and to analyze laboratory data of 23 newborns undergoing serologic testing for alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (ANN) during the 1998-2008 period in Croatia.Laboratory data on 23 newborns undergoing serologic testing for ANN during the 1998-2008 period and epidemiologic data on the number of live births in Croatia were analyzed. Laboratory testing for ANN included serologic screening of maternal and neonatal sera and granulocytes (neutrophils) by immunofluorescence (IF) method. The monoclonal antibody immobilization of neutrophil antigens (MAINA) was employed to determine anti-HNA antibody specificity.Anti-HNA antibodies were detected in seven (54%) of 13 cases of serologically positive ANN. Only anti-HLA class I antibodies were demonstrated in four (31%) of 13 cases In the 2007-2008 period of prospective data collection, the number of serologically verified ANN cases was one case per 17,323 live births. Results of the prospective study conducted at Maternity Ward, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center yielded the ANN incidence of one case per 2843 live births.Monitoring of neutrophil count in neonatal blood and serologic testing for ANN in case of isolated neutropenia in the newborn contributed considerably to timely detection of ANN.Neonatal alloimmune neutropenia-incidence, serologic diagnosis, antineutrophil antibodies, anti-HNA, anti-HLA class I, Croatia.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548251","annotations":[{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.55682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.49088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.186224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Alloimmunity","weight":0.132397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloimmunity"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"}]}
