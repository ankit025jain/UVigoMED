{"id":78285,"title":"Prospective evaluation of the clinical utility of laryngeal electromyography.","abstract":"To prospectively evaluate the clinical utility of laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.The study involved 50 consecutive patients referred for LEMG. Laryngologists initially indicated diagnoses and treatment plans under the assumption of no access to LEMG. Patients then underwent LEMG by blinded examiners. LEMG results were reviewed by each patient's laryngologist. Diagnoses and treatment plans were either maintained or altered based on the LEMG results.The diagnosis changed 10% (5/50) of the time and treatment plans were altered 36% (18/50) of the time based on information provided by LEMG. Observational periods were eliminated in 13/50 patients based on LEMG, moving them to permanent treatment. LEMG allowed the differentiation between joint fixation and bilateral paralysis in three patients. Previously unrecognized superior laryngeal neuropathies were identified in three patients.Laryngeal electromyography often provides clinically useful information that typically leads to a more accurate diagnosis and a more appropriate, expedited treatment plan.2b.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715712","annotations":[{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.878965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.706631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.564681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.472588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.211848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0602196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"1850","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1850"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"1350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1350"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Clinical utility of diagnostic tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_utility_of_diagnostic_tests"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
