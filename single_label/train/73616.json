{"id":73616,"title":"A combination of p300 and Braf expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma.","abstract":"To date only a handful of drugs are available for the treatment of melanoma. Among them vemurafenib, a BrafV600E specific inhibitor, showed promising results in terms of response rate and increase in median survival time. However, its effectiveness is limited by development of resistance and the search for additional drugs for melanoma treatment is ongoing. The present study was performed to analyze the correlation between Braf expression and the expression of p300, a known down stream target of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which was recently shown by us to be a prognostic marker for melanoma progression and patient survival.The expression of Braf and p300 expression were correlated and analyzed by Chi-square test. A total of 327 melanoma patient cases (193 primary melanoma and 134 metastatic melanoma) were used for the study. Classification & regression tree (CRT), Kaplan-Meier, and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to elucidate the significance of the combination of Braf and p300 expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma.Our results demonstrate that Braf expression is inversely correlated with nuclear p300 and positively correlated with cytoplasmic p300 expression. Braf and cytoplasmic p300 were found to be associated with melanoma progression, tumor size and ulceration status. CRT analysis revealed that a combination of Braf and p300 expression (nuclear and cytoplasmic), could be used to distinguish between nevi and melanoma, and primary from metastatic melanoma lesions. The combination of Braf and nuclear p300 was significantly associated with patient survival and nuclear p300 was found to be an independent predictor of patient survival.Our results indicate a cross-talk between Braf and p300 in melanoma and demonstrate the importance Braf and p300 expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893747","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Vemurafenib","weight":0.531015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemurafenib"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.408254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.333448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nevus","weight":0.253562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.241581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.241559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.234829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.213174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.186947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.148965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0965452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Decision tree learning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning"},{"name":"EP300","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP300"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
