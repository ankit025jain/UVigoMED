{"id":92467,"title":"Beta-tricalcium phosphate shows superior absorption rate and osteoconductivity compared to hydroxyapatite in open-wedge high tibial osteotomy.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to clinically and radiologically compare the utility, osteoconductivity, and absorbability of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) spacers in medial open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO).Thirty-eight patients underwent medial open-wedge HTO with a locking plate. In the first 19 knees, a HAp spacer was implanted in the opening space (HAp group). In the remaining 19 knees, a TCP spacer was implanted in the same manner (TCP group). All patients underwent clinical and radiological examinations before surgery and at 18 months after surgery.Concerning the background factors, there were no statistical differences between the two groups. Post-operatively, the knee score significantly improved in each group. Concerning the post-operative knee alignment and clinical outcome, there was no statistical difference in each parameter between the two groups. Regarding the osteoconductivity, the modified van Hemert's score of the TCP group was significantly higher (p = 0.0009) than that of the HAp group in the most medial osteotomy zone. The absorption rate was significantly greater in the TCP group than in the HAp group (p = 0.00039).The present study demonstrated that a TCP spacer was significantly superior to a HAp spacer concerning osteoconductivity and absorbability at 18 months after medial open-wedge HTO.Retrospective comparative study, Level III.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24045917","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.74157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.696993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.297458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0549242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0534202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Transmission Control Protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Waco 10","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_10"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Van","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van"},{"name":"Comparative politics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_politics"}]}
