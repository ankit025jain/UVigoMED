{"id":77524,"title":"Lifetime experiences of hypomanic symptoms are associated with delayed and irregular sleep-wake cycle and seasonality in non-clinical adult samples.","abstract":"Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle and seasonality have been reported in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Considering that BD seems to be a spectrum condition in terms of clinical and biological characteristics, circadian and seasonal rhythm related to BD could be detected in non-clinical individuals with subthreshold bipolarity. The aim of this study was to screen past hypomanic symptoms in non-clinical samples and investigate their association with deviated sleep-wake cycle and seasonality.Lifetime history of hypomanic symptoms was assessed with the Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32). Circadian preference, variability of sleep-wake time and seasonal changes in mood and behavior were evaluated on a lifetime-basis in non-clinical adult samples (n=313), using the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM), the Sleep Timing Questionnaire (STQ), and the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ).Two subdomains of hypomanic symptoms were identified through factor analysis of HCL-32, i.e., \"active/elated\" factor and \"irritable/risk-taking\" factor. The HCL-32 total score (p<0.001) and the \"active/elated\" factor score (p=0.028) were weakly correlated only with seasonality, whereas the \"irritable/risk-taking\" factor score was associated not only with seasonality (p<0.001), but also with evening preference (p<0.001) and irregularity of sleep-wake times (p=0.001~0.011).Circadian and seasonal characteristics related to BD are also associated with a past history of hypomanic symptoms in non-clinical samples, especially \"irritable/risk-taking\" symptoms, suggesting the existence of subclinical presentation of BD and their biological traits.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Occupational
