{"id":48567,"title":"Cognitive screening in patients with diabetes in primary care.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing; therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment within this population is important as it may improve these patients' diabetes self-care. Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment commences with cognitive screening in the primary care setting. Although there is robust evidence of the link between diabetes and dementia, cognitive screening within this population is not routinely completed. This article reviews the most commonly used cognitive screening tools and evaluates the applicability of these within the primary care setting for patients with diabetes.
