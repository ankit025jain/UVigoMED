{"id":78063,"title":"Sarcasm and advanced theory of mind understanding in children and adults with prelingual deafness.","abstract":"Two studies addressed key theoretical debates in theory of mind (ToM) development by comparing (a) deaf native signers (n = 18), (b) deaf late signers (n = 59), and (c) age-matched hearing persons (n = 74) in childhood (Study 1: n = 81) and adulthood (Study 2: n = 70) on tests of first- and second-order false belief and conversational sarcasm. Results showed ToM development to be a life span phenomenon for deaf and hearing people alike. Native and late signers were outperformed by hearing peers on advanced ToM in childhood (M = 9 years), but in adulthood (M = 40 years), native signers had caught up, whereas late signers had not. Findings highlight the extended importance of conversational interaction for ToM growth.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798505","annotations":[{"name":"Theory of mind","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.649851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.241325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.234122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Music theory","weight":0.145948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Prelingual deafness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelingual_deafness"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Span (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_(architecture)"},{"name":"Sarcasm","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hearing (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(person)"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"}]}
