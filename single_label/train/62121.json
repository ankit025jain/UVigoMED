{"id":62121,"title":"Flow cytometric analysis of cerebrospinal fluid has low diagnostic yield in samples without atypical morphology or prior history of hematologic malignancy.","abstract":"To identify pretest characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens that will allow the rational use of flow cytometric analysis (FCA) in the diagnosis of hematologic malignancy.Retrospective data were collected on 501 consecutive CSF samples submitted for FCA.A positive diagnosis of hematologic malignancy was made in 41 specimens (8.2%). Blasts or atypical lymphocytes were noted on Wright-stained slides in 98% of FCA-positive specimens (40/41), and a history of a hematologic malignancy was present in 89% of specimens (34/38). All FCA-positive specimens had atypical morphology or history of hematologic malignancy. Four hundred six specimens (81%) were FCA negative. Of FCA-negative specimens, 7% (30/406) had atypical morphology, and 3% (12/404) had future central nervous system involvement seen within 30 days.These data support a policy in which FCA of CSF is actively discouraged unless atypical lymphocytes or blasts are seen or a history of hematologic malignancy is present.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619752","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.895554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.632853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.598877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.523877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.383649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.320261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.0556288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0196911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"}]}
