{"id":67799,"title":"Are serum suPAR determinations by current ELISA methodology reliable diagnostic biomarkers for FSGS?","abstract":"A soluble proteinuric substance has been postulated as a cause of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and one candidate soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR). Evaluation of published results shows that serum suPAR determinations by current methodology do not reliably distinguish FSGS from other proteinuric glomerular diseases and serum suPAR cannot currently be considered a valid biomarker for primary or secondary FSGS. However, this should not discourage further research on potential roles of suPAR in proteinuric renal disease, including FSGS.
