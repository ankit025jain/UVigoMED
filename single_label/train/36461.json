{"id":36461,"title":"Wildervanck's syndrome with severe inner ear dysplasia and agenesis of the right internal carotid artery.","abstract":"We describe a case with Wildervanck syndrome (cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome) comprising Klippel-Feil anomaly, retractio bulbi (Duane syndrome), and congenital sensorineural deafness. An 18-month male baby had a severe inner ear dysplasia, and MRI also showed a complex vascular carotid malformation associated.
