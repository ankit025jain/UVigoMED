{"id":81827,"title":"Diagnostic performance of mandibular bone density measurements in assessing osteoporotic status.","abstract":"The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT) bone density measurements (in Hounsfield units [HU]) in assessing the osteoporotic status of edentulous subjects (21 men, 40 women) scheduled to receive mandibular implant-supported overdentures.Density (in HU) of 61 left and 61 right mandibular canine sites was measured. Each subject was also subject to body bone mineral density measurements (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). Bone density T-score values of total hip, femoral neck, spine (L1 to L4), and total body were assessed. Pearson correlations were conducted between HU of each mandibular bone site and the subject's T-score values. Sensitivity/specificity and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to assess the diagnostic performance of HU in detecting subjects who were, based on each of the four T-scores: (1) \"not osteonormal\", ie, with a T-score at or below -1.0; or (2) osteoporotic, ie, with a T-score at or below -2.5.HU measurements of mandibular bone sites were found to have modest but significant correlations with each bone density T-score value (total hip, femoral neck, spine, total body). CT mandibular site HU measurement has diagnostic value in detecting a \"not osteonormal\" condition when total hip, spine, or total body T-scores were used, but not when femoral neck T-score was used.Based on the limited sample size, optimal HU cutoff values of ~530, ~600, and ~640 HU for total hip, spine, or total body T-scores, respectively, were proposed. CT mandibular site HU measurement had diagnostic value in detecting osteoporosis when spine T-score was used but not when total hip, femoral neck, and total body T-scores were used. An optimal HU cutoff value of ~460 HU for spine T-score was proposed.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818206","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.615991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.58549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.501276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.388772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.331433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.281299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.249844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hounsfield scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Mandibular canine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_canine"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_4"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Godfrey Hounsfield","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Hounsfield"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"}]}
