{"id":6356,"title":"Effects of exercise in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis).","abstract":"Exercise training has improved many outcomes in \"clinical\" research involving persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), but there is limited understanding of the underlying \"basic\" pathophysiological mechanisms. The animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), seems ideal for examining the effects of exercise training on MS-disease pathophysiology. EAE is an autoimmune T-helper cell-mediated disease characterized by T-cell and monocyte infiltration and inflammation in the CNS. To that end, this paper briefly describes common models of EAE, reviews existing research on exercise and EAE, and then identifies future research directions for understanding the consequences of exercise training using EAE.
