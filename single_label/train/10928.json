{"id":10928,"title":"Comparison of plasma lipoprotein profiles and malondialdehyde between hyperlipidemia dogs with/without treatment.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to compare metabolic parameters, malondialdehyde as a lipid oxidation marker, and lipid profiles between dogs with untreated hyperlipidemia and hyperlipidemia with treatment, in order to examine the usefulness of malondialdehyde and lipid profiles as diagnostic parameters at early stages of hyperlipidemia.Dog samples were collected from four different veterinary clinics across Japan from March to June 2013. They were separated into three groups: control, untreated hyperlipidemia based on temporally screening, and hyperlipidemia with current anti-hyperlipidemic (statins and fibrates) treatment. Triglyceride levels of untreated hyperlipidemia dogs were significantly higher than those of control dogs. ALT levels of hyperlipidemic dogs with treatment were the highest among three groups. VLDL and LDL of both cholesterol and triglyceride of untreated hyperlipidemia dogs were the highest among three groups. HDL1 levels in triglyceride of hyperlipidemia dogs with treatment were significantly higher than those of control and untreated hyperlipidemia dog. Malondialdehyde concentrations of untreated hyperlipidemia dogs were significantly higher than those of control and hyperlipidemic dogs with treatment.In this study, dogs with untreated hyperlipidemia clearly showed abnormal lipid status, whereas hyperlipidemic dogs under anti-hyperlipidemia treatment showed more normal lipid status suggesting the effectiveness of the therapy. Anti-hyperlipidemics (statins and fibrates) for dogs are also effective in relieving elevated levels of lipids and lipid oxidation. Plasma lipid (triglyceride and cholesterol) profiles and malondialdehyde are useful diagnostic tools for identifying early stages of untreatment hyperlipidemia in dogs.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625120","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.799138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.797516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.713117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.407594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.177158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.174836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.173761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Fibrate","weight":0.150838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrate"},{"name":"Very low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"}]}
