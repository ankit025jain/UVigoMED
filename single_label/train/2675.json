{"id":2675,"title":"Urinary zearalenone levels in girls with premature thelarche and idiopathic central precocious puberty.","abstract":"Recently, it was reported that the development of breast tissue and secondary sex characteristics in girls occurred at much younger age and the incidences of premature thelarce (PT) and central idiopathic precocious puberty (ICPP) are increasing. In this context, we wanted to evaluate the mycoestrogen exposure as triggering factor for premature sexual development.The girls living in Mediterranean region of Turkey were divided in to three groups: control (N.=25; mean age: 6.45 ± 1), PT (N.=28; mean age: 6.86 ± 0.95) and ICPP (N.=25; mean age: 6.97 ± 0.87). Urinary ZEN levels were measured by using ELISA technique and were normalized by urinary creatinine levels. Body Mass Index (BMI) was evaluated and sex hormone levels were also measured.We found that urinary ZEN was detectable in ~81% of all samples and observed an increase of ~2-fold in PT and a significant increase ~2.8-fold in ICPP group vs. control. We did not find any significant correlations between urinary ZEN levels and BMI and sex hormones in any of the groups.To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating urinary ZEN levels in PT and ICPP Turkish patients. We can postulate that ZEN exposure can contribute to the etiology of PT and PP; however further studies on large number of subjects are needed to confirm the present data.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25336100","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Thelarche","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelarche"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.842852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.828969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Secondary sex characteristic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sex_characteristic"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.337213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.329902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Mediterranean Basin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin"},{"name":"Zearalenone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zearalenone"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
