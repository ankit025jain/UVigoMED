{"id":22479,"title":"[In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of absorbable topical hemostatic agents used in the operating room].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of three absorbable, sterile, regenerated oxidized cellulose gauzes against ATCC and clinical isolates of bacterial and fungal strains, in particular those most frequently involved in surgical site infections. The three cellulose devices showed rapid antimicrobial activity against the microbial species tested. Their use could be a valuable adjunct to antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of surgical site infections.
