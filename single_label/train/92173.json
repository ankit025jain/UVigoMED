{"id":92173,"title":"Classification and characteristics of pterygoid process fracture associated with maxillary transverse fracture.","abstract":"This study aimed to classify pterygoid process fractures associated with maxillary transverse fractures.Pterygoid process fractures in 100 patients with maxillary transverse fractures were observed 2- and 3-dimensionally using image processing software. Fracture line course and height and sphenoid sinus involvement were recorded.Pterygoid process fractures were classified as follows: class I, vertical (simple separation between medial and lateral plates); or class II, transverse (3 subcategories according to location of fracture line: II-1, within pterygoid fossa; II-2, above pterygoid fossa, not extending to sphenoid sinus floor; II-3, above pterygoid fossa, involving sphenoid sinus floor). Class I fracture was observed on 5 sides (2.7%); II-1, on 125 (66.5%); II-2, on 36 (19.1%); and II-3, on 22 (1.7%).Pterygoid process fractures were predominantly near the upper edge of the pterygoid fossa. Pneumatization of the pterygoid process is a risk in fractures involving the sphenoid sinus floor.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439920","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.775385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.662605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Skeletal pneumaticity","weight":0.59951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_pneumaticity"},{"name":"Pterygoid processes of the sphenoid","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygoid_processes_of_the_sphenoid"},{"name":"Sphenoidal sinus","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoidal_sinus"},{"name":"Pterygoid fossa","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygoid_fossa"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0565641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0255931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Dimensional analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Fossa (animal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(animal)"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Fracture (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_(geology)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
