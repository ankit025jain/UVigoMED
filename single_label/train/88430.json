{"id":88430,"title":"Twenty-four-hour pattern in French firemen of lag time response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and work-related injury.","abstract":"Circadian cognitive and physical rhythms plus 24 h patterns of accidents and work-related injuries (WRI) have been verified in numerous studies. However, rarely, if ever, have 24 h temporal differences in both work performance and risk of WRI been assessed in the same group of workers. We explored in a homogenous group of French firemen (FM) 24 h patterns of both lag time (LT) response duration to emergency calls for medical help (ECFM) for life-threatening out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA), used as a non-specific index of work performance, and WRI. Our studies demonstrate rather high amplitude statistically significant 24 h patterns of the two variables. The LT response duration was twice as long -0500 h (slowest response) than -1600 h (fastest response). In the same group of FM, the actual number WRI/h was greatest -1600 h and lowest in the early morning hours. However, the 24 h pattern of the relative risk (RR) of WRIs, i.e., per clock hour number of WRI/(total number of responses to emergency calls x number of FM at risk per response), was very different, the RR being greatest -0200 h and lowest in the afternoon. The 24 h pattern in LT response duration to ECMH for OHCA and RR of WRI was strongly correlated (r = +0.85, P < 0.01), with the nocturnal trough (slowest response) in LT response duration coinciding with the nocturnal peak RR of WRI. These findings indicate the requirement for circadian rhythm-based interventions to improve the nocturnal compromised work performance and elevated risk of WRI of shift-working FM.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851404","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.41043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.359066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"France","weight":0.357444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.345557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"FM broadcasting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"1600","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1600"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Firefighter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"},{"name":"Emergency telephone number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"},{"name":"Trough (meteorology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)"}]}
