{"id":13758,"title":"Partial restoration of cardiac function with ?PDZ nNOS in aged mdx model of Duchenne cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Transgenic gene deletion/over-expression studies have established the cardioprotective role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). However, it remains unclear whether nNOS-mediated heart protection can be translated to gene therapy. In this study, we generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) nNOS vector and tested its therapeutic efficacy in the aged mdx model of Duchenne cardiomyopathy. A PDZ domain-deleted nNOS gene (?PDZ nNOS) was packaged into tyrosine mutant AAV-9 and delivered to the heart of ~14-month-old female mdx mice, a phenotypic model of Duchenne cardiomyopathy. Seven months later, we observed robust nNOS expression in the myocardium. Supra-physiological ?PDZ nNOS expression significantly reduced myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis. Importantly, electrocardiography and left ventricular hemodynamics were significantly improved in treated mice. Additional studies revealed increased phosphorylation of phospholamban and p70S6K. Collectively, we have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of the AAV ?PDZ nNOS vector in a symptomatic Duchenne cardiomyopathy model. Our results suggest that the cardioprotective role of ?PDZ nNOS is likely through reduced apoptosis, enhanced phospholamban phosphorylation and improved Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Our study has opened the door to treat Duchenne cardiomyopathy with ?PDZ nNOS gene transfer.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463882","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.793471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.494099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.442005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.376706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.312002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.306858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.298346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.238896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"PDZ domain","weight":0.209512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDZ_domain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.175612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Adeno-associated virus","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeno-associated_virus"}]}
