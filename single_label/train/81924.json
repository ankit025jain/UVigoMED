{"id":81924,"title":"[Specific features of materials for initial pulpitis treatment].","abstract":"The aim of the current study was to assess antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of Biodentine (Septodont), Rootdent (TehnoDent) and adhesive Futurabond ?? (Voco). Two lines of experiments were carried out using cements water solutions and firm tablet-like samples (made by means of special pattern). Citotoxic activity was tested on NCTC L929 mice line fibroblasts culture. All the examined materials showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albi?ans, St. faecalis, mostly evident in Futurabond and the poorest in Biodentine samples. As for cytotoxic properties, Biodentine proved not to suppress metabolic activity stimulating odontotropic impact. The results confirm the analyzed materials to be a useful tool for deep caries lesions and initial pulpitis treatment.
