{"id":66382,"title":"Optimal care of the infant, child, and adolescent on dialysis: 2014 update.","abstract":"Providing optimal care to the infant, child, and adolescent patient who is treated with long-term dialysis therapy mandates that attention be directed to a variety of clinical issues in addition to those related to solute removal and fluid management. Therapeutic plans must be formulated by a multidisciplinary team of pediatric specialists to address the clinical parameters of growth, anemia and osteodystrophy management, cardiovascular health, nutritional adequacy, education, cognitive development, quality of life, preparation for transplantation, and transition to adult care. This review highlights key components of current management recommendations based on a combination of published guidelines, pediatric registry data, and the combined clinical experience of the authors. Whereas some components of this review reflect a modification of the content and recommendations contained in the original publication from more than a decade ago, the contrast emphasizes the advances in understanding and therapeutics of many aspects of pediatric dialysis care that have taken place in the interim. In turn, the content of this article should provide the reader with valuable guidance toward the goal of providing optimal care to patients receiving dialysis.
