{"id":43766,"title":"Obliterative portal venopathy: a study of 48 children.","abstract":"Childhood obliterative portal venopathy presents at any age and may be genetic in origin. We report 48 children with obliterative portal venopathy, based on strict histologic criteria, investigated between 1972 and 2011. Diagnosis requires histology and is suggested by ultrasonography findings. Portal hypertension is the main complication but is absent in some cases. Prognosis is relatively good, but the detection of cardiopulmonary complications is essential.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768253","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.802381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.567795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.425444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0261065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Portal (video game)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
