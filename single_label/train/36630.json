{"id":36630,"title":"Interindividual variability in the cardiac expression of anthracycline reductases in donors with and without Down syndrome.","abstract":"The intracardiac synthesis of anthracycline alcohol metabolites (e.g., daunorubicinol) contributes to the pathogenesis of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity. Cancer patients with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk for anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity. We profiled the expression of anthracycline metabolizing enzymes in hearts from donors with- and without- DS.Cardiac expression of CBR1, CBR3, AKR1A1, AKR1C3 and AKR7A2 was examined by quantitative real time PCR, quantitative immunoblotting, and enzyme activity assays using daunorubicin. The CBR1 polymorphism rs9024 was investigated by allelic discrimination with fluorescent probes. The contribution of CBRs/AKRs proteins to daunorubicin reductase activity was examined by multiple linear regression.CBR1 was the most abundant transcript (average relative expression; DS: 81%, non-DS: 58%), and AKR7A2 was the most abundant protein (average relative expression; DS: 38%, non-DS: 35%). Positive associations between cardiac CBR1 protein levels and daunorubicin reductase activity were found for samples from donors with- and without- DS. Regression analysis suggests that sex, CBR1, AKR1A1, and AKR7A2 protein levels were significant contributors to cardiac daunorubicin reductase activity. CBR1 rs9024 genotype status impacts on cardiac CBR1 expression in non-DS hearts.CBR1, AKR1A1, and AKR7A2 protein levels point to be important determinants for predicting the synthesis of cardiotoxic daunorubicinol in heart.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
