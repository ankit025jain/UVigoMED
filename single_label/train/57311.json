{"id":57311,"title":"Autoamputed uterus within pelvic cavity: a tale of negligence.","abstract":"At maternity worldwide we recognize the complexity and interlinking nature of the many different factors which can prevent women and girls from being able to have access to high quality maternal and family planning care. Our integrated maternal health approach draws on the Three Delays Model which recognizes the different barriers women face in achieving the timely and effective medical care needed to prevent deaths occurring in pregnancy and childbirth. The three delay model proposed by Main in 1993 depicts the roles of communities and the health system as emergency service to protect safe motherhood. The model shows that the result of an obstetric emergency is influenced by factors which govern the decision to seek care, reaching the medical facility and receiving adequate treatment. The three delays break the use of emergency obstetrics care facilities. The article flushes the neglected tragic view of young women for all three delays suffering from septic abortion even at tertiary level care. In our study the substandard management is focused causing the woman to loss her reproductive life.
