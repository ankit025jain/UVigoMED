{"id":70153,"title":"[Jules Baretta and the secrets of modeling in pathology in the 19th century. Analysis of wax No. 1364 at the Museum of the Saint Louis hospital].","abstract":"The Museum of the Saint-Louis hospital in Paris presents life casts produced by Jules Baretta in the 19th century: the casts seem incredible as they captured the complex forms of illness. How could Baretta cast in plaster an irregular epithelium or lupus without damaging the pathology or causing deep pains? From this observation, an investigation on those casts took place and especially one on an epithelium of the nose (no 1364) in order to understand the trade secrets. This investigation shows that Baretta used protective films on these pathologies and that he then interpreted them by modelling. The scientific and artistic interest of this discovery is to revise the mechanical objectivity of the casting through the modelling.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230526","annotations":[{"name":"Paris","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.441771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.390315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Wax","weight":0.313444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"},{"name":"Museum","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Trade secret","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.196861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Trade","weight":0.192973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Saint","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Baretta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baretta"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"1364","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1364"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Complex differential form","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_differential_form"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"St. Louis, Missouri","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
