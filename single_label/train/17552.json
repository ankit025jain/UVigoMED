{"id":17552,"title":"[How to safely and effectively administer aminoglycoside antibiotics].","abstract":"Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AA) are drugs with a narrow therapeutic window and cause severe and often irreversible side effects. They are often used in combination with other antibiotics to treat serious infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative rods. Irreversibly combined with rRNA (16S) subunit of the bacterial 30S ribosomal aminoacyl acceptor site interaction disrupting codon (mRNA) of the anticodon (in tRNA). For the bactericidal effect of AA correspond mainly oxygen free radicals, the concentration of drug in serum and post-antibiotic effect. Studies show that the C max./MIC > 8-12 are associated with higher efficacy. AA can be served in the traditional manner or consolidated. In the course of treatment is necessary to monitor drug concentrations (C max, C min). A limitation in the use of AA is the othotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Despite the limitations of AA remain a significant group of antibacterial agents.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868892","annotations":[{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.829999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Transfer RNA","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.724962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.652751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.63229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"30S","weight":0.421461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30S"},{"name":"Therapeutic window","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.371316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Electron acceptor","weight":0.334377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_acceptor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.322254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anticodon","weight":0.256011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticodon"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.237237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.161358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0179148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Bacillus (shape)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_(shape)"}]}
