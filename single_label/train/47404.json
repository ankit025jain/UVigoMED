{"id":47404,"title":"Transcriptional regulation of miR-146b by C/EBP? LAP2 in esophageal cancer cells.","abstract":"Recent clinical study indicated that up-regulation of miR-146b was associated with poor overall survival of patients in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-146b dysregulation remains to be explored. Here we report that miR-146b promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines. Mechanismly, two C/EBP? binding motifs are located in the miR-146b promoter conserved region. Among the three isoforms of C/EBP?, C/EBP? LAP2 positively regulated miR-146b expression and increases miR-146b levels in a dose-dependent manner through transcription activation of miR-146b gene. Together, these results suggest a miR-146b regulatory mechanism involving C/EBP?, which may contribute to the up-regulation of miR-146b in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589738","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.714106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Transcriptional regulation","weight":0.650142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.543986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.514563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.0226131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
