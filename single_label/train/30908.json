{"id":30908,"title":"Looking for the uninsured in Massachusetts? Check opioid dependent persons seeking detoxification.","abstract":"We examined the rate of uninsurance among persons seeking detoxification at a large drug treatment program in Massachusetts in 2013, five years after insurance mandates.We interviewed three hundred and forty opioid dependent persons admitted for inpatient detoxification in Fall River, Massachusetts. Potential predictors of self-reported insurance status included age, gender, ethnicity, employment, homelessness, years of education, current legal status, and self-perceived health status.Participants mean age was 32 years, 71% were male, and 87% were non-Hispanic Caucasian. Twenty-three percent were uninsured. In the multivariate model, the odds of being uninsured was positively associated with years of education (OR=1.22, 95% CI=1.03; 1.46, p<.05), higher among males than females (OR=2.63, 95% CI=1.33; 5.20, p<.01), and inversely associated with age (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.90; 0.98, p<.01).Opioid dependent persons recruited from a detoxification program in Massachusetts are uninsured at rates far above the state average. With the arrival of the Affordable Care Act, drug treatment programs in Massachusetts and nationally will be important sites to target to expand health coverage.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438841","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.757598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.601239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.374307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.357169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.326494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.318918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.310988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.28382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Autumn","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn"},{"name":"Fall River, Massachusetts","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_River,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Opioid dependence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_dependence"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Purification Rundown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_Rundown"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Status (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_(law)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mandate (politics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_(politics)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"}]}
