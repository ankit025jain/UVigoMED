{"id":76835,"title":"Comparative study on laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic gastric bypass for treatment of morbid obesity patients.","abstract":"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is one of the most widely used bariatric procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a relatively innovative procedure which has been increasingly accepted as a sole bariatric procedure in the Asian-Pacific region. This study aims to compare mid-term outcomes in morbid obesity patients undergoing LRYGB and LSG.Between January 2008 and May 2011, 94 morbid obesity patients were assigned by patient choice after informed consent to either a LSG (n = 56) or LRYGB (n = 38) group. We compared operation time, amount of bleeding, hospital length-of-stay, complications, improvement of diabetic patients, BMI, and excess weight loss (EWL) at 6-30 months post-operation.There was no death in either group. The operating time, hospital length-of-stay, and complications were significantly shorter in the LSG group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the overall improvement of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05). LRYGB had better effectiveness than LSG in BMI decrease and EWL in the first year (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference after 1 year (P > 0.05).The two procedures are safe and effective, but the LRYGB procedure incurs a high number of complications and long hospital stay. LSG is a promising bariatric procedure and the results of LSG as a single procedure are equally effective to LRYGB at 2 years follow-up on weight reduction. Furthermore, the LSG group has a more stable EWL in the early stage. However, studies with large number of patients and longer follow-up are necessary to make a definitive conclusions.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901132","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.845535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.719152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Sleeve gastrectomy","weight":0.71283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve_gastrectomy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.68779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.372605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.17046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0376342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"LSG","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSG"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sleeve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
