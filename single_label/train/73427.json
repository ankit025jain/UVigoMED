{"id":73427,"title":"Radiological and pathological characteristics of giant cell tumor of bone treated with denosumab.","abstract":"We describe a case of giant cell tumor of the proximal tibia with skip bone metastases of the ipsilateral femur in a 20-year-old man. After the neoadjuvant treatment with denosumab, plain radiographs and computed tomography showed marked osteosclerosis and sclerotic rim formation, and 18F-FDG PET/CT showed a decreased standardized uptake value, whereas magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse enhancement of the tumor, nearly the same findings as those at pretreatment. Pathological findings of the surgical specimen after the denosumab treatment showed benign fibrous histiocytoma-like features with complete disappearance of both mononuclear stromal cells and multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1090602085125068.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906559","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.85059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.422733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.400029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.224559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ipsilateral","weight":0.0482972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsilateral"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Osteosclerosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosclerosis"},{"name":"Giant-cell tumor of bone","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-cell_tumor_of_bone"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"}]}
