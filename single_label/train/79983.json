{"id":79983,"title":"6-trifluoromethyl-2-thiouracil possesses anti-Toxoplasma gondii effect in vitro and in vivo with low hepatotoxicity.","abstract":"Since pyrimethamine, the general therapeutic drug for toxoplasmosis, presents several adverse side effects, the need to develop and evaluate new drugs for the condition is critical. In this study, anti-Toxoplasma gondii activities of 3-[{2-((E)-furan-2-ylmethylene)hydrazinyl}methylene]-1,3-dihydroindol-2-one (ATT-5126) and 6-trifluoromethyl-2-thiouracil (KH-0562) were evaluated in vitro using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay and in vivo by measuring amount of the tachyzoites in mice ascites. Biochemical parameters such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also evaluated in livers of mice at 4 days post-infection. As a result, the ATT-5126 and KH-0562 showed anti-T. gondii activity in vitro. Treatment of ATT-5126 or KH-0562 decreased the amount of tachyzoites in T. gondii infected ICR mice. The relative weight of liver and spleen increased by T. gondii infection were decreased by treatment of ATT-5126 or KH-0562. The levels of LPO, ALT and AST, which are biochemical parameters involved in liver injury, were also significantly recovered by treatment of ATT-5126 or KH-0562 (p<0.05). In particular, the recovered levels by KH-0562 were similar to those of pyrimethamine-treated group (p<0.05). However, the level of GSH, which is an antioxidant indicator, showed insignificant statistics. The results suggest that KH-0562 show anti-T. gondii activities in vitro and in vivo with low hepatotoxicity. Therefore, KH-0562 may be a useful candidate for treating T. gondii infection.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830752","annotations":[{"name":"Toxoplasmosis","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.837309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Pyrimethamine","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimethamine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.661313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.488187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Potassium hydroxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Redox indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_indicator"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
