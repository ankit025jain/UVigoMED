{"id":41142,"title":"[Clinical study of tissue-selecting therapy in the treatment of mixed hemorrhoids: a single-blind randomized controlled trail].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of tissue-selecting therapy (TST) in treatment of mixed hemorrhoids.A single-blind randomized study was carried out. A total of 120 patients with mixed hemorrhoids from January to December 2012 were prospectively enrolled in the study and equally divided into two groups, TST group and procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids(PPH) group. Surgical data, efficacy and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.As compared to PPH group, patients in TST group had shorter operation time [(15.9±5.18) min vs. (22.6±7.1) min, P<0.05], lower scores of rectal urgency (0.5±0.2 vs. 1.5±1.4, P<0.05), and shorter hospital stay [(11.2±3.7) d vs. (14.8±3.7) d, P<0.05]. No anastomotic stricture case was found in TST group, while 11 cases(18.3%) developed anastomotic stricture in PPH group. There were no significant differences in effective rate and pain score of first defecation between the two groups.TST is reliable and safe for mixed hemorrhoids with the advantage of simple, rapid recovery and less complications.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953368","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.566711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.242092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Hemorrhoid","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.198552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"}]}
