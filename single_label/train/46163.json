{"id":46163,"title":"Calotropin: a cardenolide from calotropis gigantea that inhibits Wnt signaling by increasing casein kinase 1? in colon cancer cells.","abstract":"Wnt signaling plays key roles in embryonic development and various human diseases. Activity-guided testing to isolate Wnt signaling inhibitors from the methanol extract of Calotropis gigantea (Asclepiadaceae) exudutes identified six Wnt inhibitory cardenolides (1-6), of which 1, 3, 5, and 6 exhibited potent TCF/?-catenin inhibitory activities (IC50 0.7-3.6 nM). Calotropin (1) inhibited Wnt signaling by decreasing both nuclear and cytosolic ?-catenin in a dose-dependent manner, and promoted degradation of ?-catenin by increasing the phosphorylation of ?-catenin at Ser45 through casein kinase 1? (CK1?). Moreover, 1 significantly increased CK1? protein and mRNA levels. The results suggest that 1 inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by increasing CK1? protein levels. To the best of our knowledge, calotropin is the first small molecule to increase CK1? levels.
