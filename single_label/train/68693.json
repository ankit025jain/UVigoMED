{"id":68693,"title":"Prostate cancer as a paradigm of multidisciplinary approach? Highlights from the Italian young radiation oncologist meeting.","abstract":"The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to prostate cancer has evolved rapidly in last decades. Young professionals need an update about these recent developments in order to improve the care of patients treated in their daily clinical practice.On May 18, 2013, AIRO Giovani (the young section of the Italian Association of Radiation Oncology) organized a multidisciplinary meeting involving, as speakers, several young physicians from many parts of Italy actively involved in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to prostate cancer. The meeting was specifically addressed to young physicians (radio-oncologists, urologists, medical oncologists) and presented the state-of-the-art of the diagnostic/therapeutic approach based on the latest evidence on the issue. Highlights of the congress are summarized and presented in this report.The large participation in the meeting (more than 120 participants were present) confirmed the interest of young radiation oncologists in improving their skills in prostate cancer management. The contributions of the speakers confirmed the need for regular updates, considering the promising results of recently published studies and the many new ongoing trials, on the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to prostate cancer.Multidisciplinary meetings are helpful to improve the skills of young professionals.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503785","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.72031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.523877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Radiation oncologist","weight":0.422593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_oncologist"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"United States Congress","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Adaptive radiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation"},{"name":"May 18","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_18"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"}]}
