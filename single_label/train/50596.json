{"id":50596,"title":"Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity in experimental hyperthyroidism and its correction.","abstract":"We demonstrate changes in cellular and humoral immunity in animals with experimental hyperthyroidism induced by chronic administration of potassium iodide (KI) solution. KI increased the weight and cellularity of the thymus and spleen and number of antibody-forming cells to sheep red blood cells and modified the relative content of T cell subpopulations. Phytosorption complex LimfoFit modifying cellular and humoral immunity affected only its individual parameters in hyperthyroid animals.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771430","annotations":[{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.826664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.798571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.711885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Potassium iodide","weight":0.653328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_iodide"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.402349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.278888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
