{"id":91634,"title":"Pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention: can they be cost-effective?","abstract":"We sought to determine the target populations and drug efficacy, toxicity, cost, and initiation age thresholds under which a pharmacologic regimen for knee osteoarthritis (OA) prevention could be cost-effective.We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated state-transition simulation model of knee OA, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) as prophylaxis for the disease. We assessed four cohorts at varying risk for developing OA: (1) no risk factors, (2) obese, (3) history of knee injury, and (4) high-risk (obese with history of knee injury). The base case DMOAD was initiated at age 50 with 40% efficacy in the first year, 5% failure per subsequent year, 0.22% major toxicity, and annual cost of $1,000. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Key parameters were varied in sensitivity analyses.For the high-risk cohort, base case prophylaxis increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.04 and lifetime costs by $4,600, and produced an ICER of $118,000 per QALY gained. ICERs >$150,000/QALY were observed when comparing the base case DMOAD to the standard of care in the knee injury only cohort; for the obese only and no risk factors cohorts, the base case DMOAD was less cost-effective than the standard of care. Regimens priced at $3,000 per year and higher demonstrated ICERs above cost-effectiveness thresholds consistent with current US standards.The cost-effectiveness of DMOADs for OA prevention for persons at high risk for incident OA may be comparable to other accepted preventive therapies.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487044","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.892817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.727159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.585621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.582909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.57488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.197271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.150375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"ICER","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICER"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Key (company)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(company)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Recursion (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Population dynamics of fisheries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics_of_fisheries"},{"name":"Knee osteoarthritis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
