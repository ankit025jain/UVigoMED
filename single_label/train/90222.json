{"id":90222,"title":"Sliding fibular graft repair for the treatment of recurrent peroneal subluxation.","abstract":"Because recurrent peroneal subluxation can produce functional impairment in athletes, most authors suggest operative intervention for patients who fail nonoperative treatment. The present report introduces the modified sliding fibular graft repair for this pathology.This retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical results for 26 patients with recurrent peroneal subluxation who underwent this procedure with a follow-up of a minimum of 3 years.Intraoperative observations revealed 15 convex grooves and 11 shallow sulci with a low-lying peroneus brevis muscle belly in 6 patients and a peroneus quartus muscle in 4 patients. All underwent the procedure plus excision of redundant muscle and tendon repair, with an improvement rate of 88.5% according to American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score at the final visit. All but 3 patients returned to normal function in 4.4 months with no infection, nonunion, or intra-articular screw placement. A total of 8 patients had minor complications including neurapraxia, synovitis, stress fracture, and delayed union.We found that an anomalous fibular groove plus tendon variants could lead to a further decrease in the volume of the osteofibrous tunnel and might be the reason for recurrent peroneal dislocation; thus, our modified procedure may be a reasonable treatment for this pathological malposition. We found less functional recovery in aged patients due to a higher incidence of tendon tear and postoperative complications.Level III, retrospective comparative
