{"id":90759,"title":"[Unrecognised dissociation of the bipolar hip prosthesis Avantage® (Biomet®) after closed reduction of a dislocation: a rare complication].","abstract":"An 84-year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency department with a periprosthetic fracture of the left femur with an implanted Avantage prosthesis (Biomet®). Conventional X-ray images revealed besides the fracture a lateralisation of the prosthesis stem. An additional CT scan showed a dissociation of the polyethylene inlay from the head of the prosthesis which took place 3 years ago in the course of a closed reposition of a postoperative luxation. This event shows the relevance of a precise analysis of X-ray images after reposition regarding the exact articulation of the different prosthesis components.
