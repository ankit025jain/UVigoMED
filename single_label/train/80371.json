{"id":80371,"title":"Update on immunologic and molecular diagnosis of human strongyloidiasis.","abstract":"Human strongyloidiasis is an intestinal parasitosis that may affect 100 million individuals. However, the prevalence rates of this infection may represent smaller values than the actual data, mainly due to difficulties in its diagnosis. The aim of this study was to update the immunological and molecular methods applied to the diagnosis of human strongyloidiasis. There is a great diversity of techniques used in the diagnosis of this parasitosis, such as immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting, luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS), dispstick and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), all with advantages and disadvantages, and with unique features for specific purposes. Considering the magnitude of strongyloidiasis and the importance of early diagnosis, due to the possibility of chronicity and hyperinfection, this study analyzes the different methods currently employed, and demonstrates the necessity of developing innovative methodologies, which also maintain diagnostic accuracy, particularly for regions with limited technological resources.
