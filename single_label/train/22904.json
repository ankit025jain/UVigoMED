{"id":22904,"title":"Metallic implant drug/device combinations for controlled drug release in orthopaedic applications.","abstract":"The study of metallic drug/device combinations for controlled drug release in orthopaedic applications has gained significant momentum in the past decade, particularly for the prevention and reduction of implant associated infection. Such combinations are commonly based upon a permanent metallic implant (such as stainless steel or titanium) and are then coated with a drug-eluting polymer or ceramic system. Drug elution is also possible from the implant itself by utilising metallic foams, porous architectures and bioresorbable metals. This review will explore the current research into metallic implant drug/device combinations via a critical review of the relevant literature.
