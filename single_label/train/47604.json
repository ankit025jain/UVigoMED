{"id":47604,"title":"Transarterial treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases with irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads: technical recommendations.","abstract":"Transcatheter hepatic arterial administration of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) is used to treat liver-only or liver-dominant metastatic disease from colorectal cancer (CRC). Eligibility for DEBIRI should be established in each individual patient by a multidisciplinary team based on comprehensive clinical, imaging, and laboratory assessment. Standardization of DEBIRI technique and protocols would be expected to lead to improved efficacy and safety. The present article provides a set of technical recommendations for the use of DEBIRI in the treatment of hepatic CRC metastases.
