{"id":85735,"title":"Monascin attenuates oxidative stress-mediated lung inflammation via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-?) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2) modulation.","abstract":"We speculated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-? agonists may modulate the oxidative stress pathway to ameliorate the development of airway inflammation. The effect of Monascus-fermented metabolite monascin (MS) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) on oxidative stress-induced lung inflammation was evaluated. Luciferase assay and DNA binding activity assay were used to point out that MS may be a novel PPAR-? agonist and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2) activator. We used hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce inflammation in lung epithelial cells. MS and Rosi prevented H2O2-induced ROS generation in A549 epithelial cells through PPAR-? translocation, avoiding inflammatory mediator expression via inhibiting nuclear factor (NF)-?B translocation. The regulatory ability of MS was abolished by siRNA against PPAR-?. MS also elevated antioxidant enzyme expression via Nrf-2 activation. Both PPAR-? and Nrf-2 might have benefits against lung inflammation. MS regulated PPAR-? and Nrf-2 to improve lung oxidative inflammation.
