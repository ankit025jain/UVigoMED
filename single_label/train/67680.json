{"id":67680,"title":"Development and evaluation of an articulated registration algorithm for human skeleton registration.","abstract":"Accurate registration over multiple scans is necessary to assess treatment response of bone diseases (e.g. metastatic bone lesions). This study aimed to develop and evaluate an articulated registration algorithm for the whole-body skeleton registration in human patients. In articulated registration, whole-body skeletons are registered by auto-segmenting into individual bones using atlas-based segmentation, and then rigidly aligning them. Sixteen patients (weight = 80-117 kg, height = 168-191 cm) with advanced prostate cancer underwent the pre- and mid-treatment PET/CT scans over a course of cancer therapy. Skeletons were extracted from the CT images by thresholding (HU>150). Skeletons were registered using the articulated, rigid, and deformable registration algorithms to account for position and postural variability between scans. The inter-observers agreement in the atlas creation, the agreement between the manually and atlas-based segmented bones, and the registration performances of all three registration algorithms were all assessed using the Dice similarity index-DSIobserved, DSIatlas, and DSIregister. Hausdorff distance (dHausdorff) of the registered skeletons was also used for registration evaluation. Nearly negligible inter-observers variability was found in the bone atlases creation as the DSIobserver was 96 ± 2%. Atlas-based and manual segmented bones were in excellent agreement with DSIatlas of 90 ± 3%. Articulated (DSIregsiter = 75 ± 2%, dHausdorff = 0.37 ± 0.08 cm) and deformable registration algorithms (DSIregister = 77 ± 3%, dHausdorff = 0.34 ± 0.08 cm) considerably outperformed the rigid registration algorithm (DSIregsiter = 59 ± 9%, dHausdorff = 0.69 ± 0.20 cm) in the skeleton registration as the rigid registration algorithm failed to capture the skeleton flexibility in the joints. Despite superior skeleton registration performance, deformable registration algorithm failed to preserve the local rigidity of bones as over 60% of the skeletons were deformed. Articulated registration is superior to rigid and deformable registrations by capturing global flexibility while preserving local rigidity inherent in skeleton registration. Therefore, articulated registration can be employed to accurately register the whole-body human skeletons, and it enables the treatment response assessment of various bone diseases.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594843","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.691236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.619339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.565305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.528512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.316682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.287174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Human skeleton","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skeleton"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Kiowa, Colorado","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiowa,_Colorado"},{"name":"Hausdorff distance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Flexibility (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Bone disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_disease"},{"name":"Atlas","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas"},{"name":"Hausdorff space","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Negligible","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Thresholding (image processing)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)"}]}
