{"id":80499,"title":"[Malaria alertness in the post-elimination period: clinical and laboratory aspects].","abstract":"Early detection of imported cases of malaria and its prompt and efficacious treatment are one of the main tasks of health workers in malaria prevention during the post-elimination period. The diagnosis and treatment of malaria should be developed and standardized to prevent the re-emergence of local transmission from imported cases of malaria. Its diagnosis must be verified by only laboratory tests during the post-elimination period. Keeping in mind the possible rapid conversion of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria into a several disease, these all cases should be managed in a hospital setting. The healthcare personnel dealing with the treatment of malaria should be aware of its clinical manifestations in non-immune residents and semi-immune immigrants. The main principles of malaria treatment are discussed in respect of age, sex, pregnancy, and different malaria species.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640124","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.777841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.444527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Health Human Resources","weight":0.403699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Human_Resources"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.379429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.327694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.150999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Alertness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alertness"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
