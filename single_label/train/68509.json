{"id":68509,"title":"Are there specific health-related factors that can accentuate the risk of suicide among men with prostate cancer?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to explore if there were some specific factors pertinent to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that could affect self-experienced suicide ideation in men with prostate cancer (PCa).Questionnaires containing 45 items were distributed to members of the Swedish Prostate Cancer Federation in May 2012. Out of 6,400 distributed questionnaires, 3,165 members (50 %) with PCa completed the questionnaires. Those members expressed their experienced HRQoL and experienced suicide ideation using VAS-like scales as well as multiple-choice questions. Both descriptive and analytical statistical methods were employed. A regression model was used to explore the relationship between experienced health-related quality of life and experienced suicide ideation.Generally, the respondents rated their self-experienced health-related quality of life as good. About 40 % of the participants had experienced problem with incontinence, and 23 % had obstructions during miction. About 7 % of the respondents experienced suicidal ideation, at least sometime. The regression model showed statistically significant relationships between suicide ideation, on the one hand, and lower self-rated health-related quality of life (P?<?0.001), physical pain (P?=?0.04), pain during miction (P?=?0.03), and low-rated mental?/?physical energy (P?=?0.03), on the other.It is quite necessary to know which specific disease and treatment-related problems can trigger suicide ideations in men with prostate cancer and to try to direct treatment, care, and psychosocial resources to alleviate these problems in time.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515278","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.599351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.545374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.204446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.0629808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
