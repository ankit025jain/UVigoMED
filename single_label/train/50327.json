{"id":50327,"title":"Lowering dietary glycaemic index through nutrition education among Malaysian women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Low glycaemic index (GI) diets improve cardio-metabolic outcomes in insulin-resistant individuals. We examined the feasibility of lowering GI through GI-based-education among Asian post-GDM women.A 3-month investigation was carried out on 60 Malaysian women with a mean age of 31.0 +/- 4.5 years and a history of GDM. Subjects were randomised into two groups: LGIE and CHDR. The CHDR group received conventional healthy dietary recommendations only. The LGIE group received GI based-education in addition to conventional healthy dietary recommendations. At baseline and after 3-months, dietary intake of energy and macronutrient intakes including GI diet and glycaemic load was assessed using 3-day food records. Diabetes-Diet and GI-concept scores and physical activity levels were assessed using a questionnaire. Adherence to dietary instructions was measured at the end of 3 months.At the end of 3 months, the LGIE group had significant reductions in energy intake (241.7 +/- 522.4Kcal, P = 0.037, ES=0.463), total carbohydrate (48.7 +/- 83.5g, P = 0.010, ES = 0.583), GI (3.9 +/- 7.1, P = 0.017, ES = 0.549) and GL (39.0 +/- 55.3, P = 0.003, ES = 0.705) and significant increases in protein (3.7 +/- 5.4g, 0.003, ES = 0.685) and diet fibre (4.6 +/- 7.3g, P = 0.06). The CHDR group had a significant reduction in fat only (5.7 +/- 9.4g, P = 0.006, ES = 0.606). There was a 30% increase in GI-concept scores in the LGIE group (p < 0.001). Changes in GI-concept scores correlated significantly to the reduction in dietary GI (r = -0.642, P = 0.045). Dietary adherence was comparable in both groups.GI-education improves GI-concept knowledge and helps lower dietary glycaemic index among women with a history of GDM.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800381","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.388614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.24872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.119376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"History","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Greenland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
