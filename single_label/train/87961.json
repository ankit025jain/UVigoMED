{"id":87961,"title":"Abdominal injuries after high falls: high incidence and increased mortality.","abstract":"Falls from height are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Injuries to the extremities and head are common. However, little has been reported on abdominal injuries or their treatment. This study aims to assess the abdominal injuries, treatment, and mortality after falls from height.We searched our hospital's Trauma registry from January 2004 through December 2007 and identified all patients who fell from five meters or higher. Additional data was extracted from medical records, radiology reports, and operation reports.One hundred and thirty-nine patients (median age 31 years) were included. There were 106 men and 33 women. Forty-one patients had abdominal injuries. Thirteen patients had a retroperitoneal hematoma, eleven had a liver laceration, nine had a kidney laceration, and eight had a spleen laceration. Eleven patients required emergency laparotomy and/or endovascular stenting or coiling to stop the bleeding. Patients with abdominal injuries had a tenfold higher mortality than those without abdominal injuries (19.5% versus 2.0%).Abdominal injuries were common and associated with a tenfold increase in mortality.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941711","annotations":[{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.796422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Laceration","weight":0.740786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laceration"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.605816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.487806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.482128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.266588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Guglielmi Detachable Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmi_Detachable_Coil"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
