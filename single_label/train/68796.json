{"id":68796,"title":"[Survey on common pediatric drugs for renal diseases].","abstract":"Development and use of better medicine for children is a worldwide problem recently, especially in China. The current situation of drugs for children's renal diseases is far from well-understood now. This survey focused on drugs for pediatric renal diseases including immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, diuretics, anticoagulants, hypotensives and antilipemic agents.Information regarding the dosage, form, precaution, usage and administration in inserts was collected in this study.Drugs for pediatric renal diseases were selected according to the guidelines established by the Chinese Society of Pediatric Nephrology. The detailed information about the dosage, form of drugs was searched on the website of China-State Food and Drug (SFDA). The information of the precaution, usage and administration was obtained from the China Pharmaceutical Reference, the first edition.In this study, there were 5 categories of medicine including immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, diuretics, anticoagulants, hypotensives and antilipemic agents, and 89 kinds of medicine for renal diseases. Among these medicines, 65.2% were found not suitable for children in terms of drug dosage and form, 19.1% did not indicate the precaution, 51.7% did not indicate clearly the safety and effectiveness for children, and 56.2% lacked the detailed information about the usage and administration for children. There were only 4 kinds of these medicines which were studied via clinical trials in children population.There is a lack of drugs for children with renal diseases. Most of the time, the medicines used by doctors are not specially manufactured for children. The safety and efficacy of drugs that are currently used to treat pediatric renal diseases are not clear and definite.In addition, few clinical trials have been conducted for evaluation of drugs for pediatric renal diseases.In clinic, the situation of off-label drug treatment is very serious.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495757","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.739536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.738517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.655844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.594605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.593279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.568837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"China","weight":0.566115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Hypolipidemic agent","weight":0.545106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypolipidemic_agent"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.484367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.460502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
