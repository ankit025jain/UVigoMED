{"id":33604,"title":"A study to assess the occlusivity and moisturization potential of three topical corticosteroid products using the skin trauma after razor shaving (STARS) bioassay.","abstract":"Dysfunction of the epidermal barrier is generally considered a precursor of cutaneous inflammation that can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of skin diseases, notably atopic dermatitis (AD). We also know that topical corticosteroids may actually impair the epidermal barrier by interfering with epidermal lipid synthesis. Therefore, it is important to utilize topical corticosteroids in vehicles that will help at least to enhance the already disrupted epidermal barrier in atopic dermatitis patients. Two studies of identical design were conducted to determine and compare the occlusivity and moisturizing potential of three topical corticosteroid products when applied to skin whose barrier integrity has been disrupted by dry shaving. Findings in both studies showed the clocortolone pivalate cream decreased TEWL better than non-treatment or treatment with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. Skin surface hydration increased significantly (P<0.001) in all three treated sites, compared to the non-treated damaged control and non-treated normal skin. Clocortolone pivalate cream increased skin surface hydration significantly (P<0.001) better than hydrocortisone butyrate lipocream or hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. These studies showed that clocortolone pivalate cream enhances barrier function by providing occlusion. While understanding of the structure and function of the stratum corneum (SC) and epidermal barrier function has evolved tremendously over the last several decades, and especially over the last 15 years,1 confusion and misinformation still persist. Dysfunction of the epidermal barrier is generally considered a precursor of cutaneous inflammation that can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of skin diseases, notably atopic dermatitis (AD).2,3 Topical steroids are standard of care in treatment of atopic dermatitis. However, we also know that topical corticosteroids may actually impair epidermal barrier by interfering with epidermal lipid synthesis.4,5 In addition to that, various penetration enhancers in the topical steroid formulations also contribute to the impairment of the epidermal barrier.4 Therefore, it is important to utilize topical corticosteroids in vehicles that will help at least to enhance the already disrupted epidermal barrier in atopic dermatitis patients. In this regard, these studies were designed to determine the hydrating effects of clocortolone pivalate cream 0.1% (Cloderm Cream, Promius Pharma).","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Congenital
