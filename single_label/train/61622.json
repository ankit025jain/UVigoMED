{"id":61622,"title":"Evaluation of diffusion-weighted MRI for pretherapeutic assessment and staging of lymphoma: results of a prospective study in 140 patients.","abstract":"To determine the value of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) for pretherapeutic imaging of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymphoma and lymphoma with variable FDG avidity.Treatment-na√Øve patients with lymphoma who were referred for whole-body staging were included in this prospective study. Group A included patients with FDG-avid lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin, diffuse large B-cell, and follicular lymphoma), whereas Group B included patients with lymphoma of variable FDG avidity [e.g., extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)]. All patients underwent DWI-MRI and 18F-FDG- positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Region-based sensitivity and agreement with Ann Arbor staging, relative to the reference standard, were calculated for DWI-MRI, and, in Group B, also 18F-FDG-PET/CT and contrast-enhanced (CE-) CT.In Group A (100 patients), DWI-MRI had a region-based sensitivity of 97%, and with regard to staging, agreed with the reference standard in 94 of 100 patients (?, 0.92). In Group B (40 patients; 38 MALT lymphomas and 2 small lymphocytic lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukemias), DWI-MRI, 18F-FDG-PET/CT, and CE-CT had region-based sensitivities of 94.4%, 60.9%, and 70.7%, respectively. With regard to staging in Group B, DWI-MRI, 18F-FDG-PET/CT, and CE-CT agreed with the reference standard in 37 of 40, 26 of 40, and 24 of 40 patients, with ? values of 0.89, 0.52, and 0.43, respectively.In patients with FDG-avid lymphoma, DWI-MRI seems to be only slightly inferior to 18F-FDG-PET/CT with regard to pretherapeutic regional assessment and staging. In patients with lymphoma subtypes that show a variable FDG avidity (e.g., MALT lymphoma), DWI-MRI seems to be superior to both 18F-FDG-PET/CT and CE-CT.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696320","annotations":[{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"MALT lymphoma","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALT_lymphoma"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ann Arbor staging","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor_staging"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.757745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.699052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.549242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Marginal zone","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_zone"},{"name":"Lymphoid tissue","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.211135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Avidity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidity"}]}
