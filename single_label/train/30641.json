{"id":30641,"title":"[Adverse drug reactions case reports for parenterally administered shuxuening based on analysis of literature].","abstract":"Parenterally administered Shuxuening had made important contributions in the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases since its use in 1995. Parenterally administered Shuxuening is widely used in clinical practice hence concern over its safety has gradually arisen. Based on published adverse drug reaction (ADR) case reports, this article analyzes cpatient characteristics and other data including: gender, age, history of allergies, primary disease, dose, treatment course, solvent, ADR occurrence and time scales. This will provide a clinical reference regarding ADRs to parenterally administered Shuxuening and influencing factors on their occurrence. Analysis showed that ADRs clinical symptoms include systemic damage, with damage to the skin, mucous membranes and respiratory system most common. ADRs occurred earliest after 1 minute of infusion, and after the 11th day at the latest. 70% cases of ADR occurred within 1 hour, therefore rapid occurrence is a primary clinical characteristic. The medication was largely used in accordance with the drug manual, and of the association of ADRs with allergies or different drug combination was not high. The occurrence of ADRs may not be entirely associated with the drug but the solvent used in its manufacture may be an important factor.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471350","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.739852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.693124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.547778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.355686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
