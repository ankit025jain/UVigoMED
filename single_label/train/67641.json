{"id":67641,"title":"Concurrent urothelial carcinoma in the renal pelvis of an allograft kidney and native recipient bladder: evidence of donor origin.","abstract":"A 44-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for asymptomatic gross hematuria. At the age of 28, she underwent transplantation of a kidney from her father for end-stage renal disease secondary to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. She resumed peritoneal dialysis when the allograft kidney stopped functioning at the age of 42. Dialysis was continued for the next 2 years, when the hematuria occurred and she was readmitted. Radiologic evaluation and transurethral resection of the bladder tumor revealed a tumor of the renal pelvis of the allograft kidney (cT3N0M0) and multiple bladder tumors (cT1N0M0). Total cystectomy and allograft nephroureterectomy were performed. Histopathological examinations revealed high grade urothelial carcinoma in the renal pelvis of the allograft kidney (pT3) and native bladder (pT1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization of both specimens demonstrated that the renal pelvic tumors and bladder cancer possessed XY karyotypes. These results indicated that the urothelial carcinoma developed de novo in the renal pelvis of the allograft kidney and was implanted into the recipient's native bladder.
