{"id":77319,"title":"[Some aspects of cognitive functions in chronic intoxication by organic solvents].","abstract":"Study covered 20 females with chronic intoxication with organic solvents, who worked long as painters on industrial enterprise. To reveal clinically significant cognitive disorders, Mini-Cog scale was applied. Drawing test helped to reveal visual and spatial disorders, restults were expressed in scores. Memory was evaluated through methods \"operative memory\", \"short-term memory\", \"memory for figures\", \"memory for images\", \"hearing memory\"--that proved lower results in the main group of examinees. In 75% of patients with occupational diseases caused by organic solvents, moderate cognitive disorders of amnestic multifunctional type were seen. 100% of individuals having chronic intoxication with organic solvents demonstrated encephalopathy. In comparison with reference group, the main group members had more frequent 1 and 2 degrees encephalopahy.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073348","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Amnesia","weight":0.721475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.300978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.241186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.239594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Painting","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.184596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.0595871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Multifunction printer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"}]}
