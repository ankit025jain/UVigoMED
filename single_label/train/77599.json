{"id":77599,"title":"State of the art: Imaging of occupational lung disease.","abstract":"Imaging of occupational lung disease, often perceived as a static discipline, continues to evolve with changes in industry and imaging technology. The challenge of accurately identifying an occupational exposure as the cause of lung disease demands a team approach, requiring integration of imaging features with exposure type, time course, and severity. Increasing use of computed tomography has demonstrated that specific occupational exposures can result in a variety of patterns of lung injury. The radiologist must understand the spectrum of expected imaging patterns related to known occupational exposures and must also recognize newly described occupational exposure risks, often related to recent changes in industrial practices.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568704","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.572668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.359703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Occupational lung disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_lung_disease"},{"name":"Discipline","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Holotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Industrial agriculture (animals)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_agriculture_(animals)"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"State of the art","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art"},{"name":"Electrostatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics"}]}
