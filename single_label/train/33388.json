{"id":33388,"title":"Pentology of Fallot's presenting with complete heart block.","abstract":"A 17-year-old male patient presented with cyanosis, repeated squatting since childhood and haemoptysis since the past 1?month. He had central cyanosis with clubbing. Cardiovasular examination revealed ejection systolic murmur in the pulmonary area with single S2. ECG showed right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) with right atrial enlargement and first-degree heart block. Two-dimensional echo showed ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, RVH, right ventricular enlargement (RVE) and right atrial enlargement with infundibular and valvular pulmonary stenosis and 1.9?cm ostium secondum atrial septal defect. There was no evidence of atrioventricular canal defect. The patient was diagnosed with pentology of Fallots. Follow-up ECG showed complete heart block (CHB) that again reverted to first-degree heart block. A diagnosis of pentology of Fallot with intermittent CHB was made with an awake heart rate of 50/min. This case report shows association of CHB with tetralogy of Fallot.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832712","annotations":[{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Pulmonic stenosis","weight":0.889213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonic_stenosis"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Right ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Heart block","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_block"},{"name":"Overriding aorta","weight":0.807432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overriding_aorta"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Atrioventricular node","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_node"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.602375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.574094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Heart murmur","weight":0.535017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_murmur"},{"name":"Nail clubbing","weight":0.504964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_clubbing"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.491951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.477085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.344669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Atrioventricular canal","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_canal"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Third-degree atrioventricular block","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-degree_atrioventricular_block"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Primary interatrial foramen","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_interatrial_foramen"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"}]}
