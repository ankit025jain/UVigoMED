{"id":20130,"title":"The development of antimicrobial a-AApeptides that suppress proinflammatory immune responses.","abstract":"Herein we describe the development of a new class of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory peptidomimetics: cyclic lipo-?-AApeptides. They have potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens, including both multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fluorescence microscopy suggests that cyclic lipo-?-AApeptides kill bacteria by disrupting bacterial membranes, possibly through a mechanism similar to that of cationic host-defense peptides (HDPs). Furthermore, the cyclic lipo-?-AApeptide can mimic cationic host-defense peptides by antagonizing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling responses and suppressing proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?). Our results suggest that by mimicking HDPs, cyclic lipo-?-AApeptides could emerge as a new class of antibiotic agents that directly kill bacteria, as well as novel antiinflammatory agents that act through immunomodulation.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677440","annotations":[{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.717209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.590093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"TLR 4","weight":0.580699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_4"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.468006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.434501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Cationic","weight":0.343501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cationic"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.321863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.224121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"}]}
