{"id":44665,"title":"Clinically severe portal hypertension: role of multi-detector row CT features in diagnosis.","abstract":"To explore the CT signs which permit estimation of clinically severe portal hypertension (PH) [? 12 of hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG)].One-hundred and seven consecutive patients who underwent HVPG measurement in the PH group and 52 controls were included. The diameters of main portal vein (øMPV), superior mesenteric vein (øSMV), splenic vein (øSV), and left gastric vein, øMPV/øSV, øSMV/øSV, as well as estimated spleen volumes were evaluated on the CT scan. The grade of varix and ascites were also evaluated semi-quantitatively. We explored the statistically significant CT features related to severe PH and performed a logistic regression analysis for an estimation model for severe PH.øMPV/øSV and øSMV/øSV tended to gradually increase as the PH became severer, and the difference between severe and not severe groups was statistically significant (p = 0.015 and 0.038, respectively). According to the regression analysis, øSMV/øSV and the grade of esophageal varix and ascites were finally included as related variables for predicting severe PH. The odds ratio (OR) of øSMV/øSV was 4.596, and large esophageal varix (OR 4.135) and mild (OR 3.051) and large amount of ascites (OR 21.781) were statistically significantly related to severe PH.Changing diameters of portal system, the grades of esophageal varices and ascites on multi-detector row computed tomography might be indicative features for clinically severe PH.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723070","annotations":[{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Splenic vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenic_vein"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.793617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric vein","weight":0.698475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_vein"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Portal venous system","weight":0.621685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_venous_system"},{"name":"Left gastric vein","weight":0.525588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_gastric_vein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.366443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.0467462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Left gastric artery","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_gastric_artery"}]}
