{"id":92697,"title":"Topical photodynamic therapy of actinic keratoses with 5-aminolevulinic acid: randomized controlled trial with six months follow-up.","abstract":"Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective treatment for actinic keratosis (AK) with some transient adverse events.The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of two different light doses when treating AKs with ALA-PDT on the face/scalp.Thirty-eight patients with two histologically confirmed AKs were enrolled in the within-patient comparison study. ALA-PDT was performed twice with two weeks interval for each AK. Patients were randomized to receive a light dose of 70 or 100?J/cm2 as their first split face/scalp treatment. Follow-up examinations were carried out at months 3 and 6. Efficacy end point included clinical/histological AK clearance rate.No significant difference in therapeutic efficacy and adverse events of ALA-PDT was found between the two light doses at both follow-up visits. At months 3 and 6 after PDT the RATE of complete remission were respectively 100% and 92.1% for 70?J/cm2, 92.1% and 84.2% for 100?J/cm2. The adverse events of the treatment were rosacea 5/76 (6.58%), hyperpigmentation 4/76 (5.26%), hypopigmentation 4/76 (5.26%), transient milia 3/76 (3.95%).The topical ALA-PDT with the red light dose of 70?J/cm2 is an effective treatment for mild and moderate AKs on the face/scalp with expected adverse events of pigmentation changes, rosacea and transient milia.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24215475","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Actinic keratosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinic_keratosis"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Aminolevulinic acid","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminolevulinic_acid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.709475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.59833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Rosacea","weight":0.53628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosacea"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypopigmentation","weight":0.437638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopigmentation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.21786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.109583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"476","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/476"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"Actinism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinism"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Keratosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Alpha-Linolenic acid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid"},{"name":"Milium (disease)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milium_(disease)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clearance rate","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_rate"}]}
