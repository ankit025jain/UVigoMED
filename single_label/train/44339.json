{"id":44339,"title":"Lack of significant elevation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in peripheral blood of chronically hepatitis C virus-infected individuals.","abstract":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are immature myeloid cells with immunosuppressive function. Compared to the level in healthy controls (HC), no elevation of MDSC in chronic hepatitis C (cHEP-C) patients was found, and there was no difference in MDSC based on genotype or viral load (P > 0.25). Moreover, MDSC of cHEP-C patients inhibited CD8 T cell function as efficiently as MDSC of HC did. Since we detected neither quantitative nor qualitative differences in MDSC of cHEP-C patients relative to those of HC, we postulate that MDSC in peripheral blood are most likely not significant regarding immune dysfunction in cHEP-C.
