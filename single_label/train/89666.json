{"id":89666,"title":"[Free vascularized popliteal artery cutaneous branch flap for repair of wound on foot and ankle].","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of free popi iteal artery cutaneous branch flap anastomosed with lateral tarsal artery and vein for the repair of wound on the foot and ankle by anatomical observation and clinical application.Latex was poured into the blood vessels of 8 cadavers, then perforator vessel of posterolateral upper calf was dissected, and the popl iteal artery cutaneous branch flap was designed with a pedicle of 2.5 cm in length; the lateral tarsal artery of the foot was dissected, could be freed to 6 cm in length; the diameter of these vessels was measured, and the number of the accompanying veins was counted. Between March 2010 and January 2013, 13 cases of foot and ankle wounds were repaired with popliteal artery cutaneous branch flap anastomosed with lateral tarsal artery and vein. The size of flaps ranged from 6.0 cm x 4.0 cm to 7.5 cm x 5.5 cm. There were 11 males and 2 females, aged from 41 to 65 years (mean, 47.3 years). The causes of injury included traffic accident in 8 cases, crushing in 4 cases, and twist by machine in 1 case. The size of wounds, ranged from 5.0 cm x 3.5 cm to 7.0 cm x 5.0 cm. The donor sites were sutured directly.According to anatomical observation, the popliteal artery cutaneous branch flap was designed by using the lateral popliteal artery perforator for shaft. The vessel of the pedicle perforator flaps from the popliteal artery cutaneous branch flap matched well with the lateral tarsal artery.vascular crisis occurred in 2 flaps, which survived after symptomatic treatment; the other flaps survived, with primary healing of wound and incision at donor site. The patients were all followed up 5-18 months (mean, 11 months). The flap had normal color and good elasticity. Second stage operation was performed to make the flap thinner in 3 female patients because of bulky flaps. The remaining patients had no obvious fat flap. According to American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score for evaluation of the ankle function at 6 months after operation, the results were excellent in 7 cases, good in 5 cases, and fair in 1 case, with an excellent and good rate of 92.3%.Free popliteal artery cutaneous branch flap anastomosed with lateral tarsal artery and vein for the repair of wound on the foot and ankle is simple and effective. The donor site is hidden.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693787","annotations":[{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.60393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.58743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.366214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.216733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.105376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Calf (anatomy)","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
