{"id":67363,"title":"Calcium channel blockers suppress daily variations of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with end-stage renal diseases.","abstract":"Hypertension is a well-known cardiovascular risk. Patients with end-stage renal diseases frequently suffer hypertension. Furthermore, daily variations of blood pressure are relatively large in patients treated with hemodialysis, partly due to ultrafiltration. Twenty hypertensive patients with end-stage renal diseases whose blood pressure was controlled by a single antihypertensive agent, either angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) or calcium channel blocker (CCB), were enrolled into the study. Home blood pressure measurements were also performed. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar between two agents. However, variations of systolic blood pressure during ARB treatment were greater than those of CCB, and maximal differences in daily systolic blood pressure during treatment with ARB (19±7?mmHg) were greater than those with CCB (14±6?mmHg, p<0.01). Systolic blood pressure measured after hemodialysis under ARB therapy (110±6?mmHg) was lower than that of CCB (118±6?mmHg, p<0.05). Daily variations of diastolic blood pressure were similar between ARB and CCB periods. Our results indicate that variations of systolic blood pressure during ARB treatment are larger than CCB, and suggest that CCB is useful to obtain the better quality of blood pressure control, improving blood pressure stability by preventing substantial drops in blood pressure in hypertensive patients with end-stage renal diseases.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625333","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.800536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Ultrafiltration","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafiltration"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor antagonist","weight":0.762464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.738354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Angiotensin receptor","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_receptor"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood Pressures","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Pressures"}]}
