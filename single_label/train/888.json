{"id":888,"title":"[Beating heart cells--targeted diagnostics, individual optimization of therapy and tailored cell therapies].","abstract":"Myocardial infarction causes scarring and loss of functional capacity of the heart, because the heart is itself unable to repair the damaged area. While the development of new forms of treatment for the repair of myocardial destruction has actually been investigated by introducing into the heart various stem cells present in an adult human, the efficacy of the treatments conducted in the studies has so far unfortunately been low. Embryonic stem cells and iPS cells are a highly significant research subject. Cardiomyocytes differentiated from stem cells are being studied also in drug testing, and they are expected to revolutionize drug development and safety tests of novel drugs as well as enable personalized medication in the future.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558621","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.736049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.621318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.509709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Embryonic stem cell","weight":0.386382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.28316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Human subject research","weight":0.126925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"},{"name":"Assault","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"}]}
