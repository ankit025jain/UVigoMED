{"id":87499,"title":"[Right ventricular rupture due to blunt trauma diagnosed by MDCT; report of a case].","abstract":"The survival rate of cardiac rupture due to blunt trauma is generally low. We experienced a case with right ventricular rupture due to blunt trauma. The patient was a 49-year-old man who was crushed in a traffic accident and transported to a local hospital in a shock state. He was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade due to cardiac rupture, and for pericardial drainage was immediately performed. He was then transferred to our hospital for emergency surgery. His hemodynamics was stable, and he was diagnosed with right ventricular rupture by multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT). The operation was performed successfully without cardiopulmonary bypass, and his postoperative course was uneventful. MDCT is useful for detecting the rupture site of the heart.
