{"id":41897,"title":"Most common HCV genotypes in patients from north-eastern Croatia.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to determine the HCV-RNA viral load, genotype distribution, risk factors and symptoms of HCVRNA positive viral load in HCV antibody-positive patients from north-eastern Croatia.From January 2009 to December 2011, 203 HCV antibody- positive patients (130 men and 73 women; median age 44.5 years) were analyzed for HCV-RNA by the COBAS TaqMan HCV test and genotyped by the Linear Array HCV Genotyping test (both from Roche). All patients completed a structured questionnaire about risk factors and symptoms.The HCV-RNA percentage was 61.1% and was similar for men and women. The HCV-RNA viral load increased with age: while 55% of 20-50 year old patients were HCV-RNA positive, 73% of patients >50 years were positive (p=0.021). Genotype 1 was the most prevalent genotype (79.8%), followed by 3 (12.9%), 4 (6.5%), and 2 (0.8%); genotypes 5 and 6 were not determined. Patients with genotype 1 (median, 50 years) were older than patients with 3 (median, 33.5 years) or 4 (median, 38 years). The blood transfusions performed in Croatian hospitals before 1993 was significantly associated with HCV-RNA positive viral load (p<0.05).These data indicated an elevated prevalence of genotype 1 in elderly HCV-RNA positive patients and it may continue to rise. Using RNA-based detection in HCV positive-antibody patients would allow early detection of HCV in the acute stage of HCV disease and the increased risk of HCV genotyperelated treatment failure.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893634","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.771518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.31207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0250443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_(U.S._Census_Bureau)"},{"name":"2050","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2050"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hoffmann-La Roche","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"}]}
