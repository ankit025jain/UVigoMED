{"id":67298,"title":"A novel photodynamic therapy for drug-resistant prostate cancer cells using porphyrus envelope as a novel photosensitizer.","abstract":"In the clinic, it is often very difficult to treat drug-resistant advanced prostate cancer by conventional treatments. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive treatment that takes advantage of photochemical reactions between a photosensitizer and light. On the basis of several of its key characteristics, PDT is considered to be a promising novel method for treating drug-resistant prostate cancer.For effective treatment of drug-resistant prostate cancer, we developed a novel agent termed porphyrus envelope, which was produced from PpIX lipid and hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E).We inserted PpIX lipid into HVJ-E by centrifugation, and used the resultant porphyrus envelope in PDT of two drug-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and PC-3-DR.Porphyrus envelope enhanced uptake of PpIX, and cytotoxicity of PDT, relative to free PpIX lipid or PpIX induced by 5-ALA.PDT using porphyrus envelope has potential as a method for treating drug-resistant prostate cancer.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629697","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.768143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.715037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.549832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.434593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.431881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Photosensitizer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitizer"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Photochemistry","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry"},{"name":"Centrifugation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Talent agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent"},{"name":"Resultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant"},{"name":"Alpha-Linolenic acid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid"},{"name":"Viral envelope","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope"},{"name":"3D Realms","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Realms"}]}
