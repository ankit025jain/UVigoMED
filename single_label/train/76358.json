{"id":76358,"title":"[The association of leptin with dislipidemia in group of ethnic Kirghiz].","abstract":"The article deals with results of evaluation of relationship between leptin and lipid indicators in group of ethnic Kirghiz. The sampling included 322 ethnic Kirghiz (145 males and 177 females) aged from 30 to 75 years. To all patients was applied general clinical examination, anthropometric examination (height, body mass, waist circumference, thighs circumference). The body mass index was calculated. The level of glucose (on an empty stomach), lipids spectrum and leptin of blood serum were measured. The average age of patients consisted 57.7 +/- 9.6 years and average level of leptin was 7.8 ng/ml. The patients were allocated to three groups depending of tertile of leptin (< 3; 3.0-5.51; > or = 5.52 ng/ml in males; 9.6; 9.6-16.6; > or = 16.7 ng/ml in females). In patients from upper tertile as compared with patients from lower tertiles are noted high values of triglycerides (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p < 0.O01), in males and triglycerides (p = 0.02) in females. Leptin correlated with body mass index (in males: r = 0.68, p < 0.01; in females: r = 0.74, p < 0.001), concentration of triglycerides (in males: r = 0.301, p < 0.001; in females: r = 0.194, p < 0.001). Leptin correlated with total cholesterol in males (r = 0.214, p < 0.05) and with cholesterol of lipoproteins of high density in females (r = 0.156, p < 0.05). The level of leptin in group of ethnic Kirghiz is associated with dislipidemia, obesity, including abdominal obesity.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069216","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.864161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.652215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.533361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.358297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.356599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.153446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Belgian general election, 2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_general_election,_2010"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"},{"name":"Kyrgyz people","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_people"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
