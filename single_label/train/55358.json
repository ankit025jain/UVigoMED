{"id":55358,"title":"Estimating minimally important differences for two vision-specific quality of life measures.","abstract":"To estimate minimally important differences (MIDs) for the Visual Activities Questionnaire (VAQ) and the National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ).A total of 607 subjects with newly-diagnosed open-angle glaucoma (OAG) was enrolled in the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) and randomized to initial treatment with medications or surgery. Subjects underwent an ophthalmic examination and telephone-administered quality of life (QOL) interview before randomization and every six months thereafter. The VAQ and NEI-VFQ were used to assess participants' perceptions of their visual function. Clinical measures included the mean deviation (MD) from Humphrey 24-2 full threshold visual field (VF) testing, and best-corrected visual acuity (VA) measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Anchor-based (using MD and VA) and distribution-based methods were used to estimate MIDs.Anchor-based cross-sectional analyses at 66 months follow-up found a 10-letter increment in better eye VA corresponded to MIDs of 5.2 units for VAQ and 3.8 units for NEI-VFQ total scores. A 3-dB increment in the better eye MD yielded MIDs of 2.6 and 2.3 units for the same two questionnaires. In longitudinal analyses, MIDs for the VAQ were 3.2 units for a 10-letter change of VA and 3.4 units for a 3-dB change in the MD. Distribution-based MIDs were larger.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906863","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.839625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.732348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.666593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.619222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.577249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.215904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.215692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.110913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Absolute deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation"},{"name":"Mentioned in Despatches","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentioned_in_Despatches"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"OAG (band)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAG_(band)"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_3"}]}
