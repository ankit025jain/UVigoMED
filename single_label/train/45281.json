{"id":45281,"title":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of in-stent restenosis after bare metal stenting in native coronary arteries.","abstract":"In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains the most common complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. Due to shared risk factors, it is postulated that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients have an increased risk of ISR. This study aimed to determine the association between NAFLD and ISR in patients after bare metal stenting. This study included a cohort of 210 consecutive patients (150 men and 60 women) undergoing follow-up angiography. The primary end-point was angiographic ISR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for ISR. The cumulative ISR rate during follow-up was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Subgroup analyses were also done for different gender. The ISR rate was 29.5%. Patients with NAFLD had a significantly higher prevalence of ISR than patients without NAFLD (43.3 vs. 16.0%, P < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was associated with increased ISR, independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index (adjusted odds ratio: 2.688, 95% confidence intervals: 1.285-5.537, P < 0.001). Male NAFLD patients had a higher prevalence of ISR than patients without NAFLD (48.4 vs. 15.3%, P < 0.001), while the prevalence of ISR in female patients with and without NAFLD were comparable (7.7 vs. 17.0%, P = 0.404). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association between NAFLD and ISR in all patients (log-rank P = 0.008) and in male subgroup (log-rank P = 0.033), but not in female subgroup (log-rank P = 0.313). This preliminary study suggests that NAFLD could independently associate with a high prevalence of ISR, especially in male patients.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691745","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.796627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.741734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.693752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.545087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.533267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.31029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.307319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"End point of clinical trials","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_point_of_clinical_trials"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
