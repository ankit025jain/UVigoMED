{"id":45658,"title":"Clinical utility of plasma glypican-3 and osteopontin as biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"?-Fetoprotein (AFP) is the biomarker most widely used to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), despite its suboptimal diagnostic accuracy. Glypican-3 (GPC3) and osteopontin (OPN) are secreted glycoproteins that are reportedly associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical utility of using plasma GPC3 and OPN as diagnostic biomarkers for HCC.We measured the plasma levels of GPC3 and OPN in 120 HCC and 40 chronic liver disease (CLD) patients via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic accuracy of each tumor marker was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The GPC3 levels in the HCC patients (75.8 ng/mL) were significantly higher (p=0.020) than the levels in patients with CLD (66.4 ng/mL). The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) values for GPC3 and OPN were 0.62 and 0.51, respectively. In subgroup analyses, including subgroups of HCC patients with low serum AFP and PIVKA II levels, the AUROC of GPC3 remained relatively high (0.66), and GPC3 showed a high sensitivity (62.1%) for detecting small HCC tumors.The plasma levels of GPC3 and OPN demonstrated low diagnostic accuracy for HCC. However, GPC3 may have a complementary role in diagnosing HCC in patients with nondiagnostic levels of conventional tumor markers and with small-sized tumors.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672660","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.844756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.666485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.649827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.405046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Osteopontin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopontin"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.111667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Glypican","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glypican"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Clinical utility of diagnostic tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_utility_of_diagnostic_tests"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"X86 instruction listings","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Complementarity (molecular biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)"}]}
