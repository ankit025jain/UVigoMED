{"id":86375,"title":"Alveolar epithelium: beyond the barrier.","abstract":"I am deeply honored to have been awarded an American Thoracic Society Recognition Award for Scientific Accomplishment for 2014. Over the last 20 years, it has become clear that the alveolar epithelium, my area of research focus, is not simply a gas exchange surface and barrier to leakage of fluid and protein into the alveoli, but is an active participant in the pathogenesis of a number of lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Recognition by this Award stimulates a review of the awardee's contributions to the field, as summarized in this perspective.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783957","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Gas exchange","weight":0.620087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.47494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.40336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.378002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.267678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.212973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"American Thoracic Society","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Thoracic_Society"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"}]}
