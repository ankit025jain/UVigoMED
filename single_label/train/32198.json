{"id":32198,"title":"The use of \"aortic plication\" for coronary malperfusions in the arterial switch operation.","abstract":"During an arterial switch operation, reimplantation of the transferred coronary artery is required for malperfusion. However, this reimplantation increases the mortality risk. We describe here a simple technique in patients with malperfusion of the coronary arteries during the arterial switch operation. The surgical technique consists of an aortic plication on the opposite side of the kinking coronary artery.
