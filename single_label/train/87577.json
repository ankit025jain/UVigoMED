{"id":87577,"title":"Radiation exposure from head computed tomography scans in pediatric trauma.","abstract":"We have previously reported that children receive significantly less radiation exposure after abdominal and/or pelvis computed tomography (CT) scanning for acute appendicitis when performed at our children's hospital (CH) rather than at outside hospitals (OH). In this study, we compare the amount of radiation children receive from head CTs for trauma done at OH versus those at our CH.A retrospective chart review was performed on all children transferred to our hospital after receiving a head CT for trauma at an OH between July 2012 and December 2012. These children were then blindly case matched based on date, age, and gender to children at our CH.There were 50 children who underwent head CT scans for trauma at 28 OH. There were 21 females and 29 males in each group. Average age was 7.01 ± 0.5 y at the OH and 7.14 ± 6.07 at our CH (P = 0.92). Average weight was 30.81 ± 4.69 kg at the OH and 32.69 ± 27.21 kg at our CH (P = 0.81). Radiation measures included dose length product (671.21 ± 22.6 mGycm at OH versus 786.28 ± 246.3 mGycm at CH, P = 0.11) and CT dose index (53.4 ± 2.26 mGy at OH versus 49.2 ± 12.94 mGy at CH, P = 0.56).There is no significant difference between radiation exposure secondary to head CTs for traumatic injuries performed at OH and those at a dedicated CH.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25082747","annotations":[{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.874731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.767869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.444282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.423441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.367656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Ohio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"},{"name":"814","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/814"},{"name":"786","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/786"},{"name":"Order of the Companions of Honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"2120s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2120s"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mexican general election, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_general_election,_2012"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"}]}
