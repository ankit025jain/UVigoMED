{"id":67424,"title":"Prevalence of depression and associated factors among elderly sudanese: a household survey in Khartoum State.","abstract":"We assessed depression among 300 elderly Sudanese (age 60+ years). We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in 3 localities in Khartoum State. A 2-stage stratified sampling was carried out to select the localities and then the areas using simple random sampling; then systematic random sampling was used to select households. The prevalence of depression was 47.5%. Depression was significantly associated with age (P = 0.002), level of education (P = 0.015), occupation (P < 0.001), the problems of everyday living (P = 0.026), and social problems (P < 0.001). After controlling for confounders using multiple logistic regression, we found that depression was 4 times greater among the elderly retired compared to the elderly working, 3 times greater among the elderly with social problems and those who were suffering from urine incontinence and 2 times greater among the elderly with living problems.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617121","annotations":[{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.477349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"Khartoum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum"},{"name":"Stratified sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Khartoum (state)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum_(state)"},{"name":"Simple random sample","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Sudan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"Social issues","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issues"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
