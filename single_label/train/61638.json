{"id":61638,"title":"Multidrug resistance reversing activity of newly developed phenothiazines on P-glycoprotein (ABCB1)-related resistance of mouse T-lymphoma cells.","abstract":"Phenothiazines have anticancer properties and are able to reverse the multidrug resistance of neoplastic cells by inhibiting the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1 protein (ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein) activity.A series of new phenothiazine derivatives was investigated regarding their ABCB1-modulating effect on multidrug resistant mouse T-lymphoma cells by rhodamine 123 accumulation assay and real-time ethidium bromide accumulation assay.The phenothiazine derivatives exhibited a potent anticancer effect on the parental cell line and on its multidrug-resistant mouse T-lymphoma subline overexpressing the ABCB1 transporter. The inhibition of the ABCB1 transporter in the presence of the newly-developed phenothiazines was greater than that for the known ABCB1 inhibitors thioridazine and verapamil.Based on the chemical structures and biological activity, compounds with bivalent sulfur atom in the phenothiazine ring demonstrated marked ABCB1-modulating effect, however, other derivatives with halogen or amide substitutions were ineffective.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692704","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Sulfur","weight":0.799517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.789007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Amide","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.619484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Halogen","weight":0.59745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.526826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.506127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.475373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"Ethidium bromide","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethidium_bromide"},{"name":"Phenothiazine","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenothiazine"},{"name":"Rhodamine","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodamine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.319118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.296188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.138079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Divalent","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divalent"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.055812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"},{"name":"Thioridazine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioridazine"},{"name":"Verapamil","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verapamil"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"}]}
