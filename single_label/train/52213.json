{"id":52213,"title":"High prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Xavante Indians from Mato Grosso, Brazil.","abstract":"To estimate the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and describe demographic, anthropometric and medical characteristics, in a genetically distinct population: the Brazilian Xavante Indians.Population-based survey carried out among 948 Xavante from Mato Grosso, Brazil. Fasting and 2-hour after 75 g glucose capillary glycemia were measured by a portable glucometer (HemoCue Glucose201+). Diabetes was defined according to WHO criteria. Anthropometric data and medical characteristics were measured, and fat mass (%) was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance. Blood pressure was measured by an automated device (OMRON 742INTC), and hypertension was defined according to WHO criteria.Age-adjusted prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals were diabetes: 28.2% (25.3-31.1) in general, 18.4% (14.9-22.2) in men and 40.6% (36.2-45.1) in women (P<.001); impaired glucose tolerance: 32.3% (20.5-26.0) in general, 29.7% (25.4-33.9) in men and 34.4% (30.2-38.8) in women (P>.05); hypertension: 17.5% (15.1-19.9) in general. Obesity was found in 50.8% of the individuals. Fat mass (%) was associated with diabetes in men (P<.05) and women (P<.05). Thigh circumference and waist/ thigh ratio were lower in those with diabetes, in men and women (P<.001).The high prevalence of diabetes and obesity in Xavante is likely related to their recent change in food habits and physical activities. Our results should raise awareness about the magnitude of this health problem and also indicate that it could increase dramatically in the future if no preventive actions are adopted.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620446","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose
