{"id":82292,"title":"8-hydroxycudraxanthone G suppresses IL-8 production in SP-C1 tongue cancer cells.","abstract":"Production of IL-8 primarily promotes angiogenic responses in cancer cells, which lead to favorable disease progression. Suppressing this production may, therefore, be a significant therapeutic intervention in targeting tumor angiogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the reduction effects of xanthones in cancer cell lines. Nine known prenylated xanthones (1-9), isolated from the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana Linn (GML), were tested for their ability to suppress IL-8 (interleukin-8) of the SP-C1 (Supri's Clone 1) tongue cancer cell line. Of these compounds, 8-hydroxycudraxanthone-G (4) suppressed IL-8 within 48 hours. This is the first report of 8-hydroxycudraxanthone G suppressing the production of IL-8 (45% at 15.7 microg/mL in 48 hours). These results suggest that the prolonged suppression of IL-8 production by cancer cell lines is concerned in the anti-cancer activity of 8-hydroxycudraxanthone.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660467","annotations":[{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.590704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.540157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.417127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.302581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Purple mangosteen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_mangosteen"},{"name":"Prenylation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation"},{"name":"Fruit anatomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Garcinia","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcinia"},{"name":"Xanthonoid","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthonoid"}]}
