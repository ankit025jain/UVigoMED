{"id":65930,"title":"Up-regulating of RASD1 and apoptosis of DU-145 human prostate cancer cells induced by formononetin in vitro.","abstract":"Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant cancers in men. The isoflavone formononetin is a main active component of red clover plants. In the present study, we assessed the effect of formononetin on human prostate cancer DU-145 cells in vitro, and elucidated possible mechanisms. DU-145 cells were treated with different concentrations of formononetin and cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay, cell apoptosis by Hoechst 33258 and flow cytometry, and protein levels of RASD1, Bcl-2 and Bax by Western blotting. The results showed that formononetin inhibited the proliferation of DU-145 cells in a dose-dependent manner. DU-145 cells treated with different concentrations of formononetin displayed obvious morphological changes of apoptosis under fluorescence microscopy. In addition, formononetin increased the proportion of early apoptotic DU-145 cells, down-regulated the protein levels of Bcl-2 and up-regulated those of RASD1 and Bax. The level of RASD1 reached its maximum at 48 h post-treatment, and rapidly decreased thereafter. Together, we present evidence that formononetin triggered cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by up-regulating RASD1.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761910","annotations":[{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Hoechst stain","weight":0.824018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoechst_stain"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.696621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Isoflavones","weight":0.639484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavones"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.583644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.463177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.398019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.148263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Trifolium pratense","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifolium_pratense"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Wine color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_color"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
