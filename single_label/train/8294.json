{"id":8294,"title":"Lycopene inhibits neointimal hyperplasia through regulating lipid metabolism and suppressing oxidative stress.","abstract":"The present study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism(s) through which lycopene inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in restenosis models. A total of 32 white rabbits were randomly divided into the following four groups: A sham group, a model group, a model group treated with apocynin and a model group treated with lycopene. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to detect the carotid structures in these groups. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis were performed to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of the proteins involved in cell proliferation and oxidative stress, including anti?proliferating cell nuclear antigen, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1, hydroxymethyl glutaric acyl coenzyme A reductase, adenosine triphosphate?binding cassette transporter A1 and human neutrophil cytochrome b light chain. Immunohistochemistry and TEM indicated that lycopene treatment significantly reduced the intima/media ratios, the accumulation of lipids and the formation of foam cells in carotid plaques in rabbit restenosis models. Furthermore, lycopene regulated the blood lipid levels and suppressed the oxidative stress in these models. In addition, qPCR and western blot analyses revealed that lycopene significantly decreased the expression levels of cell proliferation?associated proteins, as well as proteins involved in lipid synthesis and transportation. The results suggest that lycopene may regulate lipid metabolism and suppress oxidative stress, and thus, represents a promising therapeutic against neointimal hyperplasia.
