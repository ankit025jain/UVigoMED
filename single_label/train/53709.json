{"id":53709,"title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of patients with benign formations of the adrenal cortex].","abstract":"In 2003 - 2013 yrs 48 patients were treated in the clinic for benign tumors of the adrenal cortex substance (ACS). Adrenal adenoma was diagnosed in 34 (70.8%) patients, nodular hyperplasia--in 14 (29.2%). In assumption about presence of primary hyperaldosteronism the blood from the adrenal veins ostium were taken selectively. Operative interventions were performed in 43 (89.6%) patients: laparoscopic adrenalectomy--in 18 (41.9%), adrenalectomy using open access--in 21 (48.8%), for nodular hyperplasia of ACS roentgenoendovascular adrenal destruction was performed in 4 (9.3%). Differentiated approach to choice of the treatment method was applied in the patients.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501992","annotations":[{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.487573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Adrenal adenoma","weight":0.466729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_adenoma"},{"name":"Adrenalectomy","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenalectomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.368031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hyperaldosteronism","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaldosteronism"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"American Cancer Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Differentiated instruction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction"}]}
