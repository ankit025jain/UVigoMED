{"id":87357,"title":"Fractures of the distal radius: postmanagement radiographic characterization.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to describe the management options available for the treatment of the distal radius fracture as well as potential associated complications.There are a wide variety of currently accepted and used treatment options for fractures of the distal radius, ranging from closed reduction with casting to various forms of invasive surgical management. The radiologist must be familiar with these various forms of management to recognize complications when present on follow-up radiographs.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247951","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.689713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.382439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.140536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.102959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
