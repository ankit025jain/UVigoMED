{"id":18003,"title":"Antifungal bromophenols from marine red alga Symphyocladia latiuscula.","abstract":"Three new highly brominated polyphenols, 1-3, together with one known bromophenol, 4, were isolated from the EtOH extract of a marine red alga Symphyocladia latiuscula collected from the coast of Qingdao, P. R. China. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic experiments (NMR and MS) and comparison with literature data. Compounds 3 and 4 showed activities against the Candida albicans with the MIC values of 25 and 12.5 ?g/ml, respectively.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827691","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Algae","weight":0.723523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae"},{"name":"Bromine","weight":0.557281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.456024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.40336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Red algae","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.315096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"People's Republic of China","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Organobromine compound","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organobromine_compound"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Qingdao","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Polyphenol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol"},{"name":"Malaysian Indian Congress","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Indian_Congress"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
