{"id":67918,"title":"The impact of metabolic syndrome on serum total testosterone level in patients with erectile dysfunction.","abstract":"To determine the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and serum testosterone levels (TT) in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).This study included 280 ED patients above 40-years-of-age. Participants were divided into two groups according to 2005 criteria of International Diabetes Federation. The severity of ED was determined according to the International Index of Erectile Function-EF (IIEF-EF score; 0-10 severe ED, 11-25 mild to moderate ED). The severity of ED, serum TT levels and other MetS components were compared between the groups.The mean age of the patients was 55.7?Â±?8.2 years. One hundred eighteen patients (%42.1) had MetS. Sixty-eight patients with MetS (57.6%) and 71 patients without MetS (43.8%) had severe ED (p?=?0.031). A total of 46 (16.4%) patients had hypogonadism. Hypogonadism was seen more prevalent in patients with MetS (22.9% vs. 11.7%, p?=?0.013). Logistic regression analyses for ED risk factors demonstrated that abnormal FBG increased the relative risk of severe ED up to 10.7-fold (p?<?0.001) but not presence of hypogonadism (p?=?0.706).Metabolic syndrome was seen in almost half of the patients with ED. ED was more severe among MetS patients. Hypogonadism alone is a not risk factor for severe ED.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576299","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.779189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.713725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.529709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.515713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.404832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"International Diabetes Federation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Diabetes_Federation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"706","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/706"},{"name":"1125","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1125"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
