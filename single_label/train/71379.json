{"id":71379,"title":"Treatment sequence of aromatase inhibitors and radiotherapy and long-term outcomes of breast cancer patients.","abstract":"The optimal sequence of radiotherapy (RT) and hormone therapy using aromatase inhibitors (AI) in patients with breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery is unclear. Several short-term analyses have shown that there are no differences in breast cancer outcomes according to the treatment sequence. However, long-term outcomes have not been reported.We retrospectively analyzed disease-free survival events in 315 consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery, RT, and received adjuvant AI at our Institute between 2001 and 2009. We compared the outcomes between treatment sequences of AI and RT (concurrent vs. sequential).With a median follow-up of 5.6 years, no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of disease-free survival (unadjusted p=0.6; adjusted p=0.5) were observed.Similarly to previous short-term reports, AI administration after RT and AI concurrently with RT are both reasonable treatment options for early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075064","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.595399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.282608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.223008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
