{"id":38218,"title":"Identification and functional analysis of a novel mutation in the SOX10 gene associated with Waardenburg syndrome type IV.","abstract":"Waardenburg syndrome type IV (WS4) is a rare genetic disorder, characterized by auditory-pigmentary abnormalities and Hirschsprung disease. Mutations of the EDNRB gene, EDN3 gene, or SOX10 gene are responsible for WS4. In the present study, we reported a case of a Chinese patient with clinical features of WS4. In addition, the three genes mentioned above were sequenced in order to identify whether mutations are responsible for the case. We revealed a novel nonsense mutation, c.1063C>T (p.Q355*), in the last coding exon of SOX10. The same mutation was not found in three unaffected family members or 100 unrelated controls. Then, the function and mechanism of the mutation were investigated in vitro. We found both wild-type (WT) and mutant SOX10 p.Q355* were detected at the expected size and their expression levels are equivalent. The mutant protein also localized in the nucleus and retained the DNA-binding activity as WT counterpart; however, it lost its transactivation capability on the MITF promoter and acted as a dominant-negative repressor impairing function of the WT SOX10.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440785","annotations":[{"name":"Hirschsprung's disease","weight":0.946214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.899068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor","weight":0.790266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphthalmia-associated_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.748303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Waardenburg syndrome","weight":0.694396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waardenburg_syndrome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.67311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.513395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.479929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Endothelin receptor type B","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin_receptor_type_B"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.279368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"SOX genes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX_genes"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
