{"id":2073,"title":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis: support for an early interval surgery.","abstract":"Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is advocated for acute cholecystitis, debate still exists about its optimal timing. This retrospective study compares the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy within versus later than 5 days of onset of symptoms in patients with acute cholecystitis.One hundred thirty six patients with acute cholecystitis grade I or II were included in the study and divided in two groups. Group 1 received surgery within 5 days of symptoms and group 2 received conservative therapy and delayed surgery after 6 weeks.Group 1 and 2 consisted of 100 and 36 patients respec- tively. Because of failure of conservative therapy 5 patients of group 2 had surgery before 6 weeks. The remaining 31 patients underwent surgery after 6 weeks. Preoperative ERCP was indicated in 2 and 11 patients in groups 1 and 2 respectively (p < 0.001). The median total hospital stay was 3.0 days for group 1 and 11.0 days for group 2 (p < 0.001). In terms of operation time, conversion rates, intraoperative cholangiography, postoperative ERCP, morbidity or mortality both groups were comparable (p > 0.05).Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely within 5 days after the onset of symptoms in patients with acute cholecystitis. Because of shortened total hospital stay and risk of failure of conservative therapy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be favored.","date":"2014-12-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509201","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.720203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.329985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.150301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Conversion rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Cholangiography","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiography"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
