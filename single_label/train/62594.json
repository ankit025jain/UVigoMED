{"id":62594,"title":"Role of high expression of IL-9 in prognosis of CLL.","abstract":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common leukemia in adults, but its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is initially described as a growth factor secreted by helper T cells. Recently, the oncogenic activities of IL-9 were reported in some leukemia but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The purpose of the present study is to investigate the expression of IL-9 from patients with CLL and to evaluate its correlation with clinical characteristics. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with CLL were analyzed using ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blot. ELISA analysis indicated IL-9 could be detected in 20 of 47 sera from CLL patients while none serum sample from healthy volunteers contained detectable levels of IL-9. There was a higher expression of IL-9 within PBMCs from patients with CLL compared with B cells of healthy blood donors using RT-PCR and western blot. The upregulated IL-9 was correlated to the clinical staging, ZAP-70 expression, ?2 microglobulin expression and IgVH status of CLL patients (P<0.05). Our findings suggest that overexpression of IL-9 may contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL and is associated with some adverse prognostic parameters.
