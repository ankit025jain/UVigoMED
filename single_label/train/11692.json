{"id":11692,"title":"Therapeutic application of adipose derived stem cells in acute myocardial infarction: lessons from animal models.","abstract":"The majority of patients survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Their outcome is negatively influenced by post-AMI events, such as loss of viable cardiomyocytes due to a post-AMI inflammatory response, eventually resulting in heart failure and/or death. Recent pre-clinical animal studies indicate that mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (ASC) are new promising candidates that may facilitate cardiovascular regeneration in the infarcted myocardium. In this review we have compared all animal studies in which ASC were used as a therapy post-AMI and have focused on aspects that might be important for future successful clinical application of ASC.
