{"id":80361,"title":"Clinico-epidemiological study of Schistosomiasis mansoni in Waja-Timuga, District of Alamata, northern Ethiopia.","abstract":"Intestinal schistosomiasis, caused by digenetic trematodes of the genus Schistosoma, is the most prevalent water related disease that causes considerable morbidity and mortality. Although prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection has been reported for the present study area, earlier studies have not estimated intensity of infections in relation to periportal fibrosis, which would have been crucial for epidemiological and clinical evaluations. Hence, a community based cross sectional study was conducted from December 2011 to March 2012 to assess prevalence of infection and schistosomal periportal fibrosis in Waja-Timuga, northern Ethiopia.In a cross sectional study involving 371 randomly selected individuals, fresh stool samples were collected and processed by the Kato-Katz method and examined microscopically. Ultrasonography was used to determine status of schistosomal periportal fibrosis and to detect hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly. Serum was collected for assay of hepatic activity. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 11 statistical soft ware. P-value <0.05 was reported as statistically significant.The prevalence of S.mansoni infection was 73.9%, while the prevalence of schistosomal periportal fibrosis was 12.3% and mean intensity of infection was 234 eggs per gram of stool. Peak prevalence and intensity of S.mansoni infection was documented in the age range of 10-20Â years. Among the study individuals, hepatomegaly was recorded in 3.7% and splenomegaly was recorded in 7.4% of the study individuals. Similarly, among the study individuals who had definite periportal fibrosis, 5.9% had elevated liver enzyme levels.The high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection and schistosomal periportal fibrosis observed in the study area calls for a periodic deworming program to reduce disease, morbidity and transmission. Preventive chemotherapy complemented with other control measures is highly required for sustainable control of schistosomiasis in the study area.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690404","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Hepatomegaly","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatomegaly"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Digenea","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digenea"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.758635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.758399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.707151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Trematoda","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.516328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.508649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.377274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.147223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.144639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Deworming","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworming"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cross section (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
