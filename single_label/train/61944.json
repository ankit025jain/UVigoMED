{"id":61944,"title":"Methemoglobinemia with the use of benzocaine spray for awake fiberoptic intubation.","abstract":"We report a case in which the use of benzocaine spray to facilitate awake fiber optic intubation (FOI) in a patient with a difficult airway caused methemoglobinemia intraoperatively. Local benzocaine was sprayed to numb the patient's airway for a total time of one second, fifteen minutes later SpO2 decreased to 85% on the pulse oximeter. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a MetHb of 24.6% of total Hemoglobin. The patient was successfully treated with methylene blue intravenously and recovered uneventfully. Small amounts of local benzocaine sprayed to numb the airway can cause significant methemoglobinemia that requires immediate recognition and appropriate management.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649793","annotations":[{"name":"Pulse oximeter","weight":0.896156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximeter"},{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.630477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.602278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Methemoglobinemia","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Benzocaine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzocaine"},{"name":"Methylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Alticor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alticor"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Arterial blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"}]}
