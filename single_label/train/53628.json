{"id":53628,"title":"Text message program improves outcomes, decreases ED utilization among ED patients with poorly controlled diabetes.","abstract":"Diabetic patients who lack access to primary care tend to frequent the ED, often with complications from their disease that could have been prevented with proper management and education. To get around the problem of access, researchers tested an automated program that continuously delivered educational messaging via text to a group of patients who presented to the ED with poorly controlled diabetes. After six months, researchers noted improvements in Hb A1c levels, self-reported medication adherence, and ED utilization when compared with a control group. And the impact was particularly noteworthy among Latinos, according to the researchers. The text messaging program, dubbed TExT-Med, was developed by four physicians and two diabetes educators. The messages were delivered daily, and contained educational as well motivational content derived from the National Diabetes Education Program.There were also medication reminders, healthy living challenges, and trivia questions about diabetes. At six months, Hb A1c levels decreased by 1.05% in the intervention group, compared to 0.60% in the control group, and self-reported medication adherence improved from 4.5 to 5.4 (as measured on an 8 point scale) in the intervention group versus a decrease of 0.1 in the control group. During the six-month study period, 35.9% of patients in the intervention group presented to the ED for care, as compared to 51.6% of patients in the control group.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505864","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.69917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Text messaging","weight":0.373306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0436208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hispanic and Latino Americans","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Dubbing (filmmaking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Trivia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivia"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Message","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message"}]}
