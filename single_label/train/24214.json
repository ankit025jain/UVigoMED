{"id":24214,"title":"Melioidosis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei in drinking water, Thailand, 2012.","abstract":"We identified 10 patients in Thailand with culture-confirmed melioidosis who had Burkholderia pseudomallei isolated from their drinking water. The multilocus sequence type of B. pseudomallei from clinical specimens and water samples were identical for 2 patients. This finding suggests that drinking water is a preventable source of B. pseudomallei infection.
