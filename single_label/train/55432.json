{"id":55432,"title":"Apolipoprotein E gene ?4?4 is associated with elevated risk of primary open angle glaucoma in Asians: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene ?2/?3/?4 polymorphism and glaucoma susceptibility. However, the published data are still inconclusive. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of APOE gene ?2/?3/?4 polymorphism on glaucoma risk by using meta-analysis.A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Elsevier Science Direct and CNKI databases was conducted to identify relevant articles, with the last report up to January 5, 2014. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of association by using the fixed or random effect model.Fifteen separate studies including 2,700 cases and 2,365 controls were included in the meta-analysis. We did not detect a significant association between APOE gene ?2/?3/?4 polymorphism and glaucoma in overall population (P?>?0.0083). In Asians, we detected an association of the ?4?4 genotype with elevated risk for glaucoma (OR?=?5.22, 95% CI?=?1.85-14.68, P?=?0.002), mainly for primary open angle glaucoma (OR?=?4.98, 95% CI?=?1.75-14.20, P?=?0.003).The meta-analysis suggests that APOE gene ?4?4 may be associated with elevated risk for primary open angle glaucoma in Asians. However, more epidemiologic studies based on larger sample size, case-control design and stratified by ethnicity as well as types of glaucoma are suggested to further clarify the relationship between APOE gene ?2/?3/?4 polymorphism and genetic predisposition to glaucoma.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye
