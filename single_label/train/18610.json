{"id":18610,"title":"[Defensins level in patients with inflammatory diseases of maxillofacial area].","abstract":"Molecular study of congenital immune factors was conducted in 45 patients with inflammatory diseases of maxillofacial area. The study focused on expression of cationic low-molecular peptides ?- and ?-defensines in oral mucosa. These peptides are involved in antibacterial activity and regulation of immune reactions. The results showed 20-fold increase in defensines expression in oral mucosa of patients with inflammatory diseases of maxillofacial area when compared to control group (12 healthy individuals) thus proving an important role they play in the development of the disease. Therapy with cytokines may be indicated in these cases.
