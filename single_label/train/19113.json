{"id":19113,"title":"Clinical features and evolution of organ dysfunctions in sepsis.","abstract":"In sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response is adapted to the etiologic agent and the increase in the level of mediators is associated with organ dysfunction. Currently, a rapid assessment of patient ability to develop an adequate immune response is not possible, the response mechanisms being similar in the context of different etiological agents.To find statistical arguments for the evolution of laboratory parameters in sepsis patients.This retrospective study included 90 patients diagnosed with sepsis. The clinical, etiological, and laboratory data, and Carmeli and APACHE II prognostic scores were analyzed. The data were processed using SPSS version 16.0.The causative agents was identified in 16 cases; organ involvement and systemic response varied, and no statistical correlations were found between the inflammatory syndrome parameters and Carmeli or APACHE II prognostic scores or identification of the causative agent.Statistical correlations were found between maximum blood glucose levels and the presence of organ dysfunction in the studied sepsis patients. No correlations were found between sepsis severity and the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia, or between fever syndrome and inflammatory syndrome.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741778","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.603657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.524967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.411335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.328977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.328812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"APACHE II","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APACHE_II"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.100046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
