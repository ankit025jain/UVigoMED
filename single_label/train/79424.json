{"id":79424,"title":"[The difficulties encountered in diagnostics of malignant neoplasms of the middle ear in the children].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to estimate the potential of CT and MRI diagnostics of malignant neoplasms of the middle ear in the children. Diagnostics of these tumours encounters great difficulties. We analysed the main subjective and objective causes underlying these difficulties and accounting for the late detection of the pathology being considered. Special attention is given to the possibilities of using CT and MRI techniques for diagnostics of malignant neoplasms of the middle ear in the children. The differential radiodiagnostic criteria for malignant tumours are proposed.
