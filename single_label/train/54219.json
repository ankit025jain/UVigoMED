{"id":54219,"title":"Applications of Hadamard transform-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to the detection of acetone in healthy human and diabetes mellitus patient breath.","abstract":"The Hadamard transform-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HT-GC/MS) technique was successfully employed to detect acetone, a biomarker for diabetes mellitus (DM) prediction, in human breath. Samples of exhaled breath were collected from four DM patients (one type-I and three type-II) and eight volunteers (nondiabetic healthy subjects), respectively. The gas samples, without any pretreatment, were simultaneously injected into a GC column through a Hadamard-injector based on Hadamard codes. Under optimized conditions, when cyclic S-matrix orders of 255, 1023 and 2047 were used, the S/N ratios of the acetone signals were substantially improved by 8.0-, 16.0- and 22.6-fold, respectively; these improvements are in good agreement with theoretically calculated values. We found that the breath acetone concentration levels in the four DM patients and the eight volunteers ranged from 1 to 10 ppmv and 0.1 to 1 ppmv, respectively.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468386","annotations":[{"name":"Gas","weight":0.54065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.44614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.388223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.310088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.299321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.143079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1023","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1023"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"2047","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2047"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Jacques Hadamard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Deutsche Mark","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark"},{"name":"Supernova","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Indian independence movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
