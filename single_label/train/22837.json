{"id":22837,"title":"In vitro activity of fosfomycin in combination with linezolid against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","abstract":"The objective of this paper was to investigate the in vitro effects of fosfomycin combined with linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A total of 102 MRSA isolates isolated from clinical specimens of human infections from three hospitals in China were studied. The microdilution checkerboard method was used to determine whether combinations act synergistically against these isolates. The susceptibility results for fosfomycin and linezolid were interpreted according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Synergy and indifference were defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index of ?0.5 and >0.5 but ?4, respectively. The combination of fosfomycin and linezolid demonstrated the following interactions: 98.04% (100/102) synergism; 1.96% (2/102) indifference; no antagonism was seen. Thus, the combination between fosfomycin and linezolid shows synergism for most of the MRSA isolates tested in this study. If these findings are confirmed in further in vitro or in vivo studies, the above combination could be tested clinically for difficulty to treat MRSA infections, particularly those warranting prolonged oral therapy.
