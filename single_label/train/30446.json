{"id":30446,"title":"Anxiety and suicidal ideation predict successful completion of substance abuse treatment in a criminal justice sample.","abstract":"The goal of this study was to identify predictors of successful substance abuse treatment in an out-patient clinic for individuals being monitored under community corrections supervision. Of the 615 participants, 117 (19%) successfully completed treatment. The results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that successful treatment was associated with several baseline characteristics including: older age, White race, having greater than a high school education, lower level of care, meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder, reporting suicidal ideation, and not having a history of opioid use. The value of self-report of problems and its influence on treatment in the culture of the criminal justice population is discussed in this article.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499463","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.545807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.510273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.421849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.30626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Criminal justice","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.256173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.105721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.104145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"School","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0809679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Corrections","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Justice","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice"}]}
