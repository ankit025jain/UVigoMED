{"id":79940,"title":"Control of clonorchiasis in Korea: effectiveness of health education for community leaders and individuals in an endemic area.","abstract":"To develop effective intervention programmes to control Clonorchis sinensis infection, three interventions were evaluated in a clonorchiasis-endemic area of Korea.Four thousand two hundred and sixty-seven voluntary participants in Sancheong county were tested at baseline and two follow-up surveys after 1 and 3 years. Faecal samples were examined for C. sinensis eggs using the Kato-Katz method. Participants were divided into three intervention groups by areas and year recruited: national prevention programme only (mass health campaign and praziquantel treatment) for Group A; health education for community leaders added for Group B; and individual health education added for Group C.The prevalence of C. sinensis infection fell substantially in all three intervention groups between baseline and 3-year follow-up: from 31.1% to 14.9% in Group A, from 29.6% to 6.8% in Group B and from 21.9% to 8.6% in Group C. The control effectiveness was highest in Group B with 76.8%. The new infection rate was 16.3%, 12.8% and 7.6% in Group A, B and C, respectively. The reinfection rate was lower in Group B (3.8%) than Group C (12.2%).To control C. sinensis infection in endemic areas of Korea, health education for community leaders or individuals on prevention of C. sinensis infection should be added to national control programmes.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862476","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.474575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.438373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.238326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.196702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0635026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Nationalization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization"},{"name":"Clonorchis sinensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonorchis_sinensis"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Political campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign"},{"name":"Orange (fruit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Junkers Ju 86","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_86"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Sancheong","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancheong"}]}
