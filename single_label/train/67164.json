{"id":67164,"title":"Evaluation of the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans in patients with interstitial cystis.","abstract":"Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) pathogenesis is not fully known, but evidence shows that glycosaminoglycans (GAG) of bladder urothelium can participate in its genesis. The loss of these compounds facilitates the contact of urine compounds with deeper portions of bladder wall triggering an inflammatory process. We investigated GAG in urine and tissue of PBS/IC and pure stress urinary incontinence (SUI) patients to better understand its metabolism.Tissue and urine of 11 patients with PBS/IC according to NIDDK criteria were compared to 11 SUI patients. Tissue samples were analyzed by histological, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence methods. Statistical analysis were performed using t Student test and Anova, considering significant when p < 0.05.PBS/IC patients had lower concentration of GAG in urine when compared to SUI (respectively 0.45 ± 0.11 x 0.62 ± 0.13 mg/mg creatinine, p < 0.05). However, there was no reduction of the content of GAG in the urothelium of both groups. Immunofluorescence showed that PBS/IC patients had a stronger staining of TGF-beta, decorin (a proteoglycan of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate), fibronectin and hyaluronic acid.the results suggest that GAG may be related to the ongoing process of inflammation and remodeling of the dysfunctional urothelium that is present in the PBS/IC.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642152","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Proteoglycan","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteoglycan"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Glycosaminoglycan","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosaminoglycan"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.547143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.493682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.277717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Diabetes_and_Digestive_and_Kidney_Diseases"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.180332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.17051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
