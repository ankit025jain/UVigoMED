{"id":7677,"title":"Use of a novel morphometric method and body fat index system for estimation of body composition in overweight and obese dogs.","abstract":"To develop morphometric equations for prediction of body composition and create a body fat index (BFI) to estimate body fat percentage in overweight and obese dogs.Prospective evaluation study.83 overweight or obese dogs ? 1 year of age.Body condition score (BCS) was assessed on a 5-point scale, morphometric measurements were made, and visual and palpation-based assessments and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were performed. Equations for predicting lean body mass, fat mass, and body fat as a percentage of total body weight (ie, body fat percentage) on the basis of morphometric measurements were generated with best-fit statistical models. Visual and palpation-based descriptors were used to develop a BFI. Predicted values for body composition components were compared with DEXA-measured values.For the study population, the developed morphometric equations accounted for 98% of the variation in lean body mass and fat mass and 82% of the variation in body fat percentage. The proportion of dogs with predicted values within 10% of the DEXA values was 66 of 83 (80%) for lean body mass, 56 of 83 (68%) for fat mass, and 56 of 83 (67%) for body fat percentage. The BFI accurately predicted body fat percentage in 25 of 47 (53%) dogs, whereas the value predicted with BCS was accurate in 6 of 47 (13%) dogs.Morphometric measurements and the BFI appeared to be more accurate than the 5-point BCS method for estimation of body fat percentage in overweight and obese dogs. Further research is needed to assess the applicability of these findings to other populations of dogs.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846427","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.660805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.601848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.553926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.383257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.360594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Body fat percentage","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"British Film Institute","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Bowl Championship Series","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series"}]}
