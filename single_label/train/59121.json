{"id":59121,"title":"Qualitative cross-cultural exploration of vaginal bleeding/spotting symptoms and impacts associated with hormone therapy in post-menopausal women to inform the development of new patient-reported measurement tools.","abstract":"To understand the vaginal bleeding/spotting experiences of postmenopausal (PM) women taking estrogen plus progestin therapies (EPT) and develop measures to assess these symptoms and their impact on women's daily lives in four countries.(1) Concept elicitation interviews were conducted with PM women in the US (n=14), Italy (n=15), Mexico (n=15) and China (n=15) to explore vaginal bleeding/spotting symptoms associated with EPT. The Post-Menopausal Bleeding Questionnaire (PMBQ) was also debriefed to evaluate understanding and comprehensiveness. (2) Based on concept elicitation, a single item electronic daily diary was developed and the PMBQ modified to form a 12-item impact measure. (3) The measures were pilot-tested and then cognitively debriefed with US women receiving EPT. All qualitative data was subject to thematic analysis.The Vaginal Bleeding/Spotting Daily Diary, (VBS-DD) and Post-Menopausal Bleeding Impact Questionnaire (PMBIQ) were developed in this study.Concept elicitation identified vaginal bleeding and spotting as important symptoms for women taking EPT, impacting their emotional wellbeing, social life, ability to move freely, clothing and sexual activity. Based on pilot testing and cognitive debriefing, women demonstrated good understanding of the VBS-DD and the PMBQ was reduced to 10 items due to conceptual redundancy.Women taking EPT in the US, China, Mexico and Italy reported vaginal bleeding/spotting symptoms that have a detrimental impact on their quality of life. Two new measures were developed to assess the severity and impact of vaginal bleeding/spotting specific to EPT. This work highlights the need for EPT-related symptoms to be a part of treatment decision-making.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856282","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Progestin","weight":0.599617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestin"},{"name":"China","weight":0.572292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.529401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.490704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.339055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.307397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.251631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Vaginal bleeding","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_bleeding"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Prime minister","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Pregnancy test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_test"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Qualitative data","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
