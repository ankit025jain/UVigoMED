{"id":53217,"title":"Low serum level of secreted frizzled-related protein 5, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, is associated with coronary artery disease.","abstract":"Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) is an anti-inflammatory adipokine that is associated with insulin resistance in animals. To extend these observations to humans, we investigated the association of serum SFRP5 levels in subjects with and without coronary artery disease (CAD).Subjects (n=185, 68Â±11 years, 79% male) suspected of having CAD were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups, CAD and non-CAD subjects, according to the results of their coronary angiographies. Serum SFRP5 levels of the subjects were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The serum SFRP5 levels in the subjects with CAD were significantly lower than those in the non-CAD subjects (median [interquartile range]: 47.7 [26.6] vs. 52.4 [29.6] ng/mL, respectively; p=0.02). The serum SFRP5 levels significantly correlated with body mass index, the homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance, adiponectin levels, and CAD severity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a decreased serum SFRP5 level (log transformed) was independently associated with CAD for all subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.94; p=0.03).Serum SFRP5 levels are significantly associated with CAD in humans, suggesting that low SFRP5 levels may contribute to CAD.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530778","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.861562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.770807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.680252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.656832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.596015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.445754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.442226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.267804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.208811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
