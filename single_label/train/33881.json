{"id":33881,"title":"[Poland's syndrome and free autologous fat grafts].","abstract":"To evaluate the final reconstructive results in 6 cases of female Poland syndrome treated in a first stage with an anatomical high cohesive breast implants and in a second stage with free autologous fat grafts.Six females were submitted to bilateral breast reconstruction. The reconstruction was done using anatomical breast implants as first step and after 11 to 18 months the free autologous fat grafting using the Coleman technique as well as treating the contralateral breast to achieve a better symmetry and volume. Photographies taken pre and postoperatively and the Foucras Classification were used to determine volume. Four months after the last surgery the patients answered a satisfaction questionnaire.In all 6 patients there was an improvement of the thoracic contour a year after the last surgery in terms of volume, projection and width of the breast.The use of free autologous fat grafts improves the results in cases of Poland's syndrome previously treated with breast implants making possible to correct the anterior axillary fold, projection and symmetry with a versatile method, with a low morbidity rate, allowing for a personalized treatment.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783646","annotations":[{"name":"Poland syndrome","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_syndrome"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.63852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.63219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.577641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.338048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0968837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"Anterior axillary line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_axillary_line"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Four Months Later...","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Months_Later..."},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
