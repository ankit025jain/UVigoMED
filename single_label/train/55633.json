{"id":55633,"title":"Mild decentration measured by a Scheimpflug camera and its impact on visual quality following SMILE in the early learning curve.","abstract":"To measure decentration following femtosecond laser small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism in the early learning curve, and to investigate its impact on visual quality.A total of 55 consecutive patients (100 eyes) who underwent the SMILE procedure were included. Decentration was measured using a Scheimpflug camera 6 months after surgery. Uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (UDVA, CDVA), manifest refraction, and wavefront errors were also measured. Associations between decentration and the preoperative spherical equivalent were analyzed, as well as the associations between decentration and wavefront aberrations.Regarding efficacy and safety, 40 eyes (40%) had an unchanged CDVA; 32 eyes (32%) gained one line; and 11 eyes (11%) gained two lines. Fifteen eyes (15%) lost one line of CDVA, and two eyes (2%) lost two lines. Ninety-nine of the treated eyes (99%) had a postoperative UDVA better than 1.0, and 100 eyes (100%) had a UDVA better than 0.8. The mean decentered displacement was 0.17 Â± 0.09 mm. The decentered displacement of all treated eyes (100%) was within 0.50 mm; 70 eyes (70%) were within 0.20 mm; and 90 eyes (90%) were within 0.30 mm. The vertical coma showed the greatest increase in magnitude. The magnitude of horizontal decentration was found to be associated with an induced horizontal coma.This study suggests that, although mild decentration occurred in the early learning curve, good visual outcomes were achieved after the SMILE surgery. Special efforts to minimize induced vertical coma are necessary.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845636","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.841674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.801885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.74927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.640024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.254944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.138197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Ninetynine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninetynine"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mild ale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_ale"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Life and death","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_death"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"30 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Scheimpflug principle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheimpflug_principle"},{"name":"SMILE (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILE_(magazine)"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Subjective video quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_video_quality"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Learning curve","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve"}]}
