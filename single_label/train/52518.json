{"id":52518,"title":"Efficacy of low-dose rosuvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypo high-density lipoprotein cholesterolaemia.","abstract":"To analyse the efficacy of low-dose rosuvastatin for treating hypo high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.Patients with HDL-cholesterol (C) < 40 mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) < 400 mg/dl who were receiving treatment with lipid-lowering drugs other than rosuvastatin (or previously untreated with lipid-lowering drugs) and with low-density lipoprotein [LDL]-C ? 120 mg/dl were included. Patients were treated with 2.5 or 5 mg rosuvastatin orally, once daily, to achieve the target LDL-C level specified in Japanese guidelines. Changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C, TG, LDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and non-HDL-C at 3 and 6 months were prospectively analysed. Safety was evaluated by examining changes in hepatorenal function, glucose metabolism and creatine kinase.Out of 49 patients, all lipid parameters other than TG were significantly improved at 3 and 6 months. At 3 months, 83.3% of patients had achieved the target LDL-C level. Among nonlipid parameters, no changes were observed except for estimated glomerular filtration rate, which was improved by + 5.2% and + 9.6% at 3 and 6 months, respectively.Low-dose rosuvastatin was effective in improving hypo-HDL cholesterolaemia and may have renoprotective effects.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595147","annotations":[{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.798721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Rosuvastatin","weight":0.618284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosuvastatin"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.593279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.266957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.231061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"}]}
