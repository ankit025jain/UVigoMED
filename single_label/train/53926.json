{"id":53926,"title":"Comparison of outcomes after laparoscopic versus posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy: a pilot study.","abstract":"Posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) was popularized by Walz and colleagues as an alternative approach to minimally invasive adrenalectomy, offering less postoperative pain and faster return to normal activity compared with laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy (LA). The authors have recently changed from LA to PRA in suitable patients and audited their outcomes.Data were prospectively collected for 10 patients who underwent PRA, and a chart review and telephone interviews were conducted with 13 consecutive patients who underwent LA by the same surgeon. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, analgesia use, operative and anesthetic time, length of stay, and complications were recorded.Data were collected for 13 LAs and 10 PRAs. Patients' baseline characteristics, including age, BMI, and tumor size, were similar between the 2 groups. There were no conversions to open surgery, transfusions, or deaths. Operative time was similar between the 2 groups. PRA patients required less, inpatient postoperative opioid analgesia compared with LA patients (median 1.25 vs. 23 mg of intravenous morphine equivalent, P=0.003), and had a shorter length of stay (median 1 vs. 2 d, P<0.001). The median total days on opioids were lower for PRA patients compared with LA patients (0.5 vs. 9 d, P<0.001).Our initial results supports previously published findings that PRA is a safe procedure, with a relatively short learning curve, resulting in reduced postoperative analgesia use, and reduced length of hospital stay when compared with the laparoscopic transperitoneal approach.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487160","annotations":[{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.72001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.692417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.390405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.145327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Adrenalectomy","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenalectomy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Waltz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz"},{"name":"Local government","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
