{"id":65828,"title":"Angiotensin receptor blockers - advantages of the new sartans.","abstract":"Advantages of the new angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) include once daily dosing, an absence of significant adverse reactions, well tolerated side effect profile and cost effectiveness. A growing realization is their beneficial pleotropic effects. Antihypertensive agents are widely used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events partly beyond that of blood pressure-lowering. The RAAS, and its primary mediator Ang II, also have a direct influence on the progression of the atherosclerotic process via effects on endothelial function, inflammation, fibrinolytic balance, and plaque stability. For patients at high cardiovascular risk based on the results of the ONTARGET and TRANSCEND studies, telmisartan is indicated for cardiovascular prevention. Studies have shown that olmesartan medoxomil treatment may slow the progression of atherosclerosis and postpone albuminuria thereby potentially improving CV outcomes.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772750","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.814798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor antagonist","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Renin-angiotensin system","weight":0.729365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin-angiotensin_system"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.357753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.357706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Angiotensin receptor","weight":0.323844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_receptor"},{"name":"Telmisartan","weight":0.28493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmisartan"},{"name":"Olmesartan","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmesartan"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Blocking (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
