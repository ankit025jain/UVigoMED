{"id":46157,"title":"[The comparative study on the regulation of apoptosis by hepatitis B virus X protein between B and C genotype].","abstract":"To investigate the apoptosis regulation on hepatoma cells by HBx between genotype B and C.Genotype B and C HBx gene fragments were amplified and inserted into green fluorescent protein (GFP) eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1 to construct recombinant pGFP-XB and pGFP-XC. The pEGFP-C1, pGFP-XB and pGFP-XC were introduced into Bel-7402 cells by Fugene HD to obtain Bel-7402 cells expressing GFP. The transcription and expression of HBx gene were demonstrated by RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis. Bel-7402, Bel-7402/GFP, Bel-7402/GFP-XB, Bel-7402/GFP-XC cells were treated with adriamycin (2.5 microg/ml), and the apoptosis of the cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and flow cytometry analysis.RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis showed that HBx genes of genotypes B and C were transcribed and expressed in Bel-7402/GFP-XB, Bel-7402/GFP-XC cells. Trypan blue exclusion showed adriamycin induced time-dependent cell death in Bel-7402, Bel-7402/GFP cells while no significant cell death was observed in Bel-7402/GFP-XB, Bel-7402/GFP-XC cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that no significant differences of apoptosis rates of Bel-7402/GFP-XB (3.87%) and of Bel7402/GFP-XC (4.01%) were observed (P > 0.05), moreover, no significant differences of Bel-7402/ GFP-XB (3.87%), Be17402/GFP-XC (4.01%) and of the untreated cells. Apoptosis rates in Bel-7402/GFP-XB (3.87%), Bel-7402/GFP-XC (4.01%) cells were significantly lower than those in Bel-7402 (27.05%) and Bel-7402/GFP (29.14%) cells at 48 hours after the adriamycin treatment (P < 0.01).Bel-7402 cell lines expressing GFP, GFP-XB and GFP-XC fusion proteins were successfully established. HBV X protein blocks adriamycin-induced apoptosis of Bel-7402 cells. There is no difference between HBx of genotype B and C in inhibiting apoptosis induced by adriamycin.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645318","annotations":[{"name":"Green fluorescent protein","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Expression vector","weight":0.866808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_vector"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.865385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.768283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.684946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.682332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.625663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.418165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Trypan blue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypan_blue"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
