{"id":65052,"title":"[Transurethral enucleation plus pneumo-cystostomy rotary cut for large benign prostatic hyperplasia].","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility, effectiveness and practicability of transurethral enucleation plus pneumocystostomy rotary cut (TUE + PCRC) for large benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).We performed TUE + PCRC for 26 BPH patients aged 62 - 85 years with the prostate volume of 80 - 165 ml. We conducted transurethral enucleation of the hyperplastic prostate glands and pushed them into the bladder, followed by bladder puncture for pneumo-cystostomy rotary cut.All the surgical procedures were successfully accomplished, with the mean surgical time of 41 (32 - 54) minutes and intraoperative blood loss < 60 ml in all the cases. Twenty-three of the patients were followed up for 2 - 8 months, which revealed no stricture of the urethra or any other severe complications. Compared with the preoperative baseline, significant improvement was achieved in the IPSS (6.5 +/- 2.2 vs 26.2 +/- 2.4), QOL (1.4 +/- 0.9 vs 4.6 +/- 1.2) and Qmax ([5.8 +/- 1.0 ] vs [19.6 +/- 2.8] ml/s) of the patients after surgery (P < 0.01).TUE + PCRC, with its advantages of short operation time and less severe complications, is a safe and effective approach to the management of large BPH.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029859","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.556646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.533551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.414804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Panama Canal Railway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal_Railway"},{"name":"Masalit language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masalit_language"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
