{"id":45624,"title":"Aspiration therapy for acute superior mesenteric artery embolism with an angled guiding sheath and guiding catheter.","abstract":"Seven patients with superior mesenteric artery embolism were treated by aspiration with the use of a 6-F angled guiding sheath and a 6-F guiding catheter through an 8-F short sheath by direct advancement using a telescopic and \"biting-off\" technique. Aspiration of the trunk took between 30 and 60 minutes (median, 44.0 min), and total procedure time ranged from 34 to 94 minutes (median, 60 min). Five of six trunk lesions and six of nine branch lesions were successfully aspirated. One dissection was observed. Six patients underwent bowel resection. Two patients died and the remaining five survived for a median of 868.2 days without complications.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674219","annotations":[{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.717567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric artery","weight":0.555703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.484432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.376865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.350485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bowel resection","weight":0.304438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_resection"},{"name":"Aspiration pneumonia","weight":0.206299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.059578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"868","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"LMS Stanier Class 8F","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMS_Stanier_Class_8F"},{"name":"GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM-Ford_6-speed_automatic_transmission"}]}
