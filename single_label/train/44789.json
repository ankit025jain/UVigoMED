{"id":44789,"title":"Identification of clinically relevant molecular subtypes in colorectal cancer: the dawning of a new era.","abstract":"In recent years, a number of protein and genomic-based biomarkers have begun to refine the prognostic information available for colorectal cancer (CRC) and predict defined patient groups that are likely to benefit from systemic treatment or targeted therapies. Of these, KRAS represents the first biomarker integrated into clinical practice for CRC. Microarray-based gene expression profiling has been used to identify prognostic signatures and, to a lesser extent, predictive signatures in CRC. Despite these advances, a number of major challenges remain. This article, which is based on a lecture delivered as part of the 2013 Bob Pinedo Cancer Care Prize, reviews the impact of molecular biomarkers on the management of CRC, emphasizing changes that have occurred in recent years, and focuses on potential mechanisms of patient stratification and opportunities for novel therapeutic development based on enhanced biological understanding of colorectal cancer.
