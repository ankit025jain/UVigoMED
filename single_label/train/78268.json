{"id":78268,"title":"[Modern approaches to antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory photodynamic therapy in otorhinolaryngology].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to analyse the currently available methods and possibilities for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) in medicine with special reference to otorhinolaryngology. The results of the treatment of 300 patients with various suppurative ENT pathologies using antimicrobial PDT were subjected to the analysis. It made it possible to elucidate the mechanisms and parameters of photodynamic treatment and to reveal disadvantages of the modern methods of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. Special attention is given to the management of acute inflammation in the laryngopharynx and to the topical problems of up-to-date antimicrobial PDT.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724200","annotations":[{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.880269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.621832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.467274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
