{"id":76215,"title":"Childhood obesity in Asia: the value of accurate body composition methodology.","abstract":"?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????? ?IAEA?????????????????????????????? ????Childhood obesity, a significant global public health problem, affects an increasing number of low- and middle-income countries, including in Asia. The obesity epidemic has been fuelled by the rapid nutrition and physical activity transition with the availability of more energy-dense nutrient-poor foods and lifestyles of many children dominated by physical inactivity. During the growing years the pace and quality of grow this best quantified by a combination of anthropometric and body composition measures. However, where normative data are available, this has typically been collected on Caucasian children. To better define and characterise overweight and obesity in Asian children, and to monitor nutrition and physical activity interventions, there is a need to increase the use of standardized anthropometric and body composition methodologies. The current paper reports on initiatives facilitated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and outlines future research needs for the prevention and management of childhood obesity in Asia.
