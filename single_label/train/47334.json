{"id":47334,"title":"[Guideline 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease in children from 0-18 years'].","abstract":"In 2102, a multidiscplinary guideline was developed on behalf of the Dutch Association of Pediatrics entitled 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease in children from 0-18 years'. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guideline from 2009 served for guidance. History and physical examination are usually sufficient for diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is important to make a distinction between gastroesophageal reflux, a physiological phenomenon in children, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In practice, medications are provided too often, especially in infants. Only children suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease should be treated according to the therapeutical action plan.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594127","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.72,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.705518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.471864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.417786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.269459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"History","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Hepatology","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Action theory (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_theory_(philosophy)"}]}
