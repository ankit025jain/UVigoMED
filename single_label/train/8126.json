{"id":8126,"title":"Resistance to ?-lactam antibiotic may influence nanH gene expression in Trueperella pyogenes isolated from bovine endometritis.","abstract":"Virulence could be modulated by many instinctive and environmental factors including oxygen, osmolarity and antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between drug resistance and the nanH expression in Trueperella pyogenes (T. pyogenes). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 6 ?-lactam antimicrobial agents (penicillin G, amoxicillin, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftiofur, and ampicillin) against T. pyogenes were tested by standard broth dilution method according to the protocols of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was selected to investigate the mRNA expression levels of the nanH in T. pyogenes. All the isolates were resistant to atleast 2 of antimicrobial agents, and multidrug resistance (resistance to atleast 3 antimicrobials) was observed in 84.38% (27/32) of isolates. The mRNA expression levels of the nanH were significantly higher in comparison with that in ATCC19411, as the resistance profile enlarged, the nanH mRNA expression levels decreased in T. pyogenes. These results indicated that ?-lactam antibiotic resistance in T. pyogenes may alter the expression of the nanH.
