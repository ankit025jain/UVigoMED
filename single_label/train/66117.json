{"id":66117,"title":"[Clinical effects of tolvaptan for patients with stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease in cardiac surgery].","abstract":"We report clinical effects of tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, in cardiac surgery. Tolvaptan was administrated to 5 patients with non-dialysis dependent stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) during an early postoperative stage. Tolvaptan increased urine output and improved respiratory function in all patients without causing hemodynamic deterioration. All patients were able to avoid initiating long-term hemodialysis during hospital stay. Tolvaptan was effective and safe after cardiac surgery for patients with severe CKD.
