{"id":21755,"title":"Assessment of Mycobacterium bovis deleted in p27-p55 virulence operon as candidate vaccine against tuberculosis in animal models.","abstract":"A Mycobacterium bovis knockout in p27-p55 operon was tested as an antituberculosis experimental vaccine in animal models. The mutant Mb?p27-p55 was significantly more attenuated in nude mice than its parental strain but more virulent than BCG Pasteur. Challenge experiments in mice and guinea pigs using M. bovis or M. tuberculosis strains showed similar protection conferred by Mb?p27-p55 mutant than BCG in terms of pathology and bacterial loads in spleen but lower protection than BCG in lungs. When tested in cattle, Mb?p27-p55 did not induce IL-2 expression and induced a very low production of IFN?, suggesting that the lack of P27/P55 reduces the capacity of M. bovis of triggering an adequate Th1 response.
