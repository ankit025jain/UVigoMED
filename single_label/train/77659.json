{"id":77659,"title":"Occupational solvent exposure and risk of meningioma: results from the INTEROCC multicentre case-control study.","abstract":"To examine associations between occupational exposure to selected organic solvents and meningioma.A multicentre case-control study conducted in seven countries, including 1906 cases and 5565 controls. Occupational exposure to selected classes of organic solvents (aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons and 'other' organic solvents) or seven specific solvents (benzene, toluene, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, methylene chloride and gasoline) was assessed using lifetime occupational histories and a modified version of the FINJEM job-exposure matrix (INTEROCC-JEM). Study participants were classified as 'exposed' when they had worked in an occupation for at least 1 year, with a 5-year lag, in which the estimated prevalence of exposure was 25% or greater in the INTEROCC-JEM. Associations between meningioma and each of the solvent exposures were estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.A total of 6.5% of study participants were ever exposed to 'any' solvent, with a somewhat greater proportion of controls (7%) ever exposed compared with cases (5%), but only one case was ever exposed to any chlorinated hydrocarbon (1,1,1-trichloroethane). No association was observed between any of the organic solvents and meningioma, in either men or women, and no dose-response relationships were observed in internal analyses using either exposure duration or cumulative exposure.We found no evidence that occupational exposure to these organic solvents is associated with meningioma.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474387","annotations":[{"name":"Toluene","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene"},{"name":"Organochloride","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organochloride"},{"name":"Trichloroethylene","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichloroethylene"},{"name":"Benzene","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"},{"name":"Alicyclic compound","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicyclic_compound"},{"name":"Tetrachloroethylene","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachloroethylene"},{"name":"Dichloromethane","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloromethane"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"1,1,1-Trichloroethane","weight":0.812649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1,1-Trichloroethane"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Aliphatic compound","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliphatic_compound"},{"name":"Aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Chlorination","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorination"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.738156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Gasoline","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.531695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Methylene","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene"},{"name":"Occupational exposure limit","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_exposure_limit"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Turbocharger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
