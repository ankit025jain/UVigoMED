The associating factor that affected the sexual dysfunction significantly was observed in BMI group (p-value 0.033). Subgroup analysis illustrated that the underweight group had more sexual dysfunction. The lowest FSFI score was observed in the underweight group. The score was 23.50 +/- 4.52. The significant domains were found to be desirable and arousal domains.The prevalence of female sexual dysfunction in the period after IUD using was 50.9%.
