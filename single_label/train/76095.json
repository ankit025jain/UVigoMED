{"id":76095,"title":"Association between habitual daytime napping and metabolic syndrome: a population-based study.","abstract":"Our objective was to evaluate the association between habitual daytime napping and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.We conducted a population-based study of 8,547 subjects aged 40 years or older. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to a harmonized definition from a joint statement and the recommended thresholds for the Chinese population. Information about sleep duration was self-reported.The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the no daytime napping group, the 0 to 1 hour daytime napping group and the more than 1 hour daytime napping group were 35.0%, 36.0% and 44.5% among the females (P<0.0001). Increased daytime napping hours were positively associated with parameters of metabolic syndrome in the female subjects, including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose (P<0.05 for all). Multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that, compared to the no habitual daytime napping females, napping for more than 1 hour was independently associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.72). Compared to the female subjects in the no daytime napping group, those habitually napped for more than 1 hour exhibited 46% and 26% increases in the prevalence of central obesity and hypertriglyceridemia (all P<0.05). No statistically significant associations were detected between daytime napping hours and metabolic syndrome among the male subjects.Daytime napping is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged non-obese Chinese women.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249445","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.826325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.812017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.690256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.609057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.545335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.522519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.358333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.335907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.334985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.308333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0825297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
