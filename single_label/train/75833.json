{"id":75833,"title":"Improvement in social function and health-related quality of life after shunt surgery for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus.","abstract":"To investigate the impact of shunt surgery on the activity, participation, autonomy, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) as well as the effect on caregiver burden.Thirty-seven patients (median age 70 years, range 50-89 years) with iNPH were evaluated before and 6 months after surgery. Symptoms and signs were assessed by the iNPH scale, activities of daily living (ADL) with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), autonomy and participation with Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA), and caregiver burden with the Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS). HRQOL was evaluated with the EQ-5D (EuroQol Group-5 Dimension health survey).Twenty-four patients (65%) improved clinically (iNPH scale score) and 31 (86%) improved their HRQOL after surgery, almost to the same level as found in the normal population. The patients became more independent in physical and cognitive activities, and participation and autonomy improved. The caregiver burden was decreased among caregivers to male patients but remained unchanged on the overall group level.After shunt surgery, patients with iNPH showed improvement in most aspects of social life, they became more independent, and their quality of life returned to nearly normal.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036194","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.707107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.665677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.516807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.489038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.464644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0529744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Advanced Mobile Phone System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System"},{"name":"International Phonetic Alphabet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"},{"name":"CBS","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Finnish markka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_markka"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Equalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization"},{"name":"Anti-Defamation League","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League"},{"name":"Burden, Kansas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden,_Kansas"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
