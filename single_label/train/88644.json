{"id":88644,"title":"Classifying errors in preventable and potentially preventable trauma deaths: a 9-year review using the Joint Commission's standardized methodology.","abstract":"Benchmarking and classification of avoidable errors in trauma care are difficult as most reports classify errors using variable locally derived schemes. We sought to classify errors in a large trauma population using standardized Joint Commission taxonomy.All preventable/potentially preventable deaths identified at an urban, level-1 trauma center (January 2002 to December 2010) were abstracted from the trauma registry. Errors deemed avoidable were classified within the 5-node (impact, type, domain, cause, and prevention) Joint Commission taxonomy.Of the 377 deaths in 11,100 trauma contacts, 106 (7.7%) were preventable/potentially preventable deaths related to 142 avoidable errors. Most common error types were in clinical performance (inaccurate diagnosis). Error domain involved primarily the emergency department (therapeutic interventions), caused mostly by knowledge deficits. Communication improvement was the most common mitigation strategy.Standardized classification of errors in preventable trauma deaths most often involve clinical performance in the early phases of care and can be mitigated with universal strategies.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814306","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.648211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.307983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.299239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.25544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Joint Commission","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Commission"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.174309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Benchmarking","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Clinical governance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Errors (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_(band)"},{"name":"Balance of trade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Organization development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_development"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Scheme (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
