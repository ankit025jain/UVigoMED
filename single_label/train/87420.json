{"id":87420,"title":"An anatomical study of the entry point in the greater trochanter for intramedullary nailing.","abstract":"Malpositioning of the trochanteric entry point during the introduction of an intramedullary nail may cause iatrogenic fracture or malreduction. Although the optimal point of insertion in the coronal plane has been well described, positioning in the sagittal plane is poorly defined. The paired femora from 374 cadavers were placed both in the anatomical position and in internal rotation to neutralise femoral anteversion. A marker was placed at the apparent apex of the greater trochanter, and the lateral and anterior offsets from the axis of the femoral shaft were measured on anteroposterior and lateral photographs. Greater trochanteric morphology and trochanteric overhang were graded. The mean anterior offset of the apex of the trochanter relative to the axis of the femoral shaft was 5.1 mm (sd 4.0) and 4.6 mm (sd 4.2) for the anatomical and neutralised positions, respectively. The mean lateral offset of the apex was 7.1 mm (sd 4.6) and 6.4 mm (sd 4.6), respectively. Placement of the entry position at the apex of the greater trochanter in the anteroposterior view does not reliably centre an intramedullary nail in the sagittal plane. Based on our findings, the site of insertion should be about 5 mm posterior to the apex of the trochanter to allow for its anterior offset.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183603","annotations":[{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.915576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.768261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.739876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.659143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Greater trochanter","weight":0.650772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_trochanter"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.569594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.541319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.389924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Internal rotation","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rotation"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.287041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.167895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Arthropod leg","weight":0.121082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod_leg"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Anteversion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anteversion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Neutralization (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralization_(chemistry)"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Offsets","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offsets"},{"name":"Entry point","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_point"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
