{"id":37073,"title":"Optical coherence tomography: a quantitative tool to screen for papilledema in craniosynostosis.","abstract":"Our aim was to evaluate if optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used as an alternative for fundoscopy to screen for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with craniosynostosisWe performed a prospective cohort study at the Dutch Craniofacial Centre. We included 38 patients with nonsyndromic scaphocephaly and Crouzon's syndrome aged 3-8 years old, in whom we scored complaints suggestive of increased ICP and performed fundoscopy and OCT. Main outcome measures total retinal thickness (TRT) which was measured on 58 OCT scans.Forty-three percent of fundoscopies revealed pathologic changes of the papil in at least one eye. Retinal thickness was increased in patients with an abnormal fundoscopy as compared to patients with a normal papil (TRT p < 0.001). Patients with Crouzon's syndrome had a significantly increased retinal thickness as compared to patients with scaphocephaly (TRT p < 0.001).The current study demonstrates that OCT in children with craniosynostosis is feasible. It confirms that retinal thickness increases in case of papilledema. Given the quantitative character, OCT has a high potential as an alternative tool to screen for papilledema in craniosynostosis and other pediatric populations.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519451","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.877853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Papilledema","weight":0.806943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilledema"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.795373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.737676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.305461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.231403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Craniosynostosis","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniosynostosis"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Scaphocephaly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphocephaly"},{"name":"Turkish Radio and Television Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Radio_and_Television_Corporation"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Centre (French region)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(French_region)"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Nonsyndromic deafness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsyndromic_deafness"}]}
