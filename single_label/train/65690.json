{"id":65690,"title":"Health-related quality of life in the first year after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"To assess health-related quality of life in the first year after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy compared with that after open radical prostatectomy.The subjects were 105 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between January 2011 and June 2012. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score, Medical Outcome Study 8-Items Short Form Health Survey (SF-8) and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at baseline and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Comparisons were made with data for 107 consecutive patients treated with open radical prostatectomy between October 2005 and July 2007.The International Prostate Symptom Score change was similar in each group. The laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group had a better baseline Medical Outcome Study 8-Items Short Form Health Survey mental component summary score and a better Medical Outcome Study 8-Items Short Form Health Survey physical component summary score at 1 month after surgery. In Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, obstructive/irritative symptoms did not differ between the groups, but urinary incontinence was worse until 12 months after surgery and particularly severe after 1 month in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group. The rate of severe urinary incontinence was much higher in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group in the early period. Urinary bother was worse in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group at 1 and 3 months, but did not differ between the groups thereafter. Urinary function and bother were good after nerve sparing procedures and did not differ between the groups. Bowel and sexual function and bother were similar in the two groups.Urinary function in the first year after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is worse than that after open radical prostatectomy.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791781","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.837674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.516275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0227032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"The International (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(film)"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Bihar Legislative Assembly election, October 2005","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_October_2005"}]}
