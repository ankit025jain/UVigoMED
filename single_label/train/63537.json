{"id":63537,"title":"The utility of newer imaging techniques as predictors of clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma.","abstract":"The 14th International Myeloma Workshop Kyoto, Japan, 3-7 April 2013 The International Myeloma Workshop (IMW) is a biannual meeting that gathers experts in multiple myeloma (MM) from all over the world and scientists interested in clinical and biological aspects of myeloma. The 2013 IMW was held in Kyoto, Japan and presented an interesting program with an appealing section on newer imaging techniques as predictor of outcome in asymptomatic and symptomatic MM. During the meeting, the importance of newer functional imaging techniques as new ways of assessing bone disease and the extent of marrow infiltration by myeloma cells was highlighted. This short meeting report will provide a review of new and/or functional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both axial and whole body (WB-MRI), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and PET integrated with computed tomography.
