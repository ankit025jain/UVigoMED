{"id":9108,"title":"Single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Experimental studies of Alzheimer's disease have largely depended on transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP). These mice, however, suffer from artificial phenotypes because, in addition to amyloid ? peptide (A?), they overproduce other APP fragments. We generated knock-in mice that harbor Swedish and Beyreuther/Iberian mutations with and without the Arctic mutation in the APP gene. The mice showed typical A? pathology, neuroinflammation and memory impairment in an age-dependent manner.
