{"id":63420,"title":"Long-term follow-up of imatinib in pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Children's Oncology Group study AALL0031.","abstract":"We previously reported preliminary findings that post induction imatinib mesylate (340?mg/m(2)/day), in combination with intensive chemotherapy, resulted in outcomes similar to blood and marrow transplant (BMT) for pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We now report 5-year outcomes of imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy in 91 children (1-21 years) with and without allogeneic BMT (N=91). We explore the impacts of additional chromosomal abnormalities and minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry on outcomes. The 5-year disease-free survival was similar for Cohort 5 patients, treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib (70%±12%, n=28), sibling donor BMT patients (65%±11%, n=21) and unrelated donor BMT patients (59±15%; P=0.60, n=13). Patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities had worse outcomes (P=0.05). End induction (pre-imatinib) MRD was not prognostic for Cohort 5 or allogeneic BMT patients, although limited by small numbers. The re-induction rate following relapse was similar to other higher-risk ALL groups. Longer-term follow-up confirms our initial observation of substantially good outcomes for children and adolescents with Ph+ ALL treated with imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy with no advantage for allogeneic BMT.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441288","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Philadelphia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"}]}
