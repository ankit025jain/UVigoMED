{"id":20836,"title":"Diagnosis and management of nail disorders in children.","abstract":"The authors herein describe several nail conditions, which the general pediatrician is likely to encounter in the course of routine practice. Because pediatric nail disorders represent a limited component of a general pediatric practice, it can be challenging for practitioners to establish expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions and to recognize when reassurance is appropriate or when referral to a specialist is necessary. This article summarizes the anatomy of the normal nail unit, as well as the evaluation and management of onychomycosis, melanonychia, trachyonychia, onychomadesis, and nail pitting.
