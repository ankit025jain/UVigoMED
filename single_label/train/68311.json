{"id":68311,"title":"?-Tocopheryl succinate pre-treatment attenuates quinone toxicity in prostate cancer PC3 cells.","abstract":"?-Tocopheryl succinate is one of the most effective analogues of vitamin E for inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell death in a variety of cancerous cell lines while sparing normal cells or tissues. ?Tocopheryl succinate inhibits oxidative phosphorylation at the level of mitochondrial complexes I and II, thus enhancing reactive oxygen species generation which, in turn, induces the expression of Nrf2-driven antioxidant/detoxifying genes. The cytoprotective role of Nrf2 downstream genes/proteins prompted us to investigate whether and how ?-tocopheryl succinate increases resistance of PC3 prostate cancer cells to pro-oxidant damage. A 4h ?-tocopheryl succinate pre-treatment increases glutathione intracellular content, indicating that the vitamin E derivative is capable of training the cells to react to an oxidative insult. We found that ?-tocopheryl succinate pre-treatment does not enhance paraquat-/hydroquinone-induced cytotoxicity whereas it exhibits an additional/synergistic effect on H?O??/docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity. While glutathione and heme oxygenase-1 are not involved in ?-tocopheryl succinate-induced adaptive response to paraquat,quinone oxidoreductase seems to be responsible, at least in part, for the lack of the additional response. Silencing the gene and/or the inhibition ofquinone oxidoreductase activity counteracts the ?-tocopheryl succinate-induced adaptive response. In conclusion, the adaptive response to ?-tocopheryl succinate shows that the activation of Nrf2 can promote the survival of cancer cells in an unfavourable environment.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530478","annotations":[{"name":"Oxidative phosphorylation","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_phosphorylation"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Quinone","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinone"},{"name":"Heme","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Oxidoreductase","weight":0.818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidoreductase"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pro-oxidant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-oxidant"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.509539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.442974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.339783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Paraquat","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraquat"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.26286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Heme oxygenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme_oxygenase"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"}]}
