{"id":62676,"title":"A miR-SNP of the KRT81 gene is associated with the prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","abstract":"MicroRNA (miRNA), which plays an important role in tumorigenesis, can regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of messenger RNAs and repressing its translation. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered to have significant impacts on susceptibility of the role these genetic polymorphisms in development of carcinogenesis through that mechanism. But few of them focus their impact on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the associations between the genetic variants and cancer risk or cancer outcome. MiRNA-related single nucleotide polymorphism (miR-SNP) sites rs3660 of KRT81, rs1044129 of RYR3, rs4901706 of f101, and rs1053667 of KIAA0423 were selected and analyzed in 210 patients in NHL to evaluate their association with cancer risk and prognosis. The results indicated that none of them is associated with the cancer risk in NHL. Otherwise KRT81 rs3660 GG type is associated with a shorter survival time (p=0.012), after being assessed by multivariate Cox analyses, its effect on prognosis was verified (p=0.003). It suggests that KRT81 rs3660 GG type is an independent prognostic marker in NHL.
