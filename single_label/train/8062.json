{"id":8062,"title":"Isolation and characterization of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) from grouper, Epinephelus tauvina.","abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is one of the key adapter molecules in Toll-like receptor signal transduction that triggers downstream cascades involved in innate immunity. In the present study, a TRAF6 (named as Et-TRAF6) was identified from the marine fish grouper, Epinephelus tauvina by RACE PCR. The full-length cDNA of Et-TRAF6 comprised 1949 bp with a 1713 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a putative protein of 570 amino acids. Similar to most TRAF6s, Et-TRAF6 includes one N-terminal RING domain (78aa-116aa), two zinc fingers of TRAF-type (159aa-210aa and 212aa-269aa), one coiled-coil region (370aa-394aa), and one conserved C-terminal meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain (401aa-526aa). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that Et-TRAF6 mRNA is expressed in all tested tissues, with the predominant expression in the stomach and intestine. The expression of Et-TRAF6 was up-regulated in the liver after challenge with Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), Peptidoglycan (PGN), Zymosan, polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)] and Polydeoxyadenylic acid Â· Polythymidylic acid sodium salt [Poly(dA:dT)]. The expression of Et-TRAF6 was also up-regulated in the liver after infection with Vibrio alginolyticus, Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and grouper nervous necrosis virus (GNNV). Recombinant Et-TRAF6 (rEt-TRAF6) was expressed in Escherichia BL21 (DE3) and purified for mouse anti-Et-TRAF6 serum preparation. Intracellular localization revealed that Et-TRAF6 is distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and predominantly in the cytoplasm. These results together indicated that Et-TRAF6 might be involved in immune responses toward bacterial and virus challenges.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Animal
