{"id":85090,"title":"[The role of modern echocardiography methods in diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension].","abstract":"The review contains presentation of diagnostic possibilities of contemporary echocardiographic techniques for investigation of structural functional state of the right ventricle and various methods of estimation of pulmonary artery pressure. Normative values of various parameters are adduced according to last recommendations of European and American Electrocardiography Societies. An algorithm of examination of patients with various severity of pulmonary hypertension comprising the use of novel echocardiographic technologies is suggested.
