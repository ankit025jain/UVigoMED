{"id":4134,"title":"[Indications and execution of enteral nutrition].","abstract":"Enteral nutrition refers to the administration of nutritional supplements or tube feeding into the gastrointestinal tract. It is important to recognize a patient who is undernourished or at risk of developing malnutrition. The most common indication of tube feeding is dysphagia caused either by a neurologic or a mechanical problem, whereas contraindications include acute problems of the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. obstruction or perforation of the bowel, or abdominal compartment syndrome before a corrective procedure. Tube feeding of a longer duration can be performed directly through the abdominal wall with a tube inserted endoscopically into the gastrointestinal tract. Tube feeding is started moderately and planned according to the patient's nutritional and fluid requirement.","date":"2015-01-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25582020","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.823181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.68701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.661584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.331913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.118236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0652231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Compartment syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome"},{"name":"Abdominal compartment syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_compartment_syndrome"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"London Underground","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Indication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
