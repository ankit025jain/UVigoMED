{"id":33778,"title":"Radiologic evaluation and management of postoperative spine paraspinal fluid collections.","abstract":"Postoperative paraspinal fluid collections can present a management dilemma to both radiologists and surgeons. Although many of these collections present as incidental findings and are unrelated to the presenting signs and symptoms that led to the imaging study, certain collections in the context of the appropriate clinical scenario may require additional evaluation and even emergent intervention. This article reviews those collections that are most frequently encountered and suggests management strategies that may assist in the evaluation and management of the patient.
