{"id":82404,"title":"Gingival and localized alveolar bone necrosis related to the use of arsenic trioxide paste--two case reports.","abstract":"The leakage of arsenic trioxide paste from tooth fillings has been associated with widespread necrosis of the supporting periodontal tissues. This report describes two cases of arsenic trioxide paste-induced gingival and localized alveolar bone necrosis in the mandible, following the use of arsenic trioxide paste as a pulp-devitalized agent. The first case was a 54-year-old female complaining of a painful white patch on the gingival tissue of the left mandibular second molar (tooth #37) after treatment by a private dentist. She underwent completely debridement of all necrotic soft tissue with physical saline irrigation. The gingival tissue was gradually replaced with vascular tissue and completely healed after 7 weeks. The second case was a 30-year-old female complaining of severe pain and continuous gingival bleeding from the right maxillary first bicuspid (tooth #14) following treatment by a private dentist. She finally accepted debridement of the sequestrum and necrotic alveolar bone with decortication to induce active bleeding. A partial thickness gingival flap was made to cover the wound. Four weeks later, the supporting tissues had completely healed. Arsenic trioxide paste is a cytotoxic agent and may cause harmful adverse effects on adjacent periodontium and supporting hard tissue if leakage occurs, or it is used carelessly. There is no indication for the use of arsenic trioxide paste in modern dental practice.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630037","annotations":[{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.878799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Mandibular second molar","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_second_molar"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.727753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.700562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.638861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.607401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.591951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.554502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.550277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.516654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.266956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Maxillary second molar","weight":0.0709418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_second_molar"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
