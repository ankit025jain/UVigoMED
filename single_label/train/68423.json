{"id":68423,"title":"Dosimetric considerations to determine the optimal technique for localized prostate cancer among external photon, proton, or carbon-ion therapy and high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate brachytherapy.","abstract":"To assess the dosimetric differences among volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), scanned proton therapy (intensity-modulated proton therapy, IMPT), scanned carbon-ion therapy (intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy, IMIT), and low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) treatment of localized prostate cancer.Ten patients were considered for this planning study. For external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), planning target volume was created by adding a margin of 5 mm (lateral/anterior-posterior) and 8 mm (superior-inferior) to the clinical target volume. Bladder wall (BW), rectal wall (RW), femoral heads, urethra, and pelvic tissue were considered as organs at risk. For VMAT and IMPT, 78 Gy(relative biological effectiveness, RBE)/2 Gy were prescribed. The IMIT was based on 66 Gy(RBE)/20 fractions. The clinical target volume planning aims for HDR-BT ((192)Ir) and LDR-BT ((125)I) were D(90%) ?34 Gy in 8.5 Gy per fraction and D(90%) ?145 Gy. Both physical and RBE-weighted dose distributions for protons and carbon-ions were converted to dose distributions based on 2-Gy(IsoE) fractions. From these dose distributions various dose and dose-volume parameters were extracted.Rectal wall exposure 30-70 Gy(IsoE) was reduced for IMIT, LDR-BT, and HDR-BT when compared with VMAT and IMPT. The high-dose region of the BW dose-volume histogram above 50 Gy(IsoE) of IMPT resembled the VMAT shape, whereas all other techniques showed a significantly lower high-dose region. For all 3 EBRT techniques similar urethra D(mean) around 74 Gy(IsoE) were obtained. The LDR-BT results were approximately 30 Gy(IsoE) higher, HDR-BT 10 Gy(IsoE) lower. Normal tissue and femoral head sparing was best with BT.Despite the different EBRT prescription and fractionation schemes, the high-dose regions of BW and RW expressed in Gy(IsoE) were on the same order of magnitude. Brachytherapy techniques were clearly superior in terms of BW, RW, and normal tissue sparing, with lowest values for HDR-BT.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521685","annotations":[{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Proton therapy","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Photon","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.809037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.770647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.763082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.689321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.464378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.200227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Relative biological effectiveness","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_biological_effectiveness"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Iridium","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium"},{"name":"Iodine-125","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-125"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0466241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Histogram","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram"},{"name":"Order of magnitude","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Biological warfare","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
