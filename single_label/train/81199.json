{"id":81199,"title":"Integrating techniques to re-establish dentogingival esthetics.","abstract":"The aim of this article was to report the clinical case of a male patient of 20 years with hyperpigmented gingiva and moderate fluorosis, whose smile was reestablished by the use of a laser assisted depigmentation procedure, an enamel microabrasion technique, followed by at-home bleaching and subsequent remineralization therapy. The association of these techniques presented excellent results and the patient was satisfied. All techniques are painless, fast and easy to perform, in addition to preserving the hard and soft dental structure. Treatment showed immediate and permanent results; these techniques must be divulged among professionals and their patients.
