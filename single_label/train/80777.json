{"id":80777,"title":"Liposomal formulation of amphotericin B for the treatment of mucosal leishmaniasis in HIV-negative patients.","abstract":"Studies assessing the efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) in the treatment of patients with mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) are very scarce in the literature and an optimal dose regimen has not yet been defined.We performed a retrospective and descriptive analysis from records of 16 patients with ML treated with LAB. The mean daily dose of LAB was 2.5 mg/kg/day.Healing of the lesion was observed in 14 (88%) of the 16 patients. The mean cumulative doses, excluding the two treatment failures, were 2265 mg and 33 mg/kg.Liposomal amphotericin B in the cumulative dose of 30 to 35 mg/kg was able to achieve 100% effectiveness.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535153","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.407213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.391152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.193782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.047465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"ML (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"}]}
