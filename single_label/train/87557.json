{"id":87557,"title":"Multistrand titanium cable for the coracoclavicular stabilization of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation.","abstract":"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the outcome of the surgical treatment of acute complete acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation with multistrand titanium cable for coracoclavicular (CC) stabilization. Forty-two patients with acute complete AC joint dislocation, Rockwood III, IV, V, were treated with CC stabilization using multistrand titanium cable. Thirty-nine patients could be evaluated after a mean follow-up period of 42 months (range, 34-60). The mean VAS score improved from 5.6 +/- 1.5 to 0.4 +/- 1.2 (p < 0.05). The mean Constant score from 64.8 +/- 8.9 preoperatively to 95.3 +/- 9.3 (p < 0.05). Radiographs showed anatomical reduction in 32 out of 39 patients. Cable breakage occurred in 2 patients. CC stabilization with multistrand titanium cables is an effective and safe alternative to other procedures. This procedure provides immediate joint stabilization and allows early mobilization with satisfying functional recovery.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090789","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.405556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.387256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Acromioclavicular joint","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_joint"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.197954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Alternating current","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Separated shoulder","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_shoulder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Cable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coracoclavicular ligament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoclavicular_ligament"}]}
