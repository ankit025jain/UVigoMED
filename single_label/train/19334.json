{"id":19334,"title":"A challenging case of septic sacroiliitis with psoas involvement.","abstract":"We report on a rare case of septic arthritis of the sacroiliac joint in a young patient without apparent predisposing factors.A 22-year-old female presented with severe right pelvic and gluteal pain and systemic illness. She had a recent diagnosis of bilateral sacroiliitis.Systemic illness quickly subsided after initiation of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Subsequently, gluteal pain gradually diminished.Pyogenic sacroiliitis should be taken into account in patients with sacroiliitis and fever onset. Magnetic resonance imaging shows signal anomalies well beyond disappearance of symptoms, which may or may not require prolonged antibiotic therapy.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724755","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Sacroiliac joint","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.753863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.556875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.456946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Sacroiliitis","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliitis"},{"name":"Pyogenic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyogenic"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"}]}
