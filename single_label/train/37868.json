{"id":37868,"title":"Transcatheter closure of late-onset residual aortopulmonary septal defect using a muscular ventricular septal occluder.","abstract":"Late-onset residual shunt after surgical repair of aortopulmonary septal defect (APSD) is a rare event complicating the management strategy. Surgical reoperation was the treatment of choice traditionally, while associated with increased risk and suffering. We report a case of successful treatment of this type of residual shunt using a transcatheter closure technique with an infrequently used muscular ventricular septal device.
