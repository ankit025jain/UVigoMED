{"id":87475,"title":"Imaging of current spinal hardware: lumbar spine.","abstract":"The purposes of this article are to review the indications for and the materials and designs of hardware more commonly used in the lumbar spine; to discuss alternatives for each of the types of hardware; to review normal postoperative imaging findings; to describe the appropriateness of different imaging modalities for postoperative evaluation; and to show examples of hardware complications.Stabilization and fusion of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disk replacement, artificial ligaments, spinous process distraction devices, plate-and-rod systems, dynamic posterior fusion devices, and newer types of material incorporation are increasingly more common in contemporary surgical practice. These spinal hardware devices will be seen more often in radiology practice. Successful postoperative radiologic evaluation of this spinal hardware necessitates an understanding of fundamental hardware design, physiologic objectives, normal postoperative imaging appearances, and unique complications. Radiologists may have little training and experience with the new and modified types of hardware used in the lumbar spine.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148159","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.777657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.521449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.508502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.498222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.434985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.310378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.1216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Spinous process","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinous_process"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"CPU design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_design"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Hard disk drive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive"},{"name":"Personal computer hardware","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer_hardware"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"}]}
