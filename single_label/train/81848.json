{"id":81848,"title":"Case report: sublingual epidermoid cyst in an elderly patient.","abstract":"The occurrence of epidermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth is uncommon, particularly in elderly patients. We present the case of a 77-year-old female, who presented with minimal symptoms, despite a large floor-of-mouth swelling, which obscured her tongue from vision. The mass was removed via an intraoral approach under local anaesthesia (LA) and intravenous (IV) sedation, keeping complications and recovery time to a minimum. The mass was revealed to be an epidermoid cyst and the patient made a swift recovery. The features and classification of these cysts are discussed.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812760","annotations":[{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.749179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.672162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.657947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.553878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.369501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.341334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.338059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Epidermoid cyst","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermoid_cyst"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Swift","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift"}]}
