{"id":46386,"title":"Risk factors of bile leakage after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To identify the risk factors for postoperative biliary complications after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.The subjects were 123 patients who underwent hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between January 2006 and December 2010. Perioperative factors related to postoperative bile leakage were studied.Postoperative bile leakage occurred in eight (6.5%) of the patients. Univariate analysis showed that liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (p=0.007), long operation time (>5 hours) (p=0.002), major hepatic resection (p=0.024) and hepatectomy including Couinaud's segment 4 (p=0.0078) or segment 5 (p=0.023) were associated with an incidence of bile leakage. From multivariate analysis, operation time (relative risk=6.10, p=0.026) or resection of segment 4 (relative risk=6.86, p=0.017) were found to be independent risk factors for bile leakage.Prolonged operation time and hepatectomy including segment 4 led to a high risk for postoperative bile leakage in this series of patients.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634941","annotations":[{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.820631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.676338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.661902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.577698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.345053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.339873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.290004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.241472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
