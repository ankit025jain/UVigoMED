{"id":52762,"title":"[Thyroid hormone action beyond classical concepts. The priority programme \"Thyroid Trans Act\" (SPP 1629) of the German Research Foundation].","abstract":"Thyroid hormones are of crucial importance for the function of nearly all organ systems. In case of dysfunction of thyroid hormone production and function many organ systems may be affected. The estimation of normal thyroid function is based on determination of TSH and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. However, international conventions about the normal TSH range are still lacking which bears consequences for patient`s treatment. Hence not unexpected, many patients complain although their thyroid hormone status is in the normal range by clinical estimation. Here, more precise parameters are needed for a better definition of the healthy thyroid status of an individual. Recently, new key players in the system of thyroid hormone action were detected, like specific transporters for uptake of thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone derivatives. DFG, the German Research Foundation supports the priority program Thyroid Trans Act to find answers to the main question: what defines the healthy thyroid status of an individual. The overall aim of this interdisciplinary research consortium is to specify physiological and pathophysiological functions of thyroid hormone transporters and thyroid hormone derivative as new players in thyroid regulation in order to better evaluate, treat, and prevent thyroid-related disease.
