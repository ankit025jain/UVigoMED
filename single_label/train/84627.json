{"id":84627,"title":"Assessing reverse 911®: a case study of the 2007 San Diego wildfires.","abstract":"In October 2007, 250,000 residents of San Diego County were forced to evacuate as wildfires burned 62 miles(2) in 24 hours. In 2005, the Sheriff's Department invested in Reverse 911® to contact residents upon emergencies. The system was used during this wildfire, and by the following midday, had made 394,915 calls. Shortly thereafter, 1,210 residents were surveyed to investigate the effectiveness of this technology. Findings reveal that 42 percent of respondents received their first warning from a Reverse 911® call while an additional 7 percent received the same call, but not as their first warning, as compared to all other methods used.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069025","annotations":[{"name":"Wildfire","weight":0.764248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire"},{"name":"San Diego County, California","weight":0.756172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_County,_California"},{"name":"San Diego","weight":0.265723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego"},{"name":"Reverse 911","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_911"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Emergency evacuation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Sheriff","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff"},{"name":"394","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/394"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"915","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/915"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"}]}
