{"id":56047,"title":"Confocal microscopy evaluation of the corneal response following AcuFocus KAMRA inlay implantation.","abstract":"To describe the corneal appearance on confocal microscopy after AcuFocus KAMRA Inlay (AcuFocus, Inc., Irvine, CA) implantation and evaluate the visual acuity compared to the confocal microscopy data.Twelve eyes of 12 patients implanted with one of three models of the AcuFocus KAMRA Inlay (ACI 7000, 7000T, and 7000PDT) were prospectively evaluated by confocal microscopy 6 months after implantation. Additionally, 4 eyes of 4 patients explanted during the follow-up period were evaluated.Among the eyes implanted, mean epithelial thickness was 54.6 ± 22 ?m. The subbasal nerve plexus was detected in 10 patients. The corneal nerves per unit area were 2.73 ± 2.1 sprouts/mm(2). The branch pattern was found in 8 patients. The mean keratocyte density value was 540 ± 210 cells/mm(2). A low grade of keratocyte activation was found in all patients. Among the eyes explanted, the mean wound healing opacity was 1,092.75 ± 1,877.35 ?m/pixel.The corneal tolerance to the KAMRA Inlay appeared to be good. The inlay modified the normal structure of the corneal layer, but it was not associated with severe complications of the eye. Keratocyte activation was the finding most associated with a negative visual outcome. Confocal microscopy can be useful to evaluate the long-term evolution of the corneal layer changes following KAMRA Inlay implantation.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye
