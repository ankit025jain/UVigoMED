{"id":79657,"title":"[Investigation on field feces in schistosomiasis endemic areas in Jingzhou City].","abstract":"To understand the status of field feces in Jingzhou City, so as to provide the evidence for improving the control measures to interrupt the transmission routes of schistosomiasis.The distribution of field feces was investigated in 27 schistosomiasis endemic villages in Gong' an, Jianli, Jiangling, Honghu and Shishou counties (cities) from 2010 to 2012. The schistosome positive status of the field feces was surveyed with the hatching method.There were 1366 field feces and the average density was 0.0892 feces per 100 square meters in this survey. The cattle feces, human feces, dog feces and elk feces respectively accounted for 99.71%, 0.07%, 0.15% and 0.07% in the survey. The infection rates of the field feces were 1.46% and 2.42% in the channels and bottomlands, respectively (P > 0.05). The average rate of infected field feces was 3.21% in 2010, 0.36% in 2011, and 1.60% in 2012, and the difference between 2010 and 2012 was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).The main field feces come from cattle, and the main distribution of infected field feces is in channels and bottom-lands. Therefore, the management of cattle and treatment of field feces should be strengthened.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051837","annotations":[{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.717865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.544298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.513038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.458083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Elk","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.298387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Square metre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Jingzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingzhou"},{"name":"Jiangling County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangling_County"},{"name":"Shishou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishou"},{"name":"Honghu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honghu"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"1366","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1366"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gong (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_(band)"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_and_lowland_(freshwater_ecology)"},{"name":"Hatching system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching_system"},{"name":"Interrupt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"}]}
