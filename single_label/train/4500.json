{"id":4500,"title":"[Apoptosis and necrosis of lymphocytes induced by UV-radiation in the presence of autological plasma].","abstract":"The influence of UV-light (240-390 nm) in doses 151-3020 J/m2 on the nature of the death of lymphocytes cells of donor's blood (using markers of apoptotic and necrotic death of cells) and on the level of expression of the marker of apoptotic pre-preparation--CD95-receptor has been investigated. We have shown that UV-radiation increases expression of CD95-receptors which is caused mainly by de novo synthesis of the receptors. It has been revealed that during daily incubation of photo-modified lymphocytes (151 and 755 J/m2) without autological blood cell death occurs by receptor-involved apoptosis. Exposure to high doses of radiation (1510 and 3020 J/m2) causes massive necrotic death of immunocytes. The use of autologous blood plasma during incubation of photo-modified lymphocytes allows decreasing the number of both apoptotic and necrotic cells.","date":"2014-12-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509146","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Fas receptor","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"De novo","weight":0.0978921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"De novo synthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_synthesis"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"755","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/755"},{"name":"1510","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1510"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Autological word","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word"}]}
