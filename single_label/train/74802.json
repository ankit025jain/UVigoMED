{"id":74802,"title":"[Auricular acupuncture for primary insomnia: a systematic review based on GRADE system].","abstract":"The clinical efficacy and safety of auricular acupuncture (AA) for treatment of primary insomnia was evaluated. After a comprehensive retrieval in domestic and foreign databases, literatures were strictly screened and Revman 5.2 software was applied to perform a Meta-analysis on eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The evidence quality was assessed with GRADE profiler 3.6 software. As a result, 8 articles were included involving 894 patients. Compared among AA and sham AA, placebo AA, blank control, there was significant difference in Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) [WMD = -3.48, 95% CI (-3.96, -3.00)], sleep latency LWMD = -10.14, 95% CI (-17.16, -3.12)] and sleep awakening times [WMD = -9.98, 95% CI (-1.10,-0.48)]. Compared between AA and western medication, there was significant difference in PSQI [WMD = -3.62, 95% CI (-4.59, -2.65)]. The evidence quality was moderate in AA vs. sham AA, placebo AA or blank control, while that of the rest was extremely low. No reports of adverse events were described in all studies. In conclusion, for the treatment of primary insomnia, AA could effectively improve sleep quality, but due to the low evidence quality, cautious attitude should be taken on this conclusion, and clinical trials with large sample and high quality were needed in the further.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233674","annotations":[{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.50668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Sleep onset latency","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_onset_latency"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.347521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"894","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/894"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Wakefulness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness"},{"name":"Blank (cartridge)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_(cartridge)"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Offender profiling","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offender_profiling"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Sham surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sham_surgery"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"},{"name":"Pittsburgh","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh"}]}
