{"id":88912,"title":"A nine-year review of medicolegal claims in neurosurgery.","abstract":"Neurosurgery remains among the highest malpractice risk specialties. This study aimed to identify areas in neurosurgery associated with litigation, attendant causes and costs.Retrospective analysis was conducted of 42 closed litigation cases treated by neurosurgeons at one hospital between March 2004 and March 2013. Data included clinical event, timing and reason for claim, operative course and legal outcome.Twenty-nine claims were defended out of court and twelve were settled out of court. One case required court attendance and was defended. Of the 42 claims, 28, 13 and 1 related to spinal (0.3% of caseload), cranial (0.1% of caseload) and peripheral nerve (0.07% of caseload) surgery respectively. The most common causes of claims were faulty surgical technique (43%), delayed diagnosis/misdiagnosis (17%), lack of information (14%) and delayed treatment (12%), with a likelihood of success of 39%, 29%, 17% and 20% respectively. The highest median payouts were for claims against faulty surgical technique (£230,000) and delayed diagnosis/misdiagnosis (£212,650). The mean delay between clinical event and claim was 664 days.Spinal surgery carries the highest litigation risk versus cranial and peripheral nerve surgery. Claims are most commonly against faulty surgical technique and delayed diagnosis/misdiagnosis, which have the highest success rates and payouts. In spinal surgery, the most common cause of claims is faulty surgical technique. In cranial surgery, the most common cause is lack of information. Claims may occur years after the clinical event, necessitating thorough contemporaneous documentation for adequate future defence. We emphasise thorough patient consultation and meticulous surgical technique to minimise litigation in neurosurgical practice.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780016","annotations":[{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.549091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.54666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Malpractice","weight":0.515183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpractice"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.473639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.153015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.152018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0572894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.0291129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"650","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/650"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Defense (legal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Settlement (litigation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
