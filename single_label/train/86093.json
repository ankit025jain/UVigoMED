{"id":86093,"title":"Effects of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C on invasion, proliferation and cell cycling of lung cancer cells.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to investigate the influence of ubiquitin- conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) on biological behavior of lung cancer cells. Using MTT, flow cytometry and invasion assays, we detected UBE2C expression and evaluated its biological properties in these cells, including effects on proliferation, the cell cycle profile and invasive capability. Compared with control cells, the UBE2C transfected cells demonstrated increased cellular proliferation (p<0.05). UBE2C transfected cells also had a lower percentage in G1 phase and a higher percentage in S phase (p<0.05). Importantly, the UBE2C transfected cells had a notable enhancement of cell numbers penetrating the basement membrane compared with the control group (p<0.05). Ectopic up- regulation UBE2C promoted the growth of lung cancer cells in vivo. Furthermore, we found UBE2C increased the expression of cyclin D1 and MMP-2. These results show UBE2C may represent a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.
