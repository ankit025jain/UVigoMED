{"id":53634,"title":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with aortic valve sclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Recent epidemiological data suggest that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with aortic valve sclerosis (AVS), an emerging risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic individuals. To date, nobody has investigated the association between NAFLD and AVS in people with type 2 diabetes, a group of individuals in which the prevalence of these two diseases is high.We recruited 180 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients without ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hepatic diseases or excessive alcohol consumption. NAFLD was diagnosed by liver ultrasonography whereas AVS was determined by conventional echocardiography in all participants. In the whole sample, 120 (66.7%) patients had NAFLD and 53 (29.4%) had AVS. No patients had aortic stenosis. NAFLD was strongly associated with an increased risk of prevalent AVS (odds ratio [OR] 2.79, 95% CI 1.3-6.1, p<0.01). Adjustments for age, sex, duration of diabetes, diabetes treatment, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hemoglobin A1c and estimated glomerular filtration rate did not attenuate the strong association between NAFLD and risk of prevalent AVS (adjusted-OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.3-7.3, p?=?0.01).Our results provide the first demonstration of a positive and independent association between NAFLD and AVS in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System
