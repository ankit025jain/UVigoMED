It is shown that perineal saturation biopsy provides high detection rate of prostate cancer in patients with suspected cancer after negative transrectal biopsies, does not increase the detection of clinically insignificant cancer and incidence of complications, but requires a lot of time and cost.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772772","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.267874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Negative (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)"},{"name":"Colorfulness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0156195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"}]}
