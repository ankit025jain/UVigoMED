{"id":79480,"title":"Probiotic manipulation of the chronic rhinosinusitis microbiome.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a key pathogenic component of the chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) microbiome and is associated with increased disease severity and poor postoperative outcomes. Probiotic treatments potentially offer a novel approach to the management of pathogenic bacteria in these recalcitrant patients through supporting a healthy community of commensal species. This study aims to investigate the probiotic properties of Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) against SA in a mouse model of sinusitis.Twenty C57/BL6 mice received intranasal inoculations of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), SE, SA, or a combination of SE and SA (SE+SA) for 3 days. Following euthanasia, the mouse snouts were harvested and prepared for histological analysis. Counts of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive goblet cells were the primary outcome measure.Goblet cell counts were significantly higher in both the SA and SE+SA groups compared to those receiving PBS or SE alone (p < 0.05). However, the SE+SA group demonstrated significantly lower goblet cell counts compared to the SA group (p < 0.05). Mice receiving SE alone did not show a significant difference to those receiving PBS (p > 0.05). The presence of SA postinoculation was confirmed by culture in both the SA and SE+SA groups.This study confirms the probiotic potential of SE against SA in a mouse model of sinusitis. Although the interactions that occur between many probiotic species and pathogens are yet to be fully understood, studies such as this support further exploration of ecologically-based treatment paradigms for the management of CRS.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415658","annotations":[{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.843004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.803216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.666424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.650038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.602344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.494907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Staphylococcus epidermidis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_epidermidis"},{"name":"Euthanasia","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"},{"name":"Goblet cell","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chalice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalice"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Microbiome","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome"}]}
