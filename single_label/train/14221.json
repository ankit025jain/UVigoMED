{"id":14221,"title":"Double-strand adeno-associated virus-mediated exendin-4 expression in salivary glands is efficient in a diabetic rat model.","abstract":"Exendin-4 (Ex-4) is an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor, approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Several strategies have been tried to develop stable and efficacious Ex-4 expression systems. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether double-stranded adeno-associated virus (dsAAV)-mediated in vivo expression of exendin-4 in salivary glands (SG), improves pathology in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model of diabetes mellitus (DM).The effects of Ex-4 expression by recombinant dsAAV-NT4-Ex-4 were evaluated in vitro compared with a single-strand (ss) AAV. The dsAAV was delivered into SGs and the blood glucose and insulin levels were assessed in a rat model of DM.DsAAV-NT4-Ex-4 virus induces significant exendin-4 expression in vitro. Furthermore, Ex-4 expressed from dsAAV virus in SGs enhances insulins secretion in vivo and significantly controls the onset of hyperglycemia in rat model of DM.Results suggest that sustained secretion of Ex-4 following dsAAV-mediated gene therapy is feasible. SGs appear to be promising targets with potential clinical applicability for the treatment of DM. This represents the example of a successful use of Ex-4 for diabetes therapy, providing support for direct AAV-mediated in vivo as an easy, safe and efficient therapeutic strategy.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438876","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.582708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.538096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.461115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.368827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.313784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Adeno-associated virus","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeno-associated_virus"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Short story","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
