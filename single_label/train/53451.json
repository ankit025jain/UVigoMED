{"id":53451,"title":"[Effect of banxia xiexin decoction on gastric antral interstitial cells of Cajal and stem cell factor in diabetic rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Banxia Xiexin Decoction (BXD) on expression of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and stem cell factor (SCF) in the antrum of rats with diabetes mellitus (DM).Totally sixty healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into the control group, the model group, the BXD group, and the Western medicine group (WM, treated by domperidone), 15 in each group. Diabetic rat models were established by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg). Those in the BXD group were perfused with BXD at the daily dose of 5.4 g/kg. An equal volume of distilled water was given by gastrogavage to those in the WM group and the control group for 8 successive weeks. The body weight and blood glucose of all rats were detected, and the gastric residual rates were detected with semisolid nutrient paste by gastrogavage. The expression of positive ICCs and SCF were observed by immunohistochemical method and quantified image analyzer.Compared with the control group,the body weight reduced, blood glucose and gastric residual rates increased, and the mean optical density of positive ICCs and SCF significantly decreased in the model group (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group,symptoms such as polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria were relieved, spirits improved, the body weight and mean optical densities of positive ICCs and SCF significantly increased (P < 0.05), and gastric residual rates significantly decreased in the BXD group and the WM group (P < 0.05). The blood glucose significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the BXD group. The mean optical density of positive ICCs was higher in the BXD group than in the WM group (P < 0.05).BXD could promote the expression of positive ICCs and SCF. It could improve the gastric motility in DM rats by partially inverting abnormal changes of gastric antral ICCs and SCF.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Endocrine System
