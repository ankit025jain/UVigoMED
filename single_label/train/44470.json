{"id":44470,"title":"Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: recent advances in China.","abstract":"Orthotopic liver transplantation is currently the best treatment option for selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). From 1980 to 2011, 8874 patients with HCC in China underwent liver transplantation. The organ donation classification criteria of China (China criteria), which are established by the Government of China, are divided into three parts: China criteria I, donation after brain death; China criteria II, donation after cardiac death and China criteria III, donation after dual brain-cardiac death. Data from the China Liver Transplant Registry(CLTR) System shows that patients within the Milan criteria have higher survival rates than those who are beyond these criteria. Based on CLTR data, altogether 416 patients received living-donor liver transplantation(LDLT) in China. Their 1-year and 3-year survival rates were significantly higher than those of the non-LDLT recipients. The most common early stage(<30 days after liver transplantation) complications include pleural effusion, diabetes, peritoneal effusion or abscess, postoperative infection, hypertension and intraperitoneal hemorrhage; while the most common late stage (? 30 days after liver transplantation) complications were diabetes, hypertension, biliary complications,postoperative infection, tacrolimus toxicity and chronic graft rejection. The incidence of vascular complication, which is the main reason for acute graft failure and re-transplantation, was 2.4%. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with HCC in China.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734307","annotations":[{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Brain death","weight":0.855339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.747621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.72295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.659469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.371969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.257496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.229701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Milan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Non-heart-beating donation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-heart-beating_donation"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
