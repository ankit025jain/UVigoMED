{"id":61830,"title":"Emerging new anticancer biological therapies in 2013 (haematological malignancies).","abstract":"Although some haematologic diseases such as Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive lymphoma yield high response rates and acceptable overall survival in first-line treatment, relapse is still a challenge particularly in those patients not eligible for transplant. In acute leukaemias, the prognosis remains poor in general with standard chemotherapy, thus stressing the need for efficient alternate therapies.In recent years, biological anticancer agents comprising mAbs, small targeted molecules or more recently bispecific T-cell engaging molecules or chimeric antigen receptors have been developed in haematologic diseases. This review examines the recent advances in biotherapies in the fields of acute leukaemias, aggressive lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia.Most biological anticancer agents are currently developed in the setting of relapsed or refractory disease. Some of them however are under development or are already used in first-line therapy wherein they have improved the prognosis of haematology patients.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24663027","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.762792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
