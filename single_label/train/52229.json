{"id":52229,"title":"Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to an ABCC8 mutation: a case report.","abstract":"Neonatal diabetes is a rare disorder with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 live births. It is defined as diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months of life and it is vital to differentiate this entity from type 1 diabetes to enable accurate diagnosis, prognosis, genetic counseling and treatment.We describe a case of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to a novel mutation affecting the ABCC8 gene that encodes the SUR1 subunit of potassium ATP channel (KATP).This genetic diagnosis has therapeutic implications as patients can switch from insulin therapy to sulphonylurea, as described in this case report.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618446","annotations":[{"name":"Sulfonylurea","weight":0.87695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.844803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.831328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.692943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.67656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.662804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.344499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"ABCC8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC8"},{"name":"Neonatal diabetes mellitus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"}]}
