{"id":80235,"title":"Spatial distribution of malaria in Peninsular Malaysia from 2000 to 2009.","abstract":"Malaria is still an endemic disease of public health importance in Malaysia. Populations at risk of contracting malaria includes indigenous people, traditional villagers, mobile ethnic groups and land scheme settlers, immigrants from malaria endemic countries as well as jungle workers and loggers. The predominant species are Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. An increasing number of P. knowlesi infections have also been encountered. The principal vectors in Peninsular Malaysia are Anopheles maculatus and An. cracens. This study aims to determine the changes in spatial distribution of malaria in Peninsular Malaysia from year 2000-2009.Data for the study was collected from Ministry of Health, Malaysia and was analysed using Geographic Information System (GIS).Changes for a period of 10 years of malaria spatial distribution in 12 states of Peninsular Malaysia were documented and discussed. This is illustrated by digital mapping according to five variables; incidence rate (IR), fatality rate (FR), annual blood examination rate (ABER), annual parasite index (API) and slide positivity rate (SPR).There is a profound change in the spatial distribution of malaria within a 10-year period. This is evident from the digital mapping of the infection in Peninsular Malaysia.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735583","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.898537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.731221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.630639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.571091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.548353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.547579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.520556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.405407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.376714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Geographic information system","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.26445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Plasmodium knowlesi","weight":0.150635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_knowlesi"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.134465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Logging","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging"},{"name":"Peninsular Malaysia","weight":0.130079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_Malaysia"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Jungle","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Settler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
