{"id":20298,"title":"Rv1027c-Rv1028c encode functional KdpDE two--component system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abstract":"In Mycobacteriumtuberculosis Rv1027c-Rv1028c genes are predicted to encode KdpDE two component system, which is highly conserved across all bacterial species. Here, we show that the system is functionally active and KdpD sensor kinase undergoes autophosphorylation and transfers phosphoryl group to KdpE, response regulator protein. We identified His(642) and Asp(52) as conserved phosphorylation sites in KdpD and KdpE respectively and by SPR analysis confirmed the physical interaction between them. KdpD was purified with prebound divalent ions and their importance in phosphorylation was established using protein refolding and ion chelation approaches. Genetically a single transcript encoded both KdpD and KdpE proteins. Overall, we report that M. tuberculosis KdpDE system operates like a canonical two component system.
