{"id":87857,"title":"[Investigate progress on risk factors and risk assessment of osteoporotic fractures].","abstract":"Osteoporotic fracture is the most destructive ending of osteoporosis, many interacting risk factors play a role in its occurrence. With age, the bodies function decline gradually. Symptoms like soreness of the waist, back pain, cramp of the lower limb and weakness appears. These are related to TCM syndrome factors like kidney deficiency, liver deficiency, spleen deficiency and blood stagnation. Symptoms can act as a warning of the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture in the early stages. The risk assessment tool of osteoporotic fracture is mostly developed on the basis of modern risk factors and thus lacks syndrome differentiation, that may limit its utilization. If the relevant content of syndrome differentiation is integrated into the forecasting tool and a risk assessment tool of osteoporotic fracture which complies with the demographics of China is built up, population risk assessment for high of risk could be established and scientific evidence for the adoption of effective interventions could be applied.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974436","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.867584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.789375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.719035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"China","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.467298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.420999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cramp","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.359272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.338497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.337213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.23575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.133789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.0351018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Spleen (Chinese medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen_(Chinese_medicine)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0242565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Forecasting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Investigate (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigate_(magazine)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Kidney (Chinese medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_(Chinese_medicine)"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
