{"id":37360,"title":"Beyond Framingham risk factors and coronary calcification: does aortic valve calcification improve risk prediction? The Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study.","abstract":"Aortic valve calcification (AVC) is considered a manifestation of atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated whether AVC adds to cardiovascular risk prediction beyond Framingham risk factors and coronary artery calcification (CAC).A total of 3944 subjects from the population based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study (59.3±7.7?years; 53% females) were evaluated for coronary events, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (including all plus CV death) over 9.1±1.9?years. CT scans were performed to quantify AVC. Cox proportional hazards regressions and Harrell's C were used to examine AVC as event predictor in addition to risk factors and CAC.During follow-up, 138 (3.5%) subjects experienced coronary events, 101 (2.6%) had a stroke, and 257 (6.5%) experienced CVD events. In subjects with AVC>0 versus AVC=0 the incidence of coronary events was 8.0% versus 3.0% (p<0.001) and the incidence of CVD events was 13.0% versus 5.7% (p<0.001). The frequency of events increased significantly with increasing AVC scores (p<0.001). After adjustment for Framingham risk factors, high AVC scores (3rd tertile) remained independently associated with coronary events (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.81) and CVD events (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.58). After further adjustment for CAC score, HRs were attenuated (coronary events 1.55, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.69; CVD events 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.00). When adding AVC to the model containing traditional risk factors and CAC, Harrell's C indices did not increase for coronary events (from 0.744 to 0.744) or CVD events (from 0.759 to 0.759).AVC is associated with incident coronary and CVD events independent of Framingham risk factors. However, AVC fails to improve cardiovascular event prediction over Framingham risk factors and CAC.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501258","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.869711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.793617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.76674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.703829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Harrells, North Carolina","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrells,_North_Carolina"},{"name":"Framingham, Massachusetts","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Heinz Nixdorf","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Nixdorf"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"H.
