{"id":50574,"title":"Maspin expression in endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, and its relation with angiogenesis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the maspin expression in endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and also to investigate its relation with angiogenesis.A total of 19 women with complex atypical hyperplasia, 44 patients with simple hyperplasia without atypia, and 67 patients with endometrial carcinoma were included. Maspin expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and tested for possible significant relation with age, FIGO stage, histologic type, grade, depth of myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI), lymph node metastasis, and overall survival (OS). Angiogenesis was determined by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining.Maspin expression was detected in only three patients with endometrial hyperplasia (5%). In patients with endometrial cancer, cytoplasmic and nuclear maspin expressions were detected in 36 (53.7%) and 18 (26.9%) patients, respectively. No significant relation was noted between staining localizations and prognostic variables. The five-year OS rate for patients with cytoplasmic staining was 91%, compared to 87% for patients without staining (p = 0.31). These values for nuclear expression were 100% and 87%, respectively (p = 0.16). The cytoplasmic and nuclear maspin expressions were found to be significantly correlated with VEGF (r = 0.278, p = 0.02 and r = 0.295, p = 0.01, respectively).This is the first study to demonstrate the relation between maspin expression and angiogenesis in endometrial cancer. Although no survival difference was noted for cytoplasmic or nuclear maspin expressions, a tendency was detected for nuclear staining. Further series will clarify the exact prognostic role of maspin expression in gynecological malignancies including endometrial cancer.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772914","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Endometrial hyperplasia","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.715553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Myometrium","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myometrium"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.689674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.472218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.216595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
