{"id":77644,"title":"Prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among the brick field workers of West Bengal, India.","abstract":"Brick field industry is one of the most important and oldest industries in India, where millions of workers suffered from work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). The main aim of the present investigation was to assess the prevalence of WMSDs among brick field workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 216 brick field workers. A modified Nordic questionnaire was applied among them. In brick making industry, the workers adopt different unfavorable actions, such as frequent bending; bending and twisting of the body; and working above shoulder height, which may lead to severe pain in different parts of the body, especially lower back (brick carriers: 90%; moulders: 92%; fireman: 75%; stackers: 88%) and neck (brick carriers: 89%; moulders: 88%; fireman: 54%; stackers: 72%), It was concluded from the study that health of the brick field workers was highly affected due to working in different awkward postures for long periods.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499251","annotations":[{"name":"India","weight":0.603167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"West Bengal","weight":0.430089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal"},{"name":"Bengal","weight":0.227267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Brick","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Nordic countries","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Firefighter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"},{"name":"Parapet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapet"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Stacker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacker"},{"name":"Lineman (occupation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(occupation)"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"}]}
