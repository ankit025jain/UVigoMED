{"id":76959,"title":"Prospective associations of vitamin D status with ?-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glycemia: the impact of parathyroid hormone status.","abstract":"Previous studies have yielded conflicting findings on the relationship between low vitamin D (25-OH-D) and impaired glucose homeostasis. In this context, we hypothesized that combined assessment of 25-OH-D with its regulator parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be required for optimal evaluation of the impact of vitamin D status on glucose metabolism. Thus, we evaluated the prospective associations of 25-OH-D and PTH at 3 months postpartum with ?-cell function (Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 [ISSI-2]), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), and glycemia at 12 months postpartum in 494 women undergoing serial metabolic characterization. Notably, 32% of those with prediabetes/diabetes mellitus at 12 months postpartum had both vitamin D deficiency and PTH in the highest tertile at 3 months postpartum. On multiple-adjusted linear regression analyses, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency with PTH in the highest tertile at 3 months independently predicted poorer ?-cell function (P = 0.03) and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.01) and increased fasting (P = 0.03) and 2-h glucose (P = 0.002) at 12 months postpartum. In contrast, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency with lower PTH did not predict these outcomes. In conclusion, only vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency with increased PTH is an independent predictor of ?-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and glycemia, highlighting the need for consideration of the PTH/25-OH-D axis when studying the impact of vitamin D status on glucose homeostasis.
