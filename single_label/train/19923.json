{"id":19923,"title":"Declining rate of infection with maternal human immunodeficiency virus at delivery units in north-central Nigeria.","abstract":"HIV testing during labour and delivery provides a critical opportunity for administering appropriate interventions to prevent mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT). We studied current HIV rates and infection trend among women tested during delivery following scale-up of PMTCT and antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in Jos, north central Nigeria. Between March 2010 and January 2012, provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling was offered in early labour. Women were recruited from a government tertiary health centre, a faith-based hospital, and a private health centre. Those who previously tested HIV negative during antenatal care (ANC) and those who presented at the labour ward with unknown HIV status were tested. A total of 944 subjects (727 re-tested for HIV infection and 217 with unknown HIV status) were enrolled and tested during labour. The HIV incidence and sero-conversion rates during pregnancy among women who repeated HIV testing at delivery was 1.7 per 100 person-years of observation (pyo) and 0.6% (4/727), respectively, while the rate among those who tested for the first time in labour was 1.8% (4/217). Women who accessed ANC were older and had achieved a higher educational status than those who did not access ANC. A 3- to 5-fold decline in HIV incidence and prevalence rates was detected among women tested at delivery when compared to data from a report in 2004. It is not certain whether the decline in maternal HIV infection is due to the major state-wide scale-up of PMTCT and HIV treatment programs. A broader and purposefully designed evaluation study would be required to verify observed occurrence.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689325","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.725454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.59286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.406245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.21856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.143593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"African National Congress","weight":0.120727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Ward (country subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Boeing 727","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_727"},{"name":"2010 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup"}]}
