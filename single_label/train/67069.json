{"id":67069,"title":"Correlation of patient perception of pad use with objective degree of incontinence measured by pad test in men with post-prostatectomy incontinence: the SUFU Pad Test Study.","abstract":"Many investigators have used the number of pads to determine the severity of post-prostatectomy incontinence and yet the accuracy of this tool remains unproven. We determined whether the patient perception of pad use and urine loss reflects actual urine loss. We also identified a quality of life measure that distinguishes patients by severity of incontinence.We prospectively enrolled 235 men from a total of 18 sites 6 months or more after radical prostatectomy who had incontinence requiring protection. Patients completed a questionnaire on the perception of pad number, size and wetness, a quality of life question, several standardized incontinence questionnaires and a 24-hour pad test that assessed pad number, size and weight. SPSS® was used for statistical analysis.Perception of the number of pads used closely agreed with the number of pads collected during a 24-hour pad test. Perceived and actual pad size had excellent concordance (76%, p <0.001). Patients with wet and soaked pads had statistically and clinically significantly different pad weights that were uniquely different from each other and from those of patients who were almost dry and slightly wet. Response to the quality of life question separated the men into 4 statistically significantly different groups based on mean 24-hour pad weight.Patients accurately described the number, size and degree of wetness of pads collected during a 24-hour pad test. These values correlated well with actual urine loss. The single question, \"To what extent does urine loss affect your quality of life?\" separated men into distinct categories.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650425","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.14466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.0624174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"SUFU","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUFU"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Paw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Wetting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
