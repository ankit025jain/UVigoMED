{"id":53027,"title":"Epigenetic silencing of the LDOC1 tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"Due to very unspecific symptoms ovarian cancer often is diagnosed only at a late stage of the disease. Thus, morbidity and mortality of the patients are high. Even the established tumor marker CA12-5 shows only low specificity, rising the need for alternative biomarkers capable of detecting early stages of ovarian cancer. We analyzed the expression of the tumor suppressor candidate gene LDOC1 (leucine zipper downregulated in cancer 1) as a potential early biomarker in ovarian cancer cell lines.A total of seven ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and real-time PCR for expression of LDOC1. Verification of promoter methylation was performed using methylation-specific primers on bisulfite-modified genomic DNA.Three out of seven ovarian cancer cell lines showed a complete loss of LDOC1 gene expression. LDOC1 silencing was caused neither by gene deletion nor gene rearrangements, but by methylation and subsequent inactivation of the concerned promoter as proofed by methylation specific primers. Similarly, promoter methylation could be inhibited by adding AdC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases. As a result, a reactivation of the LDOC1 gene was seen.The tumor suppressor gene LDOC1 in ovarian cancer cell lines is downregulated by promoter methylation and thus may serve as an early biomarker. Further investigation will show if detection of methylated LDOC1 in peripheral blood has both adequate sensitivity and specificity for a timely non-invasive detection of ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24554348","annotations":[{"name":"Leucine
