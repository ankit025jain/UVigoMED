{"id":88715,"title":"Injury-related emergency department visits by children and adolescents: United States, 2009-2010.","abstract":"Key findings Data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2009-2010 In 2009-2010, an annual average of 11.9 million injury-related emergency department (ED) visits were made by children and adolescents aged 18 years and under in the United States. The injury-related ED visit rate was 151 per 1,000 persons aged 18 years and under, and rates were higher for males than for females for all age groups (0-4 years, 5-12 years, and 13-18 years). The injury-related ED visit rates among persons aged 5-12 years and 13-18 years were higher for non-Hispanic black persons than for other race and ethnicity groups. Leading causes of injury-related ED visits among both males and females included falls and striking against or being struck unintentionally by objects or persons. Visit rates were higher for males than for females for both of these causes. Injury is the leading cause of death and a major source of morbidity among children and adolescents in the United States (1,2). The emergency department (ED) plays an important role in the care of injuries, and these visits often represent the initial contact with a provider for the injury (3). This report examines nationally representative data on injury-related ED visits by children and adolescents aged 18 years and under in the United States during 2009-2010. Injury-related ED visit rates were also compared for the age groups 0-4, 5-12, and 13-18 years, as these correspond to the preschool, school-age, and teen life periods respectively.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802002","annotations":[{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.638079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.586183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.563854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.363382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.217544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Strike action","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1318","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1318"},{"name":"Key (company)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(company)"},{"name":"Major (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"}]}
