{"id":90789,"title":"Pins and rubber band traction for treatment of comminuted intra-articular fractures in the hand.","abstract":"To determine the efficacy of pins and rubber band traction for treatment of comminuted intra-articular fractures in the hand.We performed a retrospective study from 1994 to 2013 to evaluate 33 patients in whom pins and rubber band traction was employed. We clinically evaluated the active range of motion of the affected fingers after surgery. Eleven of the 33 fractures were at the proximal interphalangeal joint, 10 at the distal interphalangeal joint, 5 at the thumb interphalangeal joint, and 2 at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb. The remaining 5 patients had complex fracture-dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joints.The mean follow-up period was 24 months. The average active motion of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers was 91° (range, extension 0°-10°/flexion 85°-90°), proximal interphalangeal joints was 92° (range, extension/flexion 0°-10°/85°-100°), and distal interphalangeal joints was 73° (range, extension/flexion 0°-10°/60°-80°). The overall average of all active motion of the injured fingers except thumbs was 255° (range, 240°-270°). The average active motion of the of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint was 56° (range, extension 5°-10°/flexion 50°-55°), and interphalangeal joint was 74° (range, extension 0°-10°/flexion 75°-80°). The average of active motion of the injured thumb metacarpal and interphalangeal joints combined was 130° (range, 125°-135°).Pins and rubber band traction is a treatment option for comminuted displaced intra-articular fractures of the digits that offers satisfactory clinical results.Therapeutic IV.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576751","annotations":[{"name":"Interphalangeal articulations of hand","weight":0.898451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand"},{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.849447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.82913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.801815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.740291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.716845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Thumb","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb"},{"name":"Digit (anatomy)","weight":0.492287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.253016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rubber band","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_band"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Trochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Natural rubber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
