{"id":67976,"title":"Acute renal dysfunction: time from coronary angiography to cardiac surgery.","abstract":"The incidence of acute renal dysfunction has not changed much over the years, despite improvements in perioperative care. Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of timing of cardiac surgery after coronary angiography on acute renal dysfunction, to identify risk factors associated with development of acute renal dysfunction, and to measure the association between acute renal dysfunction and mortality.The patients were divided into 3 groups: group A (cardiac surgery 0-3 days after angiography), group B (surgery 4-6 days after angiography), and group C (surgery?>?6 days after angiography). Endpoints were acute renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine?>?25% of baseline on the 3rd postoperative day, and mortality.In 749 patients, the incidence of acute renal dysfunction was 15%; 5% required dialysis. Hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ejection fraction?<?40%, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, intraaortic balloon pump use, and urgent surgery were risk factors for acute renal dysfunction after cardiac surgery. Patients in group C had a lower risk of acute renal dysfunction.Acute renal dysfunction has a definite relationship with the time period between angiography and cardiac surgery. The causative factors for this condition are multiple and also show a consistent association with mortality.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569321","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.392913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.216904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
