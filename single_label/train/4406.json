{"id":4406,"title":"Immunology of experimental and natural human hookworm infection.","abstract":"Human hookworm infection is one amongst the most prevalent of the neglected tropical diseases. An informative experimental animal model, that is, one that parallels a human infection, is not available for the study of human hookworm infection. Much of our current understanding of the human immune response during hookworm infection relies on the studies from experimental infection of hookworm-na√Øve individuals or the natural infections from individuals residing in hookworm-endemic areas. The experimental human infections tend to be acute, dose-controlled infections, often with a low larval inoculum so that they are well tolerated by human volunteers. Natural hookworm infections usually occur in areas where hookworm transmission is constant and infection is chronic. In cases where there has been drug administration in an endemic area, re-infection often occurs quickly even amongst those who were treated. Hence, although many of the characteristics of experimental and natural hookworm infection differ, both models have elements in common: mainly an intense Th2 response with the production of total and specific IgE as well as elevated levels of eosinophilia, IL-5, IL-10 and TNF. While hookworm infection affects millions of individuals worldwide, much of the human immunology of this infection still needs to be studied and understood.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25337625","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.917265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.806778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.523221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.367894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neglected diseases","weight":0.155599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_diseases"},{"name":"Tropical disease","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
