{"id":29750,"title":"Anthocyanin-rich açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) extract attenuates manganese-induced oxidative stress in rat primary astrocyte cultures.","abstract":"Manganese (Mn) is an essential element for human health. However, at high concentrations Mn may be neurotoxic. Mn accumulates in astrocytes, affecting their redox status. In view of the high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the exotic Brazilian fruit açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), its methanolic extract was obtained by solid-phase extraction (SPE). This açaí extract showed considerable anthocyanins content and direct antioxidant capacity. The açaí extract scavenged 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH•) with an EC?? of 19.1 ppm, showing higher antioxidant activity compared to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), but lower than ascorbic acid and quercetin. This obtained açaí extract also attenuated Mn-induced oxidative stress in primary cultured astrocytes. Specifically, the açaí extract at an optimal and nutritionally relevant concentration of 0.1 ?g/ml prevented Mn-induced oxidative stress by (1) restoring GSH/GSSG ratio and net glutamate uptake, (2) protecting astrocytic membranes from lipid peroxidation, and (3) decreasing Mn-induced expression of erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) protein. A larger quantity of açaí extract exacerbated the effects of Mn on these parameters except with respect to lipid peroxidation assessed by means of F?-isoprostanes. These studies indicate that at nutritionally relevant concentration, anthocyanins obtained from açaí protect astrocytes against Mn neurotoxicity, but at high concentrations, the \"pro-oxidant\" effects of its constituents likely prevail. Future studies may be profitably directed at potential protective effects of açaí anthocyanins in nutraceutical formulations.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617543","annotations":[{"name":"Ascorbic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"},{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Nutraceutical","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutraceutical"},{"name":"Astrocyte","weight":0.883579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"},{"name":"Butylated hydroxytoluene","weight":0.878913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylated_hydroxytoluene"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.803577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Pro-oxidant","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-oxidant"},{"name":"Anthocyanin","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.419099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.406672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.403713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.365734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.201595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"DPPH","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPPH"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Introduced species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species"}]}
