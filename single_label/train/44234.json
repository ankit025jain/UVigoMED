{"id":44234,"title":"Baseline factors predictive of patient satisfaction with sacral neuromodulation for idiopathic fecal incontinence.","abstract":"Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is an established treatment for fecal incontinence (FI). A recent study from our group found that the relationship between patient satisfaction and clinical outcome is complex and does not match the traditional used success criteria. Therefore, the ability to predict patient satisfaction must be given priority. The aim of the present study is to identify baseline factors predictive of patient satisfaction, with SNM, for idiopathic FI.We analyzed data from patients treated with SNM for idiopathic FI in Aarhus, Denmark, and Maastricht, The Netherlands. A questionnaire considering self-reported satisfaction was mailed to these patients and compared to baseline characteristics. Logistic regression was used to determine the predictive value of baseline demographic and diagnostic variables.In total, 131 patients were included in the analysis. Patient satisfaction with the current treatment result was reported in 75 patients. Fifty-six patients were dissatisfied with SNM treatment, after median 46 months (range 11-122) with permanent implantation. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) was the solely identified predictor for long-term patient satisfaction. A subgroup univariate-logistic regression analysis showed that PNTML ? 2.3 ms at the side of lead implantation was a statistically significant predictor for patient satisfaction (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-5.24, p = 0.048).Baseline PNTML measurement may be predictive of long-term satisfaction with SNM therapy for idiopathic FI. Further studies are needed to confirm this result.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System
