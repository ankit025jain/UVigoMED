{"id":33114,"title":"[A clinical case of diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction myocardium in a patient with infectious myocarditis].","abstract":"The paper describes a rare clinical case involving primary cardiomyopathy (noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium (NCLVM), infectious myocarditis, and, possibly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Objective, laboratory instrumental, invasive examination (coronarography with right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy) of the patient and histological study of his heart biopsy revealed acute infectious myocarditis concurrent with NCLVM and, possibly, HCM. The detection of a rare abnormality as NCLVM necessitates a meticulous additional examination to identify other primary cardiomyopathies (including HCM).","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864472","annotations":[{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.829982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.419691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","weight":0.361689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
