{"id":61443,"title":"Advances in supportive care for multiple myeloma.","abstract":"As patients with multiple myeloma live longer, helping them live better through improvements in supportive care is equally as vital. Intrinsic to the disease are bone-related complications at presentation and over the course of illness. Bisphosphonates have been an important therapy for ameliorating the risk of skeletal-related events, and work is ongoing to determine their optimal schedule. Patients with multiple myeloma also encounter several challenges related to their treatment, including peripheral neuropathy, thrombotic complications, and infections. These challenges are being addressed through a better understanding of the risk factors for developing these complications and by mitigating these risks through better dosing schemas and prophylaxis.
