{"id":41179,"title":"A novel intramuscular bivalent norovirus virus-like particle vaccine candidate--reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity in a phase 1 trial in healthy adults.","abstract":"Noroviruses are the most important viral causes of gastroenteritis-related morbidity and mortality. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated an adjuvanted bivalent intramuscular norovirus virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine.Forty-eight adults aged 18-49 years received either 2 doses containing genotype GI.1 VLP and a consensus GII.4 VLP or 2 doses of placebo. Doses (5 µg, 15 µg, 50 µg, or 150 µg of each VLP) were administered 4 weeks apart in the first stage. Subsequently, 54 adults, aged 18-49 (n=16), 50-64 (n=19), and 65-85 (n=19) years, received 2 doses of vaccine containing 50 µg of each VLP. Total and class-specific antibody responses, as well as histoblood group antigen (HBGA) blocking antibody responses, were measured before and after each dose.Local reactions were mainly injection site pain/tenderness, with no reported fever or vaccine-related serious adverse events. One dose of vaccine containing 50 µg of each VLP increased GI.1 geometric mean titers (GMTs) by 118-fold, 83-fold, and 24-fold and increased GII.4 GMTs by 49-fold, 25-fold, and 9-fold in subjects aged 18-49, 50-64, and 65-83 years, respectively. Serum antibody responses peaked at day 7 after the first dose, with no evidence of boosting following a second dose. Most subjects achieved HBGA-blocking antibody titers of ?200.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951828","annotations":[{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.720775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.615439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.560645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.433706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Blocking antibody","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_antibody"},{"name":"Virus-like particle","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus-like_particle"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1849","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1849"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Boosting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Divalent","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divalent"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Human-based genetic algorithm","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_genetic_algorithm"}]}
