{"id":16030,"title":"Screening of antibacterial effects of anise essential oil alone and in combination with conventional antibiotics against Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates.","abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the effects of anise essential oil alone and in combination with conventional antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin) against Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODs: Anise essential oil (AEO) was isolated by hydrodistillation from dried powdered fruits. Its chemical composition was investigated by GC-MS and GC-FID. Broth dilution assay was used to evaluate the antibacterial effects of anise essential oil. The interactions with antibiotics were studied by the checkerboard assay.Trans-anethole (90.18%) was identified as major constituent in anise essential oil. Almost all combinations AEO-amoxicillin and AEO-ciprofloxacin showed indifferent interactions (1 < FIC index < or = 2). Positive interactions (addition and weak synergism) were found only for four combinations AEO-amoxicillin (FIC index = 1,0.62, 0.75 and 0.5) and one combination AEO-ciprofloxacin (FIC index = 0.62).Herbal products containing anise essential oil may be used as expectorants in combination with amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin in Streptococcus pneumoniae infections without diminishing antibiotic efficacy.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076728","annotations":[{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.937542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.728216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.679235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mucolytic agent","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucolytic_agent"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Anise","weight":0.373713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anise"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.286088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Empirical formula","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_formula"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Appearance Event Ordination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Event_Ordination"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Drying (food)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_(food)"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Imperial College London","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London"},{"name":"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Checkerboard","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard"}]}
