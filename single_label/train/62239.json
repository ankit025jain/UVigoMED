{"id":62239,"title":"Homoharringtonine combined with cytarabine to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis and its impact on bone marrow CD34+CD7+ cells.","abstract":"The therapeutic response of chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis (CML-MBC) is very poor.To explore the therapeutic effect of homoharringtonine (HHT) combined with cytarabine (HA regimen) on CML-MBC and its influence on bone marrow CD34+CD7+ cells.Thirty-four patients with CML-MBC were treated with the HA regimen and bone marrow CD34+CD7+ cells were assayed prior to and after treatment. Among 33 evaluable patients, the overall hematological response (complete/ partial hematological response and hematological improvement) was 60.1%. Seven patients (21.2%) had a cytogenetic response 12 months after treatment. In the untreated CMLMBC patients, the proportion of bone marrow CD34+CD7+ cells was much higher than in the control group (19.4 ± 7.9 vs. 4.4 ± 1.5%, p < 0.05) and decreased to 14.1 ± 7.1% (p < 0.05) after treatment. Before treatment, the proportion of CD34+CD7+ cells was lower in the patients who had a hematological response to the HA regimen than in the patients who did not respond.The HA regimen is an effective treatment for CML-MBC and CD34+CD7+ cells may be one of the valuable clinical parameters to assess treatment effectiveness.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603361","annotations":[{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Omacetaxine mepesuccinate","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omacetaxine_mepesuccinate"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"CD7","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD7"},{"name":"Engrish","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engrish"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_hemorrhagic_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"}]}
