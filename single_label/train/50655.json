{"id":50655,"title":"Hypothyroidism: causes, killers, and life-saving treatments.","abstract":"Hypothyroidism is a very common, yet often overlooked disease. It can have a myriad of signs and symptoms, and is often nonspecific. Identification requires analysis of thyroid hormones circulating in the bloodstream, and treatment is simply replacement with exogenous hormone, usually levothyroxine (Synthroid). The deadly manifestation of hypothyroidism is myxedema coma. Similarly nonspecific and underrecognized, treatment with exogenous hormone is necessary to decrease the high mortality rate.
