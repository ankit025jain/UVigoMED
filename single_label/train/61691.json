{"id":61691,"title":"The heavy chain diseases: clinical and pathologic features.","abstract":"Heavy chain diseases are a family of rare, systemic syndromes typically associated with or representing a variant of a B-cell neoplasm. Their characteristic feature is production of a mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain incapable of either partnering with light chains in the formation of a full immunoglobulin molecule or of being degraded by the proteasome. The abnormal heavy chain is detected in urine and/or serum without an associated light chain, a pathognomonic finding. Depending on the subtype of the altered heavy chain, these conditions can be subclassified as alpha, gamma, or mu heavy chain disease. We discuss the clinical presentation; epidemiology; laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic features; and treatment options for each of the heavy chain diseases, emphasising the importance of an accurate pathologic diagnosis and correct interpretation of immunologic studies in their identification.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683718","annotations":[{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pathognomonic","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.78456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin heavy chain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain"},{"name":"Heavy chain disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_chain_disease"},{"name":"Heavy chain","weight":0.0289305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_chain"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.0228099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
