{"id":86465,"title":"Rapid screening for influenza using a multivariable logistic regression model to save labor at a clinic in Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan.","abstract":"To lighten the workload of health care professionals, we conducted a clinical test of a newly developed automated infection screening system using a multivariable logistic regression model. The system was tested with 44 influenza patients and 45 healthy control subjects based on 3 vital signs: facial temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate. The system showed a high accuracy for distinguishing influenza patients from control subjects within 15 seconds.
