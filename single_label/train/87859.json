{"id":87859,"title":"[Half circle external fixation for the treatment of open tibial fibular fractures].","abstract":"To explore the effect of half circle external fixation for the treatment of open tibial fractures.From March 2005 to March 2011, 94 patients with open tibiofibula fractures were treated by closed manipulative or Kirschner-wire poking reduction with half circle groove external fixation including 63 males and 31 females with an average age of 39 years old ranging from 17 to 65 years old. Among these patients, 5 cases were cross shaped fractures, 19 were oblique form and spiral fractures, 70 cases were comminuted fractures. According to the fracture Gustilo classification, 49 cases were type IIIA, 45 were type IIIB. The incidence of wound infection, fracture healing time were observed. The function was evaluated according to the Johner-Wruhs standard.All patients were followed up for 14 to 63 months (averaged 29 months). The wound healing time was from 16 to 39 weeks (means 21.4 weeks). No fracture nonunion, osteomyelitis and calf compartment syndrome occurred. The wounds of 81 cases were healed at the first period,deep wound infection occurred in 2 cases. According to the function Johner-Wruhs evaluation criteria:the result was excellent in 52 cases, good in 37 cases, fair in 5 cases.Closed manipulative or Kirschner-wire poking reduction and half circle groove external fixation can reduce the infection rate of open tibiofibula fractures. For open tibiofibula comminuted fractures, after the half circle groove external fixation for 3 to 6 weeks, a middle Kirschner-wire was removed according to fracture end healing situation to make fixation dynamic and promote fracture healing.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974434","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.779242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.612287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.429635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.388132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Compartment syndrome","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.346901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.152786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.134583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0288827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Spiral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral"},{"name":"Oblique case","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_case"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Group 3 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_3_element"},{"name":"Groove (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Triceps surae muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_surae_muscle"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Psychological manipulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
