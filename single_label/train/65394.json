{"id":65394,"title":"[Effects of miR-145 on the migration and invasion of prostate cancer PC3 cells by targeting DAB2].","abstract":"It was reported that miR-145, which is significantly decreased in a variety of tumor cells, is associated with cell proliferation and metastasis. In this study, using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro assays, we identified DAB2 (Disabled homolog 2) as a downstream target gene of miR-145 during tumor metastasis process. DAB2 has been characterized as an important tumor suppressor, and is usually expressed at low levels in tumor cells. However, in this study, the relative high-level expression of DAB2 gene was observed in the highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells. Moreover, enforced expression of miR-145 could significantly down-regulate the expression level of DAB2 in PC3 cells, and inhibit the migration and invasion of PC3 cells. Notably, dysfunction of PC3 cells induced by miR-145 overexpression can be rescued by co-overexpression of DAB2. These results demonstrate that miR-145 regulates the migration and invasion of highly invasive prostate cancer cells through targeting DAB2 gene.
