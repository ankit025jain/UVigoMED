{"id":79425,"title":"[The morphological study of the Perfoost demineralized bone alloimplant applied for the plastic reconstruction of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to enhance the effectiveness of the surgical treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) by means of the application of the Perfoost demineralized bone alloimplant for the plastic reconstruction of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal. This aim was attained by the elucidation of morphological features the Perfoost alloimpalnt at the site of surgical intervention one year after the operation. The study included 12 patients presenting with CSOM (epi- and epimesotympanitis) who had underwent \"closed-type\" sanation surgery of the middle ear. A Perfoost demineralized bone implant (DBI) plate was used for plastic reconstruction of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal. The secondary intervention within one year after the implantation was used to obtain 5Ã—5 mm biopsy specimens containing a fragment of Perfoost DBI together with the adjacent cicatrical tissue bordering the \"living\" bone. The biopsies were subjected to standard histological treatment. It was shown that the fragment of the transplanted bone tissue underwent resorption accompanied by neo-osteogenesis. The source of formation of the new bone was fibroblastic elements of connective tissue of the recipient undergoing transformation into osteoblasts under the influence of resorbable components of the alloimplant. The presence of pre-existing bone canals and perforation holes in the implant provides the favourable conditions for its invasion by connective tissue that ensures its strong immobilization and gradual replacement by the newly formed bone tissue which corresponds by \"carcass\" regeneration. The results of the present study give evidence of the high clinical effectiveness of reconstructive surgery for the treatment of CSOM with the application of the Perfoost demineralized bone alloimplant used for the plastic correction of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal.
