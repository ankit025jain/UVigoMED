{"id":65816,"title":"Anti-carcinogenic potential of Euphorbia neriifolia leaves and isolated flavonoid against N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced renal carcinogenesis in mice.","abstract":"Anti-carcinogenic potential of hydro-ethanolic extract of Euphorbia neriifolia (EN) leaves and an isolated flavonoid (ENF) was investigated against N-Nitrosodiethylamine (DENA)-induced renal carcinogenesis in mice. Experimental mice were pretreated with 150 and 400 mg/kg body wt of EN, 0.5% and 1% mg/kg body wt of butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) as a standard antioxidant and 50 mg/kg body wt of ENF for 21 days prior to the administration of a single dose of 50 mg/kg body wt of DENA. Levels of renal markers (urea and creatinine), xenobiotic metabolic enzymes (Cyt P450 and Cyt b5), lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GST and GSH) and other biochemical parameters--AST, ALT, ALP, total protein (TP), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured to determine the renal carcinogenesis caused by DENA. DENA administration significantly (p < 0.001) decreased the body weight and increased the tissue weight. It significantly (p < 0.001) enhanced the levels of Cyt P450, Cyt b5 and LPO and decreased the levels of SOD, CAT, GST and GSH content. The activities of AST, ALT and ALP and the TP content and renal markers were also significantly decreased (p < 0.001), while TC level was markedly increased after DENA administration, as compared with the normal control group (p < 0.001). Pretreatment with EN and ENF counteracted DENA-induced oxidative stress (LPO) and exerted its protective effects by restoring the levels of antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GST and GSH), biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, ALP, TP and TC), renal markers (urea and creatinine) and xenobiotic enzymes (Cyt P450 and Cyt b5) in renal tissue. In conclusion, the present study showed significant anti-carcinogenic potential of the hydro-ethanolic extract of E. neriifolia and ENF against DENA-induced renal carcinogenicity.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772977","annotations":[{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Xenobiotic","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.731686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.619471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.54149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.489217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.336834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.296841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.220177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Butylated hydroxyanisole","weight":0.153788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylated_hydroxyanisole"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0662312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Endangered species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
