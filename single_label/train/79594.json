{"id":79594,"title":"A Fasciola hepatica-derived fatty acid binding protein induces protection against schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma bovis using the adjuvant adaptation (ADAD) vaccination system.","abstract":"Several efforts have been made to identify anti-schistosomiasis vaccine candidates and new vaccination systems. The fatty acid binding protein (FAPB) has been shown to induce a high level of protection in trematode infection. The adjuvant adaptation (ADAD) vaccination system was used in this study, including recombinant FABP, a natural immunomodulator and saponins. Mice immunised with the ADAD system were able to up-regulate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) and induce high IgG2a levels. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in worm burden, egg liver and hepatic lesion in vaccinated mice in two independent experiments involving Schistosoma bovis infected mice. The foregoing data shows that ADAD system using FABP provide a good alternative for triggering an effective immune response against animal schistosomiasis.
