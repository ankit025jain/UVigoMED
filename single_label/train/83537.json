{"id":83537,"title":"[The preliminary study of structure variation related to keloid based on the whole-gene resequencing technique].","abstract":"To investigate the genome structure variation (SV) related with keloid using the whole-gene resequencing technology.We studied a keloid pedigree containing 4 generation of 27 people. 5 people (4 cases of keloid patients, and 1 case of normal) were selected to extract the genomic DNA. Then the whole-gene resequencing technique was used to check the variations.Through database comparison and variation annotation analysis, we obtained 2 SVs associated with keloid formation. We used DAVID software to do the gene ontology and pathway analysis. We found a 168 bp inversion in gene tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) in all keloid patients, which contained the forth exon of TSPAN8.There was no report about SVs related to keloid. In this study, we found 2 SVs associated with keloid, especially TSPAN8. The tumor cells express the TSPAN8 can up-regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors, promote the adjacent fibroblasts secrete matrix metalloproteinases and uridylyl phosphate adenosine. So we hypothesis that the inversion of the forth exon in TSPAN8 may lead to the signal transduction disorder in the keloid patients. This study was a preliminary research. It needs a further study containing large sample to confirm.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322576","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.744624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.709307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.675954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.643986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.386854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.223263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Annotation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Pedigree chart","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"},{"name":"Ontology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology"},{"name":"Gene Ontology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ontology"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Chromosomal inversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_inversion"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"}]}
