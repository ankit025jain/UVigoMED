{"id":5830,"title":"[Ideas and methods of two-dimensional zebrafish model combined with chromatographic techniques in high-throughput screening of active anti-osteoporosis components of traditional Chinese medicines].","abstract":"To break through the restrictions of the evaluation model and the quantity of compounds by using the two-dimensional zebrafish model combined with chromatographic techniques, and establish a new method for the high-throughput screening of active anti-osteoporosis components.According to the research group-related studies and relevant foreign literatures, on the basis of the fact that the zebrafish osteoporosis model could efficiently evaluate the activity, the zebrafish metabolism model could efficiently enrich metabolites and the chromatographic techniques could efficiently separate and analyze components of traditional Chinese medicines, we proposed that the inherent combination of the three methods is expected to efficiently decode in vivo and in vitro efficacious anti-osteoporosis materials of traditional Chinese medicines.The method makes it simple and efficient in the enrichment, separation and analysis on components of traditional Chinese medicines, particularly micro-components and metabolites and the screening anti-osteoporosis activity, fully reflects that efficacious materials of traditional Chinese medicines contain original components and metabolites, with characteristic of \"multi-components, multi-targets and integral effect\", which provides new ideas and methods for the early and rapid discovery of active anti-osteoporosis components of traditional Chinese medicines.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095395","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.430722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.430676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.381013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.359916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.328827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"China","weight":0.327794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Zebrafish","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Theory of Forms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
