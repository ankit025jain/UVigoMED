{"id":42377,"title":"Gastroenteritis outbreaks caused by a DS-1-like G1P[8] rotavirus strain, Japan, 2012-2013.","abstract":"Rotavirus A (RVA) genotype G1P[8], a hallmark of the Wa-like strain, typically contains only genotype 1 genes. However, an unusual RVA G1P[8] with genotype 2 genes was recently detected in Japan. We determined the complete genomic constellation of this RVA. Our findings suggest that mixed RVAs may be more competitive than once thought.
