{"id":28016,"title":"[The structure of psychopathology associated with addictive disorders, against alcohol addiction and the possibility of its neurometabolic correction of the elderly].","abstract":"The article considers the actual problem in modern medicine, the study of psychiatric symptoms associated with addictive disorders on the background of alcohol abuse in the elderly. It is shown that neurotic pathology in elderly patients with alcohol dependence is characterized by the presence of six major symptoms, reflecting the excitation processes, overcoming compensation, deficit symptoms, irritation and stabilization of the pathological state. It is proved that Cytoflavin, maintaining a certain level of excitement in the cerebral cortex, provides the optimal voltage of compensatory mechanisms in older people in overcoming their psychiatric symptoms, connected with addictive disorders.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051777","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Neurosis","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.558923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.312195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.28412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Psychomotor agitation","weight":0.142418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0653277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Voltage","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
