{"id":14013,"title":"[Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenoblockers, and their combinations on survival and plasma catecholamine levels in rats with chronic heart failure with induced exacerbations].","abstract":"By using model of chronic heart failure (CHF) occurring with induced decompensations, it was shown that inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and beta-adrenoblockers promoted to different degree the correction of hypercatecholaminemia and an increase of survival of rats. The most pronounced effect was characteristic of beta-adrenoblockers atenolol, propranolol, and carvedilol. The lower activity was demonstrated by other adrenoblockers that had no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as well as captopril. However, positive effect of these drugs on rat survival occurred regardless of their action on the sympathoadrenal system. The ACE inhibitors, particularly hydrophilic lysinopril, to the lesser degree than beta-adrenoblockers, prevented death of animals at the period of the CHF decompensation. The combined use of ACE inhibitors with beta-adrenoblockers, especially with carvedilol, promoted the maximally expressed decrease of the sympathoadrenal activity and an increase of the rat survival, including that at the CHF decompensation.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450223","annotations":[{"name":"Captopril","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captopril"},{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Propranolol","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol"},{"name":"Atenolol","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenolol"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Sympathomimetic drug","weight":0.844425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Carvedilol","weight":0.814023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvedilol"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.80997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Hydrophile","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"},{"name":"ACE inhibitor","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor"},{"name":"Beta blocker","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.321041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.237453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme","weight":0.134235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme"}]}
