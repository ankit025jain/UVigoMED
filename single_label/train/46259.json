{"id":46259,"title":"[Inflammatory bowel disease: an overview].","abstract":"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the most common chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and endoscopic findings completed by histopathology. The therapeutic options range from topical antiinflammatory therapies to classical immunosuppression and biological agents, i. e. anti-TNF-antibodies. This manuscript gives an overview on the state of the art in diagnostics and therapy ofboth, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic algorithms are based on the statements of the German consensus conferences.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640117","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.7471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.674708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.2144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Academic conference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
