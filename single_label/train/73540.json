{"id":73540,"title":"Plastic induction of CD133AC133-positive cells in the microenvironment of glioblastoma spheroids.","abstract":"Recent studies showed that the stemness of cancer stem cells is maintained under a hypoxic microenvironment. However, the relationship of the hypoxic microenvironment in a three-dimensional cell mass and the induction of cancer stem cell-like phenotype is not well known. We examined the relationship between CD133 expression and the hypoxic microenvironment using glioblastoma spheroids formed with the T98G cell line. CD133(AC133)- and HIF-1?-positive cells were observed in the marginal region of the central hypoxic area positive for HIF-1? 10 days after plating T98G cells. CD133(AC133)-positive cells were positive for nestin. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the CD133 expression level is not different in spheroids during the tested period after spheroid formation, indicating that post-translational regulation of the CD133 protein mediates positivity to CD133(AC133). When spheroids were trypsinized and the dissociated cells were cultured under the adherent monolayer conditions, the CD133(AC133)-positive cells gradually disappeared. These results show that CD133(AC133)-positive cells, which may incline toward undifferentiated cells because of nestin positivity, are plastically induced under the different culture conditions, spheroid and monolayer. In this plasticity, HIF-1? is involved in the induction and maintenance of CD133(AC133)-positive cells. Spheroids as an in vitro tumor model are useful to study the dynamic changes in the tumor cell phenotype in the different cell microenvironments.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897999","annotations":[{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.755792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.716897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.587905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.554481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.353709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.209971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Posttranslational modification","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"G cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_cell"},{"name":"Spheroid","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Plasticity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Dissociation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Monolayer","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolayer"}]}
