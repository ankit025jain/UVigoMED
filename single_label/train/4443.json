{"id":4443,"title":"[Microsymbiocenosis of Codiella mollusks as a basis for symbiotic relations in the parasite-host system in opisthorchiasis].","abstract":"The purpose of the first step of microparasitocenosis investigation was to study the microbiocenosis of the first intermediate hosts of O. felineus--prosobranch gastropods of the genus Codiella, as well as their habitats. Materials were collected in the Iryum River of the Ob-Irtysh basin. The microflora of mollusks, water, and soil from their habitats was examined. The predominant flora was Aeromonas species in the biocenosis of mollusks and Enterobacteriaceae in the microbiocenosis of the water basin and soil. Examination of the microbial communities in the mollusks and their habitats showed that the range of microbial populations of mollusks was wider in species composition as compared to the microbiocenosis of soil and water.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286543","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.804907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Symbiosis","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Mollusca","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca"},{"name":"Biocoenosis","weight":0.622723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocoenosis"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.50729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gastropoda","weight":0.487302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropoda"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Species richness","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_richness"},{"name":"Aeromonas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas"},{"name":"Opisthorchis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthorchis"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material"},{"name":"Microbial population biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_population_biology"}]}
