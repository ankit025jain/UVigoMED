{"id":81857,"title":"Why is dental treatment of the gravid patient regarded with caution? When is the appropriate time for care--be it emergent or routine--in the gravid patient?","abstract":"There are myths surrounding pregnancy and the oral cavity, such as, \"having a baby causes your gums to swell and your teeth to weaken,\" or \"I don't need to see a dentist, there's nothing wrong with my teeth\" or \"with each child say bye to a tooth or two.\" All these myths are just that, myths. During pregnancy, women may experience pregnancy gingivitis or may suffer from pre-existing periodontal disease. The myth of tooth loss during pregnancy, according to the ADA (American Dental Association), has \"no histological, chemical or radiographic evidence to support [it]\". The biggest myth or misconception is that dental care is unnecessary during pregnancy, and until problems arise, some gravid women draw back from seeking dental treatment. Also, professionals sometimes shy away from care of the gravid patient for reasons associated with teratogenicity and fetotoxicity. Teratogenic effects take place from three to eight weeks after conception, and fetotoxicity can occur at the latter end of the initial trimester on to delivery, according to Donaldson and Goodchild, authors of Pregnancy, breast-feeding and drugs used in dentistry in JADA's (The Journal of the American Dental Association) August, 2012 issue. This article includes reasons dental treatment is regarded with caution; therefore, appropriate timing of dental care and suggested clinical recommendations as they relate to the pregnant patient are reviewed.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812724","annotations":[{"name":"Teratology","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.74799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.737596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"American Dental Association","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dental_Association"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.437965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.265635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.237679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.231439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mythology","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Journal of the American Dental Association","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Dental_Association"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
