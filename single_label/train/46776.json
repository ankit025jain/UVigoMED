{"id":46776,"title":"HBV DNA and HBsAg levels as risk predictors of early and late recurrence after curative resection of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that high hepatitis B virus (HBV) load is associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The aim of our study was to investigate the predictive role of HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels in early and late recurrence of HCC after curative resection in patients with HBV-related HCC.From January 2008 to December 2010, a total of 248 patients underwent curative resection for HBV-related early-stage HCC (solitary tumor; < 5 cm in diameter or multinodular tumor; number of tumors ? 3 and diameter < 3 cm). We analyzed the predictive factors including HBV DNA and HBsAg levels for early recurrence (within 2 years) and late recurrence (after 2 years) of HCC after curative resection.The median follow-up duration was 33.3 months. Cumulative recurrence rates after resection at 1, 3, and 5 years were 16.6, 34.0, and 46.7 %, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for early recurrence were the presence of microvascular invasion (hazard ratio [HR] 3.86; p < 0.001), preoperative HBV DNA levels ? 20,000 IU/mL (HR 2.77; p < 0.001), and des-?-carboxy prothrombin level ? 40 mAU/mL (HR 1.76; p = 0.045). Although, the risk factors for late recurrence by multivariate analysis were preoperative HBsAg levels ? 4,000 IU/mL (HR 2.80; p = 0.023) and age at resection ? 50 years (HR 3.22; p = 0.032).The HBV DNA levels were associated with early recurrence, whereas HBsAg levels were associated with late recurrence after curative resection in HBV-related HCC.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619495","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.779913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.583857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.541879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.532101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.432321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.13054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Charlotte Bobcats","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"}]}
