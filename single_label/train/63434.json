{"id":63434,"title":"Primary anorectal Hodgkin lymphoma: report of a case and review of the literature.","abstract":"Primary colorectal lymphomas are very rare. They are mostly B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Only 2 cases of anorectal Hodgkin lymphoma have been described so far, both affecting HIV-infected males and showing Epstein-Barr virus infection. We report an unusual case of primary Hodgkin lymphoma of the anorectal region in an HIV-negative, Epstein-Barr virus-infected patient and in the absence of inflammatory bowel disease. The importance of distinguishing Hodgkin lymphoma from Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disorders and from Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the elderly is stressed in particular in non-immunocompromised patients and in the absence of history of inflammatory bowel disease.
