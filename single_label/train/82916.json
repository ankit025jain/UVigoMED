{"id":82916,"title":"Inter-relation of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cytokines in oral cancer patients and their clinical significance.","abstract":"Altered cytokine production can lead to immune dysfunction in cancer patients. Hence, we investigated the cytokine balance in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and their significance in providing new therapeutic insights.We quantified Th17 (IL17A), Treg (TGF?1), Th1 (IL2, IFN?) and Th2 (IL4, IL10) like cytokines in the sera of 78 cases and 39 controls by ELISA. The intracellular expression of these cytokines was analyzed in 10 subjects from each group by flow cytometry.Serum levels of IL17A, TGF?1, IL4 and IL10 were significantly higher while IL2 and IFN? were relatively lower in patients as compared to controls. TGF?1 (r=0.55), IL4 (r=0.75) and IL10 (r=0.80) significantly (P<0.0001) correlated with disease progression and their elevated levels showed increased odd ratios of approximately 18, 14 and 37, respectively. IL17A appeared as a risk factor (OR=2.21, 95% CI=0.89-5.42) although statistically insignificant. The levels neither correlated with disease progression nor with TGF?1, IL4 and IL10 but showed positive association with IL2 (r=0.51, P<0.0001) and IFN? (r=0.24). Flow cytometry data also showed similar trend.We reported a distinct TGF?1 and Th2 (IL4, IL10) polarization with a borderline elevation of IL17A while, a suppression of Th1 (IL2, IFN?) cytokines in OSCC patients.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486578","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.857895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.826613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.758148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.705767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.606098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.266035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.167501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"}]}
