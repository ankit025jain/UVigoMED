{"id":66799,"title":"Decreased expression of Dkk1 and Dkk3 in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"The expression patterns of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family of proteins varies in different cancers. In the present study, the expression levels of Dkk1 and Dkk3 were investigated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues. Dkk1 and Dkk3 serum levels were also examined in patients with ccRCC, and the association between clinicopathological features and Dkk levels was investigated. Serum Dkk1 and Dkk3 were quantified using ELISA in 64 patients with ccRCC and in 30 healthy individuals (controls). The expression levels of Dkk1 and Dkk3 were analyzed in tumor and adjacent normal tissues obtained from patients with ccRCC (n=20) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The mean serum levels of Dkk1 and Dkk3 in the patients with ccRCC were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls. Furthermore, the serum Dkk1 levels were significantly lower at higher tumor?node?metastasis stages and tumor grades. qPCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed a significant decrease in the Dkk1 and Dkk3 mRNA and protein levels in the tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Consequently, Dkk1 and Dkk3 may present a novel molecular target for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of ccRCC.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676838","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.624413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.265412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Protein family","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
