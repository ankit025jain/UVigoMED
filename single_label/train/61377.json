{"id":61377,"title":"[Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma].","abstract":"Hodgkin lymphoma became to be a curative disease. The standard treatment has been established for Hodgkin lymphoma, but its optimization still is explored. Risk stratification is critical in terms of optimization. The favorable patients would be treated with less toxic regimens. PET results are now used to evaluate the treatment response, and recently interim PET has been shown as a good predictor of prognosis. Interim PET is now incorporated into the treatment strategy of Hodgkin lymphoma in clinical trials. Molecular targeting drugs have been developed. Brentuximab vedotin, a kind of antibody drug conjugate, showed favorable clinical results for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724416","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.837674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.83479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.654746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.586928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.323346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.262852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.201538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Brentuximab vedotin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
