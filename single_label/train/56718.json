{"id":56718,"title":"[A case of allergic contact dermatitis due to unit dose type purified sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic solution].","abstract":"We report a patient who developed allergic contact dermatitis after using a purified sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic solution (Hyalein Mini) recognized as being extremely safe.A 67-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of poor visual acuity. She had dry eye, cataract and ptosis in both eyes, and underwent crystalline lens reconstruction and ptosis surgery in both eyes. Postoperatively, her dry eye showed exacerbation and she developed Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Keratoconjunctival epithelial disorders were controllable with lacrimal punctum plugs, Hyalein Mini and 0.1% fluorometholone ophthalmic suspension. The patient, however, repeatedly developed blepharitis, and allergic contact dermatitis was diagnosed with a positive patch test to epsilon-aminocaproic acid, an excipient in Hyalein Mini. Since switching to an ophthalmic solution without epsilon-aminocaproic acid, the allergic contact dermatitis has not recurred.When the same ophthalmic solution is used for chronic disease for a long time, it should be noted that allergic contact dermatitis may develop.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640792","annotations":[{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Ptosis (eyelid)","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Blepharitis","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blepharitis"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.79765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.671355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.542891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.495399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lacrimal punctum","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_punctum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.171955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Excipient","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Chief complaint","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_complaint"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"}]}
