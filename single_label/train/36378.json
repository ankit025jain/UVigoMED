{"id":36378,"title":"Defective maintenance of pH of stratum corneum is correlated with preferential emergence and exacerbation of atopic-dermatitis-like dermatitis in flaky-tail mice.","abstract":"Neutralization of stratum corneum (SC) pH, which is induced by a variety of stimuli, such as scratching, use of soap and inflammation, can stimulate activity of serine protease (SPase). Activation of SPase induces production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) through protease-activated receptor-2. Both reduced expression of natural moisturizing factors, which are required for maintenance of SC pH, and the preferential development of atopic dermatitis (AD)-like dermatitis are found in flaky-tail mice (FTM) with a loss-of-function mutation in filaggrin.We examined possible correlations between disturbance of responses to an exogenous stimulus of SC neutralization and the preferential emergence of AD-like dermatitis in FTM.FTM and wild-type mice (C57BL/6) were subjected to an SC-neutralization stimulus via application of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (TMG). TMG was applied to young mice at a time when FTM had not yet developed significant dermatitis, and we examined their ability to maintain SC acidity and several parameters associated with AD-like dermatitis.The recovery of SC pH after the application of TMG was delayed in FTM, presumably because of unchanged expression of Na(+)/H(+) antiporter 1, which is involved in maintenance of SC acidity. Cutaneous inflammation with elevated SPase activity and serum levels of TSLP, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and IgE were induced only in TMG-treated FTM.Our results suggest that defective maintenance of pH of SC is correlated with emergence and exacerbation of AD-like dermatitis in FTM.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581509","annotations":[{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.84784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Serine protease","weight":0.808201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine_protease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.785959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.718403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Stratum corneum","weight":0.65318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.561117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.502037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.228267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Filaggrin","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filaggrin"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Soap","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap"},{"name":"Antiporter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiporter"},{"name":"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymic_stromal_lymphopoietin"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
