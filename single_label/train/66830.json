{"id":66830,"title":"[Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma: follow-up of a series of 23 patients].","abstract":"To describe survival data and prognostic factors in a population of renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid renal carcinoma.We reviewed the files of 950 patients treated for malignant renal tumor in two centers between January 2002 and December 2011. Patients with sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma were extracted. Demographic data, treatments, histopathological and survival data as well as prognostic factors were analyzed.Twenty-three patients (2.4%) with 65% of men were included with a mean age of 62.8 years (41; 82). Median ECOG PS was 1 (0; 3) and median Karnofsky PS was 80% (40-100). Median tumor size was 100mm (30; 190). Eight patients (35%) were metastatic at diagnosis. An initial surgical treatment was performed in 22 patients (95.7%). Tumors were clear cell carcinoma in 19 cases (82.6%). TNM tumor stage was greater than 2 in 81.8% of cases. Median rate of sarcomatoid component was 50% (10; 100). In univariate analysis, the existence of initial metastasis and microvascular invasion were predictors of specific survival. In multivariable analysis, the only predictor was the initial existence of metastasis. A progression was observed in metastatic mode in 78% of patients within a median of 7 months. The median disease-specific survival was 18 months.Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas were aggressive tumors with a median progression-free survival of 7 months and a median disease-specific survival of 18 months. Prognostic factors were comparable to high-risk renal cell carcinomas.5.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674336","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.41342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cooperative_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
