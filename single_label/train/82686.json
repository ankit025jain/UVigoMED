{"id":82686,"title":"Use of lincomycin-impregnated demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft in the periodontal defect after third molar surgery.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the periodontal regenerative capacity of demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) alone or used with local lincomycin.In the present single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial, 20 subjects 26 years old or older, requiring extraction of bilateral third molars (M3s), were included. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive either DFDBA or DFDBA plus lincomycin therapy. Within the subjects, 1 M3 site was randomly selected to be the experimental site and the contralateral served as the control and was permitted to heal without intervention. The primary variables were changes in the probing depth (PD), clinical alveolar bone levels (ABLs), and radiographic alveolar bone density (ABD) on the distal aspect of second molar between baseline (immediately postoperatively) and 26 weeks postoperatively (T26). Appropriate sample sizes and descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were computed.For both treatment and control sites, between T0 and T26, statistically significant improvements were seen in the ABLs and ABD (P < .05). Within-subject comparisons showed no significant differences in PD, ABL, or ABD between the treatment and control M3 sites at T0 or T26 (P > .05). Also, no significant differences were found in the PD, ABL, or ABD between the 2 treatment M3 sites at T26 (P > .05).The results of the present study have revealed that the PD, ABL, and ABD improved after M3 removal in subjects 26 years old or older, irrespective of the treatment or control group. Reconstructive procedures (e.g., DFDBA with or without lincomycin therapy) did not offer predictable benefits compared with a no-treatment protocol in patients younger than 30 years old.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560173","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.733774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.643183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.586821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.450646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.402592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.385991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.340019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.284813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0540804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Lincomycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincomycin"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wisdom tooth","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Kolmogorov space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_space"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"GER Class T26","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GER_Class_T26"}]}
