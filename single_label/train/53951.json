{"id":53951,"title":"Gender-dependent associations of CDKN2A/2B, KCNJ11, POLI, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2 variants with type 2 diabetes in (North African) Tunisian Arabs.","abstract":"We investigated the impact of gender on T2DM association with confirmed susceptibility loci. CDKN2A/2B rs10811661, KCNJ11 rs5219, and TCF7L2 rs7903146 were associated with T2DM in females, while POLI rs488846 was associated with T2DM among males; the association of SLC30A8 rs13266634 and TCF7L2 rs4506565, rs12243326, and rs12255372 with T2DM was gender-independent.
