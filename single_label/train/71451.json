{"id":71451,"title":"Principles of musculoskeletal biopsy.","abstract":"The appropriate treatment of any musculoskeletal tumor is based on a correct diagnosis. In some instances, a patient's history and imaging studies provide sufficient information to guide definitive treatment. However, in many cases, a biopsy may be necessary. A biopsy, although technically simple, must be conducted in a thoughtful manner in order to obtain an accurate tissue sample while avoiding complications. Some potential complications include inaccurate sampling, improperly placed incision that complicates future surgeries, and healthy tissue contamination that can add morbidity to the definitive surgery or preclude the chance of limb salvage. This chapter will review the considerations for planning and performing a biopsy of musculoskeletal tumors.
