{"id":39941,"title":"Literature-based analysis on relationship of symptoms, drugs and therapies in treatment of intestinal diseases.","abstract":"To evaluate clinical articles published in the past 30 years using the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory of the lung being connected with large intestine to treat intestinal diseases. We also analyzed the relationship between symptoms, drugs and therapies with data-excavating technology to aid management.After retrieving relevant clinical articles, we set up a database, used Microsoft Structured Query Language Server 2005 Analysis Services as a data-excavating tool, and applied the association rule to study the relationship between the symptoms, drugs and therapies of intestinal diseases.The key symptoms of dyschesia, constipation, abdominal fullness, fatigue and pale tongue could be treated with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis) to invigorate Qi and moisten the intestine. Among these agents, Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) was used most frequently. Clearing Fu-organs was the most prevalent therapy for abdominal fullness, dyschesia, constipation and red tongue. Clearing Fu-organs could be achieved with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) and Gua-lou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), whereas Qi could be invigorated using Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Baizhu (Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae) and Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum). Moistening the intestine was possible with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huomaren (Fructus Cannabis) and Jiegeng (Radix Platycodi). Also, moistening the lungs was done with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), ventilating the lungs with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), and nourishing the lungs with Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) and Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum). These data demonstrated that Kuxingren (Semen ArmeniacaeAmarum) was a key agent.Our analyses of the literature showed clear relationships between symptoms (constipation, dyschesia, abdominal fullness), drugs [Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici)] and therapies (moistening the intestine, clearing Fu-organs, invigorating Qi, ventilating the lungs).","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102700","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.737533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"China","weight":0.496625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.473576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.431792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.416459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.414618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microsoft","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.291924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.253385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.229985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.182246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.178566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"SQL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0193761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Deforestation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Server (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.0111494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"}]}
