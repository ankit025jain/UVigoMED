{"id":2828,"title":"[Visual function assessment in children after surgical management of congenital eyelid ptosis using the silicone rod].","abstract":"To analyse the early and late postoperative visual function in children undergoing surgery for congenital eyelid ptosis with the use of silicone rod.Congenital eyelid ptosis was diagnosed in 14 children aged 3-18 years. Analyzing the patients we focused on visual function parameters in early and late postoperative period. The follow up period ranged from 6 months to 1 year after the surgery.The visual outcome analysis in patients with congenital eyelid ptosis shows good functional and cosmetic results. The visual function improved gradually depending on patient age and severity of ptosis.Functional and aesthetic outcomes of the procedure performed using the silicone rod were good. The technique contributed to the shortened duration of postoperative visual rehabilitation period.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345286","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.406281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Ptosis (eyelid)","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.145536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Rod cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
