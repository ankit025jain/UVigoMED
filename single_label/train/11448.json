{"id":11448,"title":"Evidence supporting the match/mismatch hypothesis of psychiatric disorders.","abstract":"Chronic stress is one of the predominant environmental risk factors for a number of psychiatric disorders, particularly for major depression. Different hypotheses have been formulated to address the interaction between early and adult chronic stress in psychiatric disease vulnerability. The match/mismatch hypothesis of psychiatric disease states that the early life environment shapes coping strategies in a manner that enables individuals to optimally face similar environments later in life. We tested this hypothesis in female Balb/c mice that underwent either stress or enrichment early in life and were in adulthood further subdivided in single or group housed, in order to provide aversive or positive adult environments, respectively. We studied the effects of the environmental manipulation on anxiety-like, depressive-like and sociability behaviors and gene expression profiles. We show that continuous exposure to adverse environments (matched condition) is not necessarily resulting in an opposite phenotype compared to a continuous supportive environment (matched condition). Rather, animals with mismatched environmental conditions behaved differently from animals with matched environments on anxious, social and depressive like phenotypes. These results further support the match/mismatch hypothesis and illustrate how mild or moderate aversive conditions during development can shape an individual to be optimally adapted to similar conditions later in life.
