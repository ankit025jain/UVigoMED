{"id":44858,"title":"From ischochymia to gastroparesis: proposed mechanisms and preferred management of dyspepsia over the centuries.","abstract":"Dyspeptic symptoms are common with most patients suffering functional disorders that remain a therapeutic challenge for medical practitioners. Within the last three decades, gastric infection, altered motility, and hypersensitivity have gained and lost traction in explaining the development of functional dyspepsia. Considering these shifts, the aim of this review was to analyze changing understanding of and approaches to dyspepsia over a longer time period. Monographs, textbooks, and articles published during the last three centuries show that our understanding of normal gastric function has improved dramatically. With increased insight came new ideas about disease mechanisms, diagnostic options, and treatments. Despite shifts over time, the importance of functional abnormalities was recognized early on and explained in the context of societal influences and stressors, anxieties, and biological influences, thus resembling the contemporary biopsychosocial model of illness. Symptoms were often attributed to changes in secretion, motility, and sensation or perception with technological innovation often influencing proposed mechanisms and treatments. Many of the principles or even agents applied more than a century ago are still part of today's approach. This includes acid suppression, antiemetics, analgesics, and even non-pharmacologic therapies, such as gastric decompression or electrical stimulation of the stomach. This historical information does not only help us understand how we arrived at our current state of knowledge and standards of care, it also demonstrates that enthusiastic adoption of various competing explanatory models and the resulting treatments often did not survive the test of time. In view of the benign prognosis of dyspepsia, the data may function as a call for caution to avoid the potential harm of overly aggressive approaches or treatments with a high likelihood of adverse effects.
