{"id":11028,"title":"[The relationship between hypoxia-inducible factor-1? expression and apoptosis in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage].","abstract":"To investigate the association of hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) expression and apoptosis in the cerebral cortex following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by modified monofilament puncture method in rats. Thirty-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: sham-operated group, SAH 6 h, SAH 12 h, SAH 24 h and SAH 72 h groups. HIF-1? expression was assessed by immunofluorescence staining. TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) technique was adopted to detect apoptotic cells. Double immunolabeling was used to identify cell types with positive HIF-1? expression.The expression of HIF-1? was increased at 6 h (4.65%±1.01%), peaked at 24 h (18.55%±4.23%), and decreased at 72 h (6.31%±1.15%) after SAH (P<0.05). TUNEL-positive cells were up-regulated in the brain at 6 h (7.09%±2.34%), peaked at 24 h (25.54%±7.36%), and down-regulated at 72 h (14.11%±3.03%) after SAH (P<0.05). A significant positive correlation was noted between HIF-1? positive rates and TUNEL positive rates following SAH (r=0.738, P<0.05). Double immunolabeling indicated that HIF-1? was expressed predominantly in neurons and some nuclei with positive HIF-1? were co-stained with TUNEL.The data indicate that HIF-1? might participate in the pathological progression of early brain injury after SAH.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616462","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","weight":0.729698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.615544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.436833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.418655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.382101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"}]}
