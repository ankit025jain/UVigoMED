{"id":24308,"title":"Massive consolidation: a rare manifestation of paediatric Scrub typhus.","abstract":"Despite resurgence in the number of Scrub typhus cases, it still poses a diagnostic challenge as there is no prototype presentation. We report a case of a child with Scrub typhus who developed a massive consolidation. Despite such an extensive consolidation, respiratory symptoms such as cough and breathlessness were inconspicuous thereby posing a diagnostic dilemma. Upon serological confirmation, doxycycline therapy was initiated with a rapid and complete resolution of the pneumonia, both clinically and radiologically. The case is being reported to highlight this unusual presentation of Scrub typhus in children.
