{"id":13722,"title":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 protects synaptic and learning functions from neuroinflammation in rodents.","abstract":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is derived from the processing of proglucagon in intestinal L-cells and releases insulin from pancreatic ?-cells as an incretin. The GLP-1 receptor has been proposed as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, in which neuroinflammation is critical in the pathogenesis. The present study investigates whether GLP-1 (7-36) amide, an active fragment of GLP-1, protected against synaptic impairments induced by inflammation-related injurious agents (lipopolysaccharide [LPS], interleukin-1? [IL-1?], and H2 O2). In the Y-maze test, LPS (10 ?g/mouse, i.c.v) significantly decreased the percentage alternation. Pretreatment with GLP-1 (7-36) amide (0.09-0.9 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.) prevented an impairment in spontaneous alternation performance. Pretreatment with LPS (10 ?g/ml, 2 hr) impaired LTP induction but not paired-pulse facilitation in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. This impairment was prevented by cotreatment with GLP-1 (7-36) amide (50 nM). IL-1? (0.57 nM) or H2 O2 (50 ?M) also impaired LTP induction. This impairment was prevented by GLP-1 (7-36) amide (50 nM). These results suggest that GLP-1 (7-36) amide improves the synaptic impairments induced by inflammation-related injurious agents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464856","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.875478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Amide","weight":0.741659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.594102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.444384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Long-term potentiation","weight":0.174042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Incretin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incretin"},{"name":"Proglucagon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglucagon"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"736","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/736"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Hippocampus anatomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus_anatomy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"}]}
