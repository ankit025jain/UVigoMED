{"id":18904,"title":"Evaluation of correlations between underlying disease and port complications.","abstract":"Evaluation of correlations between underlying disease and port complications.Retrospective analysis of a data set of 3160 port systems, which had been interventionally implanted over a period of 10 years. Of these, 1393 were included in the final evaluation. The 7 most common underlying diseases and port-induced complications were considered. Port-related thrombotic events, port pocket infections as well as the port-induced sepsis were evaluated and classified as either early or late complications.In 1393 ports, 131 experienced complications. Of these, 22.1 % (n?= 29) were early and 79.6 % (n = 102) late complications. The overall incidence rate of late complications was 0.253/1000 observed days. It differed significantly between the underlying diseases (p < 0.001) and was significantly lower in colon carcinoma when compared with pancreatic (p = 0.049), gastric (p =?0.012) and bronchial carcinoma (p = 0.042). The incidence rate of the port sepsis between the underlying diseases also differed significantly (p = ?0.006) and had the highest rate in gastric and bronchial carcinoma. The occurrence of a thrombotic event also showed a significant difference in the incidence rates between the underlying diseases (p?=?0.045) and was highest in pancreatic and gastric carcinoma.There are significant differences in the incidences of complications between the underlying diseases. Knowledge about this can help to improve the port-care and to take specific preventive measures.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756387","annotations":[{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.767016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.43407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.351629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"1393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1393"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
