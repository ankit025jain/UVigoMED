{"id":42547,"title":"TGF-? signaling pathway as a pharmacological target in liver diseases.","abstract":"Transforming growth factor ? (TGF-?) belongs to a class of pleiotropic cytokines that are involved in the processes of embryonic development, wound healing, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Moreover, TGF-? is also regarded as a central regulator in the pathogenesis and development of various liver diseases because it contributes to almost all of the stages of disease progression. A range of liver cells are considered to secrete TGF-? ligands and express related receptors and, consequently, play a crucial role in the progression of liver disease via different signal pathways. In this manuscript, we review the role of the TGF-? signaling pathway in liver disease and the potential of targeting the TGF-? signaling in the pharmacological treatment of liver diseases.
