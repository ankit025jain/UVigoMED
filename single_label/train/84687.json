{"id":84687,"title":"Effect of electroacupuncture versus prucalopride for severe chronic constipation: protocol of a multi-centre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"Acupuncture is safe and may be effective for severe chronic constipation. The World Gastroenterology Organisation recommends prucalopride for patients for whom previous laxative use failed to provide satisfactory relief.In this prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial, five hundred sixty patients with severe chronic constipation (two or less spontaneous complete bowel movements per week) from 14 centres will be randomised to receive either electroacupuncture or prucalopride. Participants in the electroacupuncture group will receive electroacupuncture for eight weeks, while participants in the control group will take prucalopride (2 mg once daily) for 32 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients having ? 3 spontaneous, complete bowel movements per week, averaged over week three to eight. The secondary outcome measures include eight items, including the proportion of patients having ? 3 spontaneous, complete bowel movements per week averaged over week 9-32, the proportion of patients with one or more increases in spontaneous, complete bowel movements per week from baseline, mean Bristol Stool Scale, etc. Statistical analysis will include the CMH test, nonparametric tests and t tests.We aimed to compare the effect of electroacupuncture versus prucalopride for severe chronic constipation. The limitation of this study is that participants and acupuncturists will not be blinded.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055821","annotations":[{"name":"Laxative","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.641821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.50925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.44491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.26132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Bristol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol"},{"name":"Bristol Stool Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Stool_Scale"},{"name":"World Gastroenterology Organisation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Gastroenterology_Organisation"},{"name":"Prucalopride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prucalopride"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"932","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/932"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"World","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World"},{"name":"List of New York City Ballet 2010 Fall repertory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_Ballet_2010_Fall_repertory"}]}
