{"id":50964,"title":"The diabetes gene Hhex maintains ?-cell differentiation and islet function.","abstract":"The homeodomain transcription factor HHEX (hematopoietically expressed homeobox) has been repeatedly linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using genome-wide association studies. We report here that within the adult endocrine pancreas, Hhex is selectively expressed in the somatostatin-secreting ? cell. Using two mouse models with Hhex deficiency in the endocrine pancreas, we show that Hhex is required for ?-cell differentiation. Decreased somatostatin levels in Hhex-deficient islets cause disrupted paracrine inhibition of insulin release from ? cells. These findings identify Hhex as the first transcriptional regulator specifically required for islet ? cells and suggest compromised paracrine control as a contributor to T2DM.
