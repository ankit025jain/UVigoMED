{"id":66768,"title":"Seminal hyperviscosity is not associated with semenogelin degradation or sperm deoxyribonucleic acid damage: a prospective study of infertile couples.","abstract":"To investigate the association between seminal hyperviscosity, the extent of semenogelin degradation, and sperm DNA integrity (DNA fragmentation index [DFI] and high DNA stainability [HDS]) in semen from infertile couples.Prospective study.University-affiliated fertility center.Twenty-four consecutive infertile couples with moderate or high seminal viscosity (hyperviscosity group) and 25 consecutive infertile couples with normal semen viscosity (control group) undergoing standard IVF.Semen volume and seminal hyperviscosity, sperm concentration, motility, and morphology, level of semenogelin degradation (by immunoblotting), and sperm chromatin damage (by sperm chromatin structure assay and expressed as %DFI and %HDS) were evaluated.Sperm %DFI and %HDS in the hyperviscosity group and the control group and the relationship between the extent of semenogelin degradation and seminal viscosity.Semen volume in couples with moderate and high seminal viscosity was significantly lower as compared with the control group. In addition, total motility and normal morphology were significantly lower in the couples with high seminal viscosity as compared with the control group; however, there were no significant differences in sperm %DFI and %HDS between the hyperviscosity group and the control group. In addition, there was no relationship between the extent of semenogelin degradation and seminal viscosity.Our data suggest that seminal hyperviscosity (a posttesticular factor) is not an important cause of sperm DNA damage. Moreover, seminal hyperviscosity is not related to the degree of semenogelin degradation.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680362","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.837309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.833599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.684639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.455332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.445015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.223415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"DNA fragmentation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_fragmentation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Hitachi Data Systems","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_Data_Systems"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Hyperviscosity syndrome","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperviscosity_syndrome"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"DFI","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFI"}]}
