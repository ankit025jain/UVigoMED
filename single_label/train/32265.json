{"id":32265,"title":"Hemodynamic quantification in brain arteriovenous malformations with time-resolved spin-labeled magnetic resonance angiography.","abstract":"Unenhanced time-resolved spin-labeled magnetic resonance angiography enables hemodynamic quantification in arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Our purpose was to identify quantitative parameters that discriminate among different AVM components and to relate hemodynamic patterns with rupture risk.Sixteen patients presenting with AVMs (7 women, 9 men; mean age 37.1Â±15.9 years) were assigned to the high rupture risk or low rupture risk group according to anatomic AVM characteristics and rupture history. High temporal resolution (<70 ms) unenhanced time-resolved spin-labeled magnetic resonance angiography was performed on a 3-T MR system. After dedicated image processing, hemodynamic quantitative parameters were computed. T tests were used to compare quantitative parameters among AVM components, between the high rupture risk and low rupture risk groups, and between the hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic groups.Among the quantitative parameters, time-to-peak (P<0.001) and maximum outflow gradient (P=0.01) allowed discriminating various intranidal flow patterns with significantly different values between feeding arteries and draining veins. With 9 AVMs classified into the high rupture risk group (whose 6 were hemorrhagic) and 7 into the low rupture risk group, the observed venous-to-arterial time-to-peak ratio was significantly lower in the high rupture risk (P=0.003) and hemorrhagic (P=0.001) groups.Unenhanced time-resolved spin-labeled magnetic resonance angiography allows AVM-specific combined anatomic and quantitative analysis of AVM hemodynamics.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984747","annotations":[{"name":"Brain","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.456219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.381416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.381082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.173847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"3T","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3T"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.0291129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Angular resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Temporal resolution","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_resolution"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"}]}
