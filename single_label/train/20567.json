{"id":20567,"title":"[Brainstem encephalitis and myelitis due to Listeria monocytogenes: a case report and literature review].","abstract":"Brainstem encephalitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes is an uncommon form of central nervous system listeriosis; however, it is the most common presentation in immunocompetent individuals. Here, we describe an even more rare combination of rhombencephalitis with severe myelitis caused by L. monocytogenes in an immunocompetent patient. We report the case of a 21-year-old immunocompetent patient who consumed unpasteurized dairy products and experienced headache and vomiting that progressed to an impaired general condition, altered consciousness and ultimately death. The patient had presented to the Neurological Institute of Colombia (INDEC in Spanish) for consultation and was diagnosed with brainstem encephalitis and myelitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes . The differences between this particular case and those reported in the literature will be discussed. It is advisable to initiate antibiotic treatment for Listeria monocytogenes if a patient shows signs of brainstem compromise of possible infectious origin and quickly intensify treatment if there is no or minimal response. It is also necessary to extend radiological assessment to include the spinal column to rule out spinal cord involvement.
