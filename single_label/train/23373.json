{"id":23373,"title":"The utility of routine tuberculosis screening in county hospital patients with uveitis.","abstract":"To evaluate the utility of tuberculosis (TB) screening in diagnosing ocular TB in uveitis patients in a government-funded hospital.The charts of 142 consecutive patients seen during August 2011-July 2012 at the Los Angeles County Hospital uveitis clinic were reviewed for manifestation/laterality of uveitis, purified protein derivative (PPD) test results, interferon ? release assay, chest x-ray, birthplace, treatment history and diagnosis. 'Presumed TB-uveitis' was diagnosed when patients had positive TB screening and favourable response to anti-TB therapy, and definite ocular TB when Mycobacterium tuberculosis' presence was demonstrated. Post-test probabilities were determined.TB screening was positive in 21.1%. Six patients were diagnosed with TB-related uveitis: one definite, four presumed and one systemic TB with uveitis. With regard to PPD positivity, being foreign-born was the only statistically significant factor with OR of 2.26 (95% CI 1.01 to 5.13; p<0.01) if born in Mexico and 4.90 (95% CI 1.74 to 13.83; p<0.01) if born in other foreign countries. The post-test probabilities of a positive PPD in a uveitis patient showed a 17.2% (overall) or 30.3% (foreign-born patients) chance of ocular TB.PPD skin test plays an important role in the diagnosis of TB-associated uveitis in high-risk groups, such as immigrants from TB endemic regions.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24489378","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.749698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.611625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.306403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.155517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.150191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Los Angeles County, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California"},{"name":"Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County+USC_Medical_Center"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
