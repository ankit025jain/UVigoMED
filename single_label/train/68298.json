{"id":68298,"title":"CT urography for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney.","abstract":"Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is characterized by malformation of the terminal collecting ducts and is associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, urinary tract infections, renal acidification defects, and reduced bone density. It has been historically diagnosed with intravenous pyelography (IVP), which is falling out of favor as an imaging modality. CT urography (CTU) performed with multidetector CT (MDCT) has been shown to create images of the renal collecting system with similar detail as IVP; however, its utility in diagnosing MSK has not been defined.We present the first 15 patients with recurrent symptomatic nephrolithiasis who were evaluated in our renal stone clinic with CTU. Four patients were diagnosed with MSK after visualization of the characteristic radiologic findings.CTU effectively demonstrates the characteristic radiologic findings of MSK including collecting tubule dilatation, medullary nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and medullary cysts. Dose reduction protocols can reduce radiation exposure below that associated with conventional IVP. We propose CTU be considered for the diagnosis of MSK.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531190","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.890723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.797488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Collecting duct system","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collecting_duct_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.709815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.677207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Connecting tubule","weight":0.518855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_tubule"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.424892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.358217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Medullary sponge kidney","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_sponge_kidney"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.189614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.174353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.168036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Renal medulla","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_medulla"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Nephrocalcinosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrocalcinosis"},{"name":"Medulla oblongata","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
