{"id":36077,"title":"Predictive value of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, soluble ST2, and IL-33 in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important complication of preterm births. The soluble form of ST2 (sST2), interleukin-33 (IL-33), and soluble form of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) have attracted increasing attention as biomarkers for different diseases. The aim of the current study was to assess the predictive value of plasma sST2, IL-33, and suPAR levels in patients with risk of BPD development.A total of 38 babies were studied prospectively on delivery to the neonatal intensive care unit. Serum levels of IL-33, sST2, and suPAR were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum samples were collected from umbilical cord (at the time of delivery, termed CB) and peripheral blood (on day 14, termed PB).Levels of suPAR (PB-suPAR) and sST2 (PB-sST2) in the peripheral blood of the BPD group were significantly higher than the corresponding levels in the non-BPD group (P < 0.001, P = 0.028, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlation between PB-suPAR levels and the severity of BPD (P < 0.001)) when the suPAR results were analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.PB-suPAR and PB-sST2 levels are sensitive and specific independent predictive biomarkers in preterm babies with BPD.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal
