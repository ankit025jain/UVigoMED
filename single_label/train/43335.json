{"id":43335,"title":"Imaging strategies before beginning treatment of colorectal liver metastases.","abstract":"The management of colorectal intrahepatic metastases before resection is multidisciplinary and radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists play a major role. In accordance with the French National Guide for appropriate use of diagnostic imaging, the approach should be multimodal: a chest-abdomen and pelvic (CAP) CT scan and hepatic MRI are mandatory while PET-CT provides important additional information, in particular on intra-abdominal extrahepatic metastases. This multimodal approach emphasizes the importance of early and appropriate use of imaging in these patients, as well as the central role of multidisciplinary meetings in oncology.
