{"id":63539,"title":"F-18 FDG PET/CT quantization parameters as predictors of outcome in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"We evaluated the prognostic significance of standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) obtained by F-18 FDG PET/CT (PET/CT) in patients with diffuse large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) presenting intermediate IPI score.Fifty-two patients (61 Â± 13 yr) underwent PET/CT before the first-line chemotherapy. The mean SUVmax value, the summed MTV (cm(3) ; 42% threshold), and the cumulative TLG (g) were registered. The patients were followed up 18 months thereafter (range 3-41 months). The PET/CT results were compared to the event-free survival (EFS).At univariate analysis, SUVmax and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were predictive, but discordantly. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for SUVmax showed a significant better EFS in patients presenting higher values as compared to those having lesser (P = 0.0002, HR 0.13). Summed MTV and cumulative TLG were not suitable for predicting EFS.Despite the availability of new tools for the quantitative assessment of disease activity on PET/CT, the SUVmax rather than MTV and TLG remains the only predictor for EFS in DLBCL patients. The magnitude of glycolytic activity rather than the amount of metabolically active burden holds a predominant value for determining the response to chemotherapy in DLBCL.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428392","annotations":[{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.698868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.681261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.674475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.608237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.446084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"MTV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Encrypting File System","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypting_File_System"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Quantum mechanics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics"}]}
