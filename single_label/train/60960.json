{"id":60960,"title":"Motility and trafficking in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Review).","abstract":"B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) consist of a wide spectrum of entities and consequently have varied clinical courses. Like many other malignancies, each of the B-NHL depend on their microenvironment for growth and survival; therefore, understanding the factors involved in their tissue localisation is likely to have implications for therapies designed to treat B-NHL. This review summarises the chemokines, integrins and sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors involved in normal B cell location and distribution within the lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow). It also provides a pr√©cis of what is known about these factors in the disease state: i.e., in some subtypes of B-NHL.
