{"id":43870,"title":"A challenging alfa-fetoprotein in a cirrhotic patient.","abstract":"A 57-year-old Italian man was admitted to our Hospital for investigation of a progressively raising alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) on the background of chronic hepatitis B infection. At abdominal imaging,liver morphology was suspected for advanced fibrosis but without any focal lesion. Clinical and ultrasonographic examinations were negative for testicular masses. When the patient was screened for gastroesophageal varices, upper intestinal endoscopy did not show signs of portal hypertension, while it revealed a gastric lesion which was histologically characterized as hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS), with strong immunohistochemical positivity for AFP. The patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy and AFP fell within the normal range. This is a very rare case in which AFP-producing gastric cancer (AFPPGC), in the form of HAS, presented in a patient with chronic liver disease. Physicians should be particularly aware of AFPPGC when following patients with liver disorders due to the common use of AFP in this setting.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761692","annotations":[{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.778737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.544451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.535822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.482866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.42868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.322626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
