{"id":9203,"title":"Role of RyR2 phosphorylation in heart failure and arrhythmias: protein kinase A-mediated hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor at serine 2808 does not alter cardiac contractility or cause heart failure and arrhythmias.","abstract":"This Controversies in Research article discusses the hypothesis that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the Ryanodine Receptor (RyR) at a single serine (RyRS2808) is essential for normal sympathetic regulation of cardiac myocyte contractility and is responsible for the disturbed Ca(2+) regulation that underlies depressed contractility in heart failure. Studies supporting this hypothesis have associated hyperphosphorylation of RyRS2808 and heart failure progression in animals and humans and have shown that a phosphorylation defective RyR mutant mouse (RyRS2808A) does not respond normally to sympathetic agonists and does not exhibit heart failure symptoms after myocardial infarction. Studies to confirm and extend these ideas have failed to support the original data. Experiments from many different laboratories have convincingly shown that PKA-mediated RyRS2808 phosphorylation does not play any significant role in the normal sympathetic regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release or cardiac contractility. Hearts and myocytes from RyRS2808A mice have been shown to respond normally to sympathetic agonists, and to increase Ca(2+) influx, Ca(2+) transients, and Ca(2+) efflux. Although the RyR is involved in heart failure-related Ca(2+) disturbances, this results from Ca(2+)-calmodulin kinase II and reactive oxygen species-mediated regulation rather than by RyR2808 phosphorylation. Also, a new study has shown that RyRS2808A mice are not protected from myocardial infarction. Collectively, there is now a clear consensus in the published literature showing that dysregulated RyRs contribute to the altered Ca(2+) regulatory phenotype of the failing heart, but PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RyRS2808 has little or no role in these alterations.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723657","annotations":[{"name":"Protein kinase A","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Ryanodine receptor","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanodine_receptor"},{"name":"Calmodulin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmodulin"},{"name":"Sarcoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.884894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.870187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Contractility","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractility"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.548191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.468758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.337968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.332004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.328827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ryanodine","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanodine"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.244872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Ryanodine receptor 2","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanodine_receptor_2"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
