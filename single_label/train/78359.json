{"id":78359,"title":"Risk of otitis externa following manual cerumen removal.","abstract":"Based on an interpretation of a recent Joint Commission protocol to sterilize instruments coming into contact with mucous membranes, there has been institutional interest in sterile packaging of cerumen curettes used for manual cerumen removal. To date, there are no studies that have assessed the risk of otitis externa (OE) following cerumen removal and the utility of sterile packaging is questionable. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of OE following cerumen disimpaction prior to the implementation of sterile packaging at our institution.This was a retrospective chart review. Over a I-year period, 1457 episodes of manual cerumen removal took place in the otolaryngology clinic. Charts were assessed for signs or symptoms of OE within 2 weeks of the procedure through follow-up phone calls and clinic visits in the otolaryngology division.There were no patients who followed up with symptoms or signs suggestive of OE in the 2-week postprocedure period.There is no evidence that OE is a complication of manual cerumen removal when performed by otolaryngologists using clean technique. Unnecessary sterilization of tools leads to increased cost and time for this common outpatient procedure performed by the otolaryngologist.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690982","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.396334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.390671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.168519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Earwax","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earwax"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.0668393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Joint Commission","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Commission"},{"name":"Otitis externa","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_externa"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"1457","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1457"},{"name":"Division (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Periodontal curette","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_curette"},{"name":"Old English","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
