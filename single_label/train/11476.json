{"id":11476,"title":"Dectin-2 promotes house dust mite-induced T helper type 2 and type 17 cell differentiation and allergic airway inflammation in mice.","abstract":"The fact that sensitization against fungi is closely related to the severity of asthma suggests that immune systems recognizing fungi are involved in the pathogenesis of severe asthma. Recently, Dectin-2 (gene symbol, Clec4n), a C-type lectin receptor, has been shown to function as not only a major pattern-recognition receptor for fungi, but also a receptor for some components of house dust mite (HDM) extract, a major allergen for asthma. However, the roles of Dectin-2 in the induction of HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation remain largely unknown. Our objective was to determine the roles of Dectin-2 in HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation. We examined the roles of Dectin-2 in the induction of HDM-induced T helper (Th) 2 and Th17 cell differentiation and subsequent allergic airway inflammation by using Clec4n-deficient (Clec4n(-/-)) mice. We also investigated Dectin-2-expressing cells in the lung and their roles in HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation. Clec4n(-/-) mice showed significantly attenuated HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation and decreased Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation. Dectin-2 mRNA, together with Dectin-3 and Fc receptor-? mRNAs, was expressed in CD11b(+) dendritic cells (DCs), but not in CD4(+) T cells or epithelial cells in the lung. CD11b(+) DCs isolated from Clec4n(-/-) mice expressed lower amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules, which could lead to Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation than those from wild-type mice. HDM-pulsed Clec4n(-/-) DCs were less efficient for the induction of allergic airway inflammation than HDM-pulsed wild-type DCs. In conclusion, Dectin-2 expressed on CD11b(+) DCs promotes HDM-induced Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation and allergic airway inflammation.
