{"id":84469,"title":"Factor structure of the Chinese version of the Meaning in Life Questionnaire among Hong Kong Chinese caregivers.","abstract":"This study examines the factor structure of the Chinese version of the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (C-MLQ) in a sample of Hong Kong Chinese caregivers of patients with chronic illness (N = 223). Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine the factor structure. Findings confirm that, identical to the original version, C-MLQ showed the same two-factor structure: Presence and Search. Correlation between Presence and Search was found to be positive and moderate (r = .47). This study establishes empirically the same factor structure as the original version of MLQ among caregivers in Hong Kong. The relationship between Presence and Meaning is discussed in the contexts of Chinese culture and caregiving. Results suggest caregivers' continuing need for meaning in life. Medical social workers may help caregivers to integrate their caregiving experience with their sense of meaning in life and search for meaning in life to sustain their caregiving role.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095626","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.529832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.506114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.371966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.341148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Culture of China","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_China"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"China","weight":0.162488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Meaning of life","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"},{"name":"Confirmatory factor analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Meaning (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
