{"id":63205,"title":"Cyclophosphamide alters the gene expression profile in patients treated with high doses prior to stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment for several haematological malignancies. However, treatment related morbidity and mortality still is a limiting factor. Cyclophosphamide is widely used in condition regimens either in combination with other chemotherapy or with total body irradiation.We present the gene expression profile during cyclophosphamide treatment in 11 patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide for 2 days followed by total body irradiation prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 299 genes were identified as specific for cyclophosphamide treatment and were arranged into 4 clusters highly down-regulated genes, highly up-regulated genes, early up-regulated but later normalized genes and moderately up-regulated genes.Cyclophosphamide treatment down-regulated expression of several genes mapped to immune/autoimmune activation and graft rejection including CD3, CD28, CTLA4, MHC II, PRF1, GZMB and IL-2R, and up-regulated immune-related receptor genes, e.g. IL1R2, IL18R1, and FLT3. Moreover, a high and significant expression of ANGPTL1 and c-JUN genes was observed independent of cyclophosphamide treatment.This is the first investigation to provide significant information about alterations in gene expression following cyclophosphamide treatment that may increase our understanding of the cyclophosphamide mechanism of action and hence, in part, avoid its toxicity. Furthermore, ANGPTL1 remained highly expressed throughout the treatment and, in contrast to several other alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide did not influence c-JUN expression.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466173","annotations":[{"name":"Perforin","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforin"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"CD28","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD28"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Total body irradiation","weight":0.778993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_body_irradiation"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.738156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.615023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.588611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.522154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.500017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.421397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alkylation","weight":0.404445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.365311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.339867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"IL-2 receptor","weight":0.281588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL-2_receptor"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"CD135","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD135"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
