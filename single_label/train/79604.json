{"id":79604,"title":"Human monocyte subsets at homeostasis and their perturbation in numbers and function in filarial infection.","abstract":"To characterize the function and plasticity of the major human circulating monocyte populations and to explore their role in systemic helminth infection, highly purified (by flow-based sorting) human monocyte subsets (CD14(hi)/CD16(neg) [classical], CD14(+ or hi)/CD16(med) [intermediate], and CD14(neg)/CD16(hi) [nonclassical]) were examined at homeostasis and after activation. Among these three subsets the classical and intermediate subsets were found to be the major sources of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, as well as cytokines/chemokines associated with alternative activation, whereas the nonclassical and classical populations demonstrated an ability to transmigrate through endothelial monolayers. Moreover, it was primarily the classical subset that was the most efficient in promoting autologous T cell proliferation. The distribution of these subsets changed in the context of a systemic helminth (Wuchereria bancrofti) infection such that patent infection altered the frequency and distribution of these monocyte subsets with the nonclassical monocytes being expanded (almost 2-fold) in filarial infection. To understand further the filarial/monocyte interface, in vitro modeling demonstrated that the classical subset internalized filarial antigens more efficiently than the other two subsets but that the parasite-driven regulatory cytokine interleukin-10 was exclusively coming from the intermediate subset. Our data suggest that monocyte subsets have a differential function at homeostasis and in response to helminth parasites.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25114121","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.837808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.631157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.615888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.517413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.403971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.398267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.299442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.203104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Filariasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filariasis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
