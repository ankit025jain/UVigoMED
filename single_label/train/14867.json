{"id":14867,"title":"Role of nitric oxide in the regulation of motor function. An overview of behavioral, biochemical and histological studies in animal models.","abstract":"A compelling body of evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO), a unique gaseous neurotransmitter and neuromodulator plays a key role in the regulation of motor function. Recently, the interest of researchers concentrates on the NO - soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) - cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling pathway in the striatum as a new target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the study is to review the available literature referring to the role of NO in the integration of basal ganglia functions. First, attention has been focused on behavioral effects of NO donors and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitors in the modulation of motor behavior. Then, disturbances in the nitrergic neurotransmission in PD and its 6-OHDA animal model have been presented. Moreover, the most current data demonstrating the contribution of both dopamine and glutamate to the regulation of NO biosynthesis in the striatum have been analyzed. Finally, the role of NO in the tonic and phasic dopamine release as well as in the regulation of striatal output pathways also has been discussed.
