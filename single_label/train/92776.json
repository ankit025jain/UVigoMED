The data of investigated children's contingent with intestinal colic prevailed by following comorbidities: SARS--12 (18.18% ± 4.78%), protein-energy malnutrition--9 (12.85% ± 3.82%), pneumonia--6 (8.57% ± 3.57%), atopic dermatitis--7 (10.00% ±.3.57%). All children have a next complaints: flatulence (100%), in the 62 children (88.57% ± 3.82%) were identificated frequent regurgitation, in the 48 (80.33%)--hyperbilirubinemia. ALT levels were elevated in 25 children (41%) and 31 (51.66%) children had increased levels of AST. IL8 level were elevated in the 40 children (71.42%). The level of antibodies to elastase was greatly increased in all 56 (100%) children.","date":"2014-12-22","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528833","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome"},{"name":"Flatulence","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.731062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Elastase","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastase"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.660562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.582375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.418952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Horse colic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_colic"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0248623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Contingency (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(philosophy)"}]}
