{"id":73555,"title":"Somatostatin receptor-based PET/CT of intracranial tumors: a potential area of application for 68 Ga-DOTA peptides?","abstract":"Similar to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) at other sites, a wide array of intracranial tumors also express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). This expression can be exploited for both imaging and therapy. The introduction of (68)Ga-labeled tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA)-peptide PET/CT has given new dimension to SSTR-based imaging because of its improved sensitivity and excellent spatial resolution.However, in contrast to gastropancreatic and bronchopulmonary NETs, limited literature is available regarding the use of (68)Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT in intracranial tumors. Here, we briefly review the available literature and highlight the potential role that (68)Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT can play in the management of intracranial tumors.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896203","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.429918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.271872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Angular resolution","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0193971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Somatostatin receptor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin_receptor"}]}
