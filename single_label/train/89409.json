{"id":89409,"title":"DLS 5.0--the biomechanical effects of dynamic locking screws.","abstract":"Indirect reduction of dia-/metaphyseal fractures with minimally invasive implant application bridges the fracture zone in order to protect the soft-tissue and blood supply. The goal of this fixation strategy is to allow stable motion at the fracture site to achieve indirect bone healing with callus formation. However, concerns have arisen that the high axial stiffness and eccentric position of locked plating constructs may suppress interfragmentary motion and callus formation, particularly under the plate. The reason for this is an asymmetric fracture movement. The biological need for sufficient callus formation and secondary bone healing is three-dimensional micro movement in the fracture zone. The DLS was designed to allow for increased fracture site motion. The purpose of the current study was to determine the biomechanical effect of the DLS_5.0.Twelve surrogate bone models were used for analyzing the characteristics of the DLS_5.0. The axial stiffness and the interfragmentary motion of locked plating constructs with DLS were compared to conventional constructs with Locking Head Screws (LS_5.0). A quasi-static axial load of 0 to 2.5 kN was applied. Relative motion was measured.The dynamic system showed a biphasic axial stiffness distribution and provided a significant reduction of the initial axial stiffness of 74.4%. Additionally, the interfragmentary motion at the near cortex increased significantly from 0.033 mm to 0.210 mm (at 200N).The DLS may ultimately be an improvement over the angular stable plate osteosynthesis. The advantages of the angular stability are not only preserved but even supplemented by a dynamic element which leads to homogenous fracture movement and to a potentially uniform callus distribution.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and
