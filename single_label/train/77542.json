{"id":77542,"title":"A pilot risk assessment study of strontium chromate among painters in the aeronautical industry.","abstract":"A method for risk assessment of occupational exposure to strontium chromate (SrCrO4) in painters employed in the aeronautical industry is described.Assessment was made of 21 male workers of the painting division, potentially exposed to SrCrO4 (exposed), and 20 male workers of the tests and warehouse divisions (controls). All participants completed a questionnaire about work tasks, lifestyle habits, hobbies and diet. Personal active sampling for the determination of Cr and Sr was performed both during paint-spraying and during other operations in the painting division area. On the same day as environmental sampling, urine samples were collected at the beginning and end of the work shift in exposed workers to determine urinary chromium (CrU), and only at the end of the shift in controls. In the second half of the shift, a blood sample was taken in 10 exposed workers and 10 controls, to determine Cr in plasma (CrP) and in red blood cells (CrRBC).During paint-spraying, Cr concentrations ranged between 1.38 and 17.10 microg/m3, versus 0.02 to 0.07 microg/mi in the painting division area, while the Sr concentration was 22.90 microg/m3 in the paint-spray booth versus 0.07 microg/m3 in the painting division area. CrU at the end of the work shift, CrP and CrRBC, did not show significant differences between exposed workers and controls. Moreover, in exposed workers there were no differences between CrU measured at the beginning and at the end of the work shift.This approach, consisting of simultaneous environmental and biological monitoring, suggested no absorption of chromium in the painters thanks to the efficacy of the technical, organizational and personal protection measures adopted. However, the evident exposure to high levels of SrCrO4 during paint-spraying highlights how absolutely essential it is to ensure strict compliance with all the preventive measures foreseen by the EU and national regulations for occupational exposure to carcinogens.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640832","annotations":[{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.611491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.520011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Chromium","weight":0.398736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.398606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.333672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Strontium","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.175264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Biomonitoring","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomonitoring"},{"name":"Painting","weight":0.0314205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting"},{"name":"Chromate and dichromate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromate_and_dichromate"},{"name":"Aeronautics","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hobby","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby"},{"name":"Personal protective equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Ethology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"}]}
