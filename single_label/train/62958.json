{"id":62958,"title":"Serum microRNA155 is increased in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease.","abstract":"To explore the clinical relevance of three lymphocyte-related serum microRNAs (miR-155, miR-214, and miR-326) to the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 64 subjects who received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) were recruited in this study, of whom 19 subjects did not develop GVHD, 25 subjects were diagnosed with acute GVHD (aGVHD), and 20 subjects were diagnosed with chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Serum miRNAs were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Expression level of miRNAs and the expression signatures of miRNAs as a panel were analyzed among the three groups. The expression level of miR-214 and miR-326 showed no significant difference between GVHD and non-GVHD groups. However, miR-155 was significantly up-regulated in GVHD patients. There was a correlation between the level of miR-155 and the severity of aGVHD. Moreover, serum IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-9 levels were higher in aGVHD patients with high miR-155. In conclusion, the expression level of lymphocyte-related miR-155 in serum was significantly increased in aGVHD patients. The miR-155 may be considered as a potential targeted therapy for aGVHD patients.
