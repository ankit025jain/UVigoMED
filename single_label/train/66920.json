{"id":66920,"title":"Nephrotoxic effects of designer drugs: synthetic is not better!","abstract":"Designer drugs are synthetic, psychoactive substances with similar structures and activity to existing scheduled drugs or controlled chemical compounds. The use of these drugs is not generally considered illegal and they cannot be detected using standard toxicology tests--essentially they are considered to be 'legal highs'. Over the past several years, increasing numbers of designer drugs have become available. These drugs are classified as amphetamine derivatives, phenylpiperazine derivatives, synthetic cathinones, synthetic cannabinoids, phencyclidine derivatives and synthetic opioids. Although euphoria is the desired effect, neuropsychiatric and cardiac manifestations are frequently observed in individuals using these drugs at high doses or using drugs that are contaminated with other substances. Some designer drugs are also associated with adverse renal effects, including acute kidney injury from pigment nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis, obstructive nephropathy and hyponatraemia. The misuse of these drugs should be recognized and clinicians made aware of the potential for acute nephrotoxicity as the health burden of these compounds increases.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662435","annotations":[{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Phencyclidine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine"},{"name":"Hyponatremia","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Euphoria","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Designer drug","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_drug"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.698509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.614623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.582528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.504678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.445466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.434824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.270684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Phenylpiperazine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpiperazine"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
