{"id":80088,"title":"Hepatozoon canis in German red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and their ticks: molecular characterization and the phylogenetic relationship to other Hepatozoon spp.","abstract":"In this study, the prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and their ticks from Germany, as well as molecular characterizations and phylogenetic relationship to other Hepatozoon spp. were investigated. DNA extracts of 261 spleen samples and 1,953 ticks were examined for the presence of Hepatozoon spp. by a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 18S rRNA gene. The ticks included four tick species: Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes canisuga, Ixodes hexagonus and Dermacentor reticulatus. A total of 118/261 foxes (45.2%) and 148/1,953 ticks (7.5%) were Hepatozoon PCR-positive. Amplicons from 36 positive foxes and 41 positive ticks were sequenced. All sequences obtained from foxes and 39/41 from ticks had a 99% similarity to Hepatozoon canis, whereas two ticks' sequences had a 99% identity to Hepatozoon sp. The obtained Hepatozoon sequences in this study were phylogenetically related to other Hepatozoon sequences detected in other countries, which may represent strain variants. The high prevalence of H. canis DNA in red foxes in this study supports the suggested role of those animals in distribution of this parasite. Furthermore, detection of DNA of H. canis in foxes and all examined tick species collected from those foxes allows speculating about previously undescribed potential vectors for H. canis and suggests a potential role of the red fox in its natural endemic cycles.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802869","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.890122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.853292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.784596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.742258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Red Fox","weight":0.710732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fox"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.684281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.572564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Binomial nomenclature","weight":0.480451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"},{"name":"Ixodes ricinus","weight":0.462771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_ricinus"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.429766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Fox","weight":0.315301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox"},{"name":"Ixodes","weight":0.217453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes"},{"name":"Canis","weight":0.186179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.181906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"18S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Vulpes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpes"},{"name":"Dermacentor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermacentor"},{"name":"Ixodes hexagonus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_hexagonus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Speculation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
