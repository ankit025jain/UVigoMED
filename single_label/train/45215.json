{"id":45215,"title":"Bowel preparation for colonoscopy with magnesium sulphate and low-volume polyethylene glycol.","abstract":"Patient compliance with bowel cleansing procedures represents one of the most objectionable aspects of colonoscopy. Adverse reactions to the purgative may result in failure to complete the preparation, inadequate visualization of the colon, polyp and even carcinoma miss rate and unwillingness to attend a follow-up colonoscopy. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of bowel cleansing with magnesium sulphate and low-volume polyethylene glycol (PEG) with electrolytes. The second objective was to evaluate whether bowel cleansing was better in participants scheduled for morning colonoscopies or afternoon colonoscopies.Magnesium sulphate mineral water (2 l) and 2 l of low-volume PEG and electrolytes solution were used as our bowel cleansing protocol. A total of 13 914 participants, who participated in the Slovenian colorectal cancer screening programme in the period between 2009 and 2011, were included.Excellent bowel preparation was achieved in 11 484 (82.61%) participants; 1894 (13.62%) participants had good bowel preparation, 439 (3.16%) participants had fair bowel preparation and 85 (0.61%) participants had poor bowel preparation. Better results were achieved in the afternoon colonoscopies and in younger participant groups (P<0.001). No serious side effects of bowel cleansing were reported.This is the first study to use magnesium sulphate mineral water and PEG plus electrolytes for bowel cleansing. We found excellent bowel cleansing in 82.61% participants and in more participants if colonoscopy was performed in the afternoon.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694759","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Laxative","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Magnesium sulfate","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Colon cleansing","weight":0.291275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_cleansing"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mineral water","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_water"},{"name":"Slovenia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"}]}
