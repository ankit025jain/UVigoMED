{"id":34822,"title":"Transarterial embolization of mandibular arteriovenous malformations using ONYX.","abstract":"To document the efficacy of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (ONYX; ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA) in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the mandible.A retrospective consecutive series of patients with facial AVMs isolated to the mandible and immediate perimandibular tissue was identified at 2 institutions. The primary treatment modality of transarterial embolization using ONYX was performed by way of the external carotid artery branches. Staged procedures were accomplished until no arteriovenous shunt remained. A 1-year follow-up angiogram was obtained for each patient.Three patients, aged 8 (patient 1), 16 (patient 2), and 17 (patient 3) years presented with bleeding from facial AVMs isolated to the mandible. Patient 1 was female and patients 2 and 3 were male. The 2 older patients had loose molar or canine dentition. Transarterial embolization with ONYX achieved complete angiographic closure of the arteriovenous shunt in each patient. A total of 1, 6, and 3 staged embolization procedures were performed in the 3 patients. Patient 2 had mild transient facial numbness after embolization that completely resolved. Patient 3 had loose molars associated with the AVM that were extracted for treatment of intraprocedural bleeding. The 1-year angiographic follow-up data demonstrated durable closure of all 3 lesions.Transarterial embolization of high-flow intraosseus mandibular AVMs was safely accomplished with ONYX in our small retrospective cohort. Complete, durable occlusion was found on the angiogram at 1 year, with clinical stability extending to an average of 3 years. Surgical resection of the AVM was avoided in all 3 patients.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704035","annotations":[{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.829982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"External carotid artery","weight":0.777315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.727534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.475032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.459444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.376959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.345162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.340674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.268427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.177599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene"},{"name":"Copolymer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
