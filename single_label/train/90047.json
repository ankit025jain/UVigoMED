{"id":90047,"title":"Does analgesic overuse contribute to chronic post-traumatic headaches in adolescent concussion patients?","abstract":"The causes of persistent headache following concussion are poorly understood. The objective of this study is to explore analgesic overuse as a potential cause of chronic post-traumatic headache among adolescents referred to a headache clinic following concussion.A retrospective chart review was conducted of all adolescent concussion patients referred to our pediatric headache clinic over the 16-month period between August 1, 2011, and November 30, 2012. Those patients with chronic post-traumatic headaches of 3-12 months' duration who also met International Headache Society criteria for probable medication-overuse headache were identified. Demographic data, concussion symptoms, and headache features were characterized from the initial evaluation and from follow-up visits.Of 104 adolescent concussion patients referred during the study period, 77 had chronic post-traumatic headache of 3-12 months' duration. Fifty-four of 77 (70.1%) met criteria for probable medication-overuse headache. Only simple analgesics were overused. Thirty-seven patients (68.5%) had resolution of headaches or improvements to preconcussion headache patterns after discontinuing analgesics; seven (13%) had no change in headaches or worsening of headaches after discontinuing analgesics and 10 (18.5%) did not discontinue analgesics or were lost to follow-up.Excessive use of analgesics postconcussion may contribute to chronic post-traumatic headaches in some adolescents. Management of patients with chronic post-traumatic headache should include analgesic detoxification when medication overuse is suspected.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656666","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.673369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.532968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.351631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.162206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International Headache Society","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Headache_Society"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"August 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_1"},{"name":"November 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_30"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
