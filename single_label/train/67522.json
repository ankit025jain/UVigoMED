{"id":67522,"title":"Survival in patients with high-risk prostate cancer is predicted by miR-221, which regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting IRF2 and SOCS3.","abstract":"A lack of reliably informative biomarkers to distinguish indolent and lethal prostate cancer is one reason this disease is overtreated. miR-221 has been suggested as a biomarker in high-risk prostate cancer, but there is insufficient evidence of its potential utility. Here we report that miR-221 is an independent predictor for cancer-related death, extending and validating earlier findings. By mechanistic investigations we showed that miR-221 regulates cell growth, invasiveness, and apoptosis in prostate cancer at least partially via STAT1/STAT3-mediated activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. miR-221 directly inhibits the expression of SOCS3 and IRF2, two oncogenes that negatively regulate this signaling pathway. miR-221 expression sensitized prostate cancer cells for IFN-?-mediated growth inhibition. Our findings suggest that miR-221 offers a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in high-risk prostate cancer.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607843","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.76081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"STAT1","weight":0.73581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT1"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.562795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.531806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.376036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.320468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.306273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"SOCS3","weight":0.201603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCS3"},{"name":"IRF2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF2"},{"name":"Interferon regulatory factors","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_regulatory_factors"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
