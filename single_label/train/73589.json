{"id":73589,"title":"Accuracy of non-operative identification of the sentinel lymph node using combined gamma and ultrasound scanning.","abstract":"To assess how accurately the sentinel lymph node (SLN) can be identified percutaneously, using gamma probe and ultrasound technology.Women with breast cancer, scheduled for wide local excision or mastectomy with SLN biopsy (SLNB), were included. Peri-areolar intradermal injection of technetium-99 nanocolloid was performed on the morning of surgery and 1-2 ml of blue dye was injected in the peri-areolar region once the patient was anaesthetized. Prior to surgery, a gamma probe was used over the skin to identify any hot spot that could represent a SLN. Ultrasound, guided by the hot spot, was then used to visualize potential SLNs and guide the insertion of a localizing wire. The accuracy in localizing the SLN by preoperative gamma-probe guided ultrasonography was assessed by comparison to SLNB.A SLN was correctly identified and marked using gamma-probe guided ultrasonography in 44 of 59 cases (75%; 95% CI: 63-86%).This study supports the case for investigating percutaneous gamma probe and ultrasound guided interventions in the axilla in women with breast cancer, as a potential alternative to surgical SLNB.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894653","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.739134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Areola","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areola"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.598289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.479371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Wide local excision","weight":0.415019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_local_excision"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.262741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.245291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
