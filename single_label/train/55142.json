{"id":55142,"title":"Outcomes of cataract surgery in patients with uveitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"To critically assess the evidence base regarding outcomes following cataract surgery in uveitic cases.Systematic evidence-based review and meta-analysis.A comprehensive search query was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and CENTRAL databases. Relevant publications were identified by reviewing query results and reference list searches.A total of 89 articles met eligibility criteria. Among uveitic eyes with quiet or mostly quiet uveitis before cataract surgery, 20/40 visual acuity or better (?20/40) was achieved in 68% following phacoemulsification, 72% following extracapsular cataract extraction, and 40% following pars plana lensectomy. More eyes undergoing cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation than eyes left aphakic achieved ?20/40 postoperatively (71% vs 52%). Eyes receiving acrylic IOLs or heparin-surface-modified (HSM) polymethylmethacrylate had better visual outcomes than those receiving non-HSM polymethylmethacrylate or silicone IOLs. Active uveitis at the time of cataract surgery was associated with worse visual outcomes. Compared with other uveitis cases, the proportion achieving 20/40 or better post cataract surgery was better for Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis cases and worse for uveitis related to Beh√ßet disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, or sympathetic ophthalmia, and also posterior uveitis in general.Cataract surgery in eyes with uveitis resulted in normal range levels of visual acuity in most cases. The review suggests that preoperative control of uveitis, use of an acrylic or HSM IOL, and a diagnosis of Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis were associated with better outcomes. Posterior-involving uveitides tended to do worse, likely because of vision-limiting complications of uveitis. Average results may not be applicable to specific clinical scenarios.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983790","annotations":[{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.822519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.809037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.769436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.685842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.439048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Aphakia","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.212711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.171955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.0615814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Heterochromia iridum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
