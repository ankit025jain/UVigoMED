{"id":67116,"title":"Vascular anastomosis for paediatric renal transplantation and new strategy in low-weight children.","abstract":"The technical aspects of RT in low-weight children should be specific, particularly with regard to VA. This retrospective study assesses the main VA options in paediatric RTs and proposes a new strategy for renal artery trajectory when using the Ao and the right iVC. The sample included 81 patients and was categorized into a group of children weighing <16 kg and the other group of children weighing 16 kg or more. The smaller children received the graft predominantly on the Ao and iVC (63%); however, the VA options varied in children weighing more than 16 kg, with anastomoses predominantly to the common iliac vessels (46%). In the first group, when the Ao was the selected vessel for anastomosis on the right side, the trajectory adopted for the transplanted kidney artery was posterior to the iVC. This strategy may reduce the risk of compression of the iVC by the renal artery of the donor kidney and may reconstitute the normal anatomy of the renal artery. Moreover, it did not represent a risk factor for graft loss in this sample.
