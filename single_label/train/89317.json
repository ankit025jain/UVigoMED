{"id":89317,"title":"Indications, selection, and use of distant pedicled flap for upper limb reconstruction.","abstract":"Despite the inherent advantages of free flaps for soft tissue cover in upper limb reconstruction, pedicled flaps remain the workhorse in many centers worldwide. Presumed disadvantages of pedicled flaps are that it requires multiple stages, longer hospital stay, are bulky, and primary reconstruction of composite defects cannot be done. Refinements in technique during planning can offset many of the disadvantages. Pedicled flaps are quick and easy to raise and do not need any special microsurgical expertise. Where free flaps are not possible or they fail, pedicled flaps are the lifeboat. An upper limb reconstructive surgeon must be adept at performing these flaps in challenging situations.
