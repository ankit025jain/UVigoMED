{"id":75992,"title":"COX inhibitors for the treatment of migraine.","abstract":"Migraine is a common headache disorder that causes significant disability. COX inhibitors (also referred to as NSAIDs) are a frequently used treatment option.A PubMed search provided articles relating to migraine and COX inhibitors. This article reviews the mechanism of action of NSAIDs in migraine, specifically the inhibition of COX isoenzymes and prostaglandin synthesis. Their central and peripheral effects are reviewed. The evidence for the use of NSAIDs in acute, preventive and rescue therapy, as well as other special circumstances, is discussed.We use NSAIDs as first-line acute treatment for migraine in both out-patient and in-patient settings, as well as for preventive treatment in menstrual migraine. We also employ NSAIDS as a bridge therapy. We feel more research is needed to develop a greater variation of dosage forms for current NSAIDs as well as more combination therapies.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010639","annotations":[{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.879595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.739524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.704798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Isozyme","weight":0.559079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isozyme"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.519236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.505245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.397303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dosage form","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosage_form"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.115793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}]}
