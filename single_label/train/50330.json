{"id":50330,"title":"Expression profiles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated proteins in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.","abstract":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been suggested to contribute to tumor progression and acquisition of therapeutic resistance. To assess the clinical significance of EMT-associated proteins, we evaluated the expression of Snail and Slug, the key regulators of EMT, in the primary ovarian cancer samples (n = 103) by immunohistochemistry. Snail was differentially expressed according to the histologic subtype (P = 0.001) and was predominantly expressed in serous and endometrioid types. In the serous and endometrioid adenocarcinomas, the expression of Snail remained high across the stage and grade, suggesting its role in the early phase of carcinogenesis. However, the expression of Snail and Slug was not related to chemoresistance and poor prognosis and did not serve as independent predictive or prognostic marker.
