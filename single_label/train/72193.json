{"id":72193,"title":"Functional regulation of phospholipase D expression in cancer and inflammation.","abstract":"Phospholipase D (PLD) regulates downstream effectors by generating phosphatidic acid. Growing links of dysregulation of PLD to human disease have spurred interest in therapeutics that target its function. Aberrant PLD expression has been identified in multiple facets of complex pathological states, including cancer and inflammatory diseases. Thus, it is important to understand how the signaling network of PLD expression is regulated and contributes to progression of these diseases. Interestingly, small molecule PLD inhibitors can suppress PLD expression as well as enzymatic activity of PLD and have been shown to be effective in pathological mice models, suggesting the potential for use of PLD inhibitors as therapeutics against cancer and inflammation. Here, we summarize recent scientific developments regarding the regulation of PLD expression and its role in cancer and inflammatory processes.
