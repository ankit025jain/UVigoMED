{"id":79083,"title":"[Evaluation of the use of hyaluronic acid in iatrogenic scars after phonosurgery (excluding surgical oncology) and ligamento-epithelial abnormalities of the vocal cords].","abstract":"Between January of 2007 and December of 2011, six patients underwent revision microphonosurgery because of scarring complicating the initial surgery. The technique consisted of detaching the scarred area, the insertion of fibrils of hyaluronic acid (Merogel), a microsuture and possibly intra-cordal fat injection. A pre-and post-operative phoniatric protocol assessed the results which appear encouraging.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494334","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.260458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.222269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.153297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.104468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.0699785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cord (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_(unit)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Fibril","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"}]}
