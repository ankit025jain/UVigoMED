{"id":47303,"title":"[Open coloproctectomy with ileoanal J-pouch reconstruction].","abstract":"Coloproctectomy is a visceral surgical intervention where the complete colon and rectum are removed up to the level of the pelvic floor or pectinate line and the anal canal. As a rule the anal canal and pelvic floor musculature including the anal sphincter muscle remain intact. The ileoanal J-pouch construction has become established as treatment of choice for reconstruction of the small intestine. This article presents the approach for open coloproctectomy with ileoanal J-pouch reconstruction by means of an operation video which is available on-line.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595481","annotations":[{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Pelvic floor","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Anal canal","weight":0.716289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Pectinate line","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectinate_line"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Glossary of botanical terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_botanical_terms"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"}]}
