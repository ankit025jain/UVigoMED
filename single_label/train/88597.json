{"id":88597,"title":"Multilevel modeling of partnered relationship trajectories and relationship stability at 1, 2, and 5 years after traumatic brain injury in Norway.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to examine (a) predictors of partnered relationship probability trajectories and relationship stability across 1, 2, and 5 years after traumatic brain injury, and (b) influences on the slopes of these trajectories.Individuals (n = 105) from Norway with acute TBI were assessed during admission to an urban trauma center and again at 1, 2 and 5 years after injury. The outcome measures were partnered relationship status (partnered vs. single) at 1, 2 and 5 years post-injury investigated through multilevel modelling, and relationship stability (stable, unstable, and single) investigated through multinomial logistic regression. Independent variables were sex, age at injury, partnered relationship at injury, having dependent children, education, employment and occupation status at time of injury, acute Glasgow Coma Scale score, posttraumatic amnesia, and length of stay in hospital.Partnered relationship status at injury and the interaction of relationship status at injury by time, employment at injury and the interaction of TBI severity by time were significant predictors of participants' relationship trajectories. Having dependent children at the time of injury, higher education, and being in a blue collar occupation at time of injury were significant predictors of relationship stability.The identification of these influences on partnered relationship probability trajectories and stability could help clinicians and researchers develop and refine early interventions to reduce relationship dissolution in the first several years after brain injury.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820168","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic
