{"id":68092,"title":"Association of cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator gene mutation with negative outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection pregnancy in cases of congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens.","abstract":"To evaluate intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) results with regard to congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD) versus non-CBAVD obstruction, cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations versus non-CFTR mutations, and miscarriages or stillbirths versus live births per embryo transferred.Retrospective study with detailed chart review.Center for reproductive medicine.Nine hundred forty-five men with obstructive azoospermia.One thousand four hundred fourteen ICSI cycles classified as CBAVD versus non-CBAVD obstruction, CFTR mutations versus non-CFTR mutations, and miscarriages/stillbirths versus live births per embryo transferred.Frequency of CFTR mutations and rates of fertilization, good embryos, clinical pregnancy, miscarriages and stillbirths, ectopic pregnancy, and live births.CFTR mutations were more prevalent in men with CBAVD than in those with non-CBAVD obstruction. The rate of miscarriages and stillbirths per embryo transferred was higher in men with CBAVD than in those with non-CBAVD obstruction, whereas the rate of live births per embryo transferred was lower in men with CBAVD than in those with non-CBAVD obstruction. The rate of miscarriages and stillbirths per embryo transferred was higher in men with CFTR mutations than in those with non-CFTR mutations. The frequency of CFTR mutations was higher in patients who experienced miscarriages/stillbirths than in those with live births.The frequency of CFTR mutations was higher in cases of CBAVD versus non-CBAVD obstruction. Possibly as a result of CFTR mutations, patients with CBAVD had a significantly increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth and a reduced rate of live birth compared with patients with non-CBAVD.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559724","annotations":[{"name":"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Vas deferens","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.750234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Reproductive medicine","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_medicine"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Amniocentesis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis"},{"name":"Stillbirth","weight":0.663322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth"},{"name":"Azoospermia","weight":0.647398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoospermia"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Regulator gene","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_gene"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.214301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"},{"name":"Congenital absence of the vas deferens","weight":0.10897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_absence_of_the_vas_deferens"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","weight":0.0600434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
