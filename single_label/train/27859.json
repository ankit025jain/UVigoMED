{"id":27859,"title":"Psychopharmacology.","abstract":"Primary care providers (PCPs) are frequently responsible for the pharmacologic management of mood disorders, and the PCP is often an important member of the clinical team in the management of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Not only is a good understanding of psychopharmacology important for the effective treatment of psychiatric disease, it is also necessary for patient safety. Clinicians should understand the side effects and the medication interactions associated with psychotropic medications. This article reviews mechanisms of action, indications, dosing, side effects, medication interactions, and general management considerations for common medications used to treat psychiatric conditions encountered in the primary care setting.
