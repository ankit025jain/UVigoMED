{"id":43223,"title":"HPV infections among MSM in Shenzhen, China.","abstract":"An increasing incidence of anal cancer among men, especially men who have sex with men (MSM) suggests a need to better understand anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among this group.A cross-sectional study was conducted among MSM in Shenzhen, China. Blood was collected for HIV serological testing and syphilis serological screening, and anal swabs were collected for HPV genotyping. Difference of HPV prevalence between HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative MSM was assessed by chi-square test. Factors associated with anal canal HPV infection were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.A total of 408 MSM were recruited. HIV and HPV prevalence were 6.9% and 36.4%, respectively. HPV was detected in the anal canal in 71.4% of the HIV-positive MSM and in 33.8% of the HIV-negative MSM (P<0.001). Oncogenic types were seen more often in anal specimens of HIV-positive MSM than in specimens of HIV-negative MSM (P?=?0.001). The HPV genotypes detected most frequently were HPV06 (8.2%), HPV16 (7.2%), HPV11 (6.4%), HPV18 (4.7%), HPV58 (4.7%), and HPV52 (4.2%).In this study, HIV positive MSM had a higher burden of HPV infection, especially oncogenic HPV infection. HPV types 52 and 58 were as popular as those types designed for the currently available vaccine (HPV6, 11, 16, 18).","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24801331","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.899863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Anal cancer","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_cancer"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.47219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.450423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.177158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Shenzhen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Sailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor"},{"name":"HIV-positive people","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive_people"}]}
