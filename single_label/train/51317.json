{"id":51317,"title":"Fentanyl produces an anti-hyperalgesic effect through the suppression of sodium channels in mice with painful diabetic neuropathy.","abstract":"Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most frequent complications of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the anti-hyperalgesic mechanism of fentanyl in a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. The antinociceptive response was assessed by recording the latency in a tail-flick test. The tail-flick latency in diabetic mice was significantly shorter than that in non-diabetic mice. Fentanyl, at doses of 3 and 10 ?g/kg, s.c., produced a dose-dependent increase in the tail-flick latencies in diabetic mice. While fentanyl (3 ?g/kg, s.c.) did not produce a significant inhibition of the tail-flick response in non-diabetic mice, it significantly prolonged the tail-flick latency in diabetic mice to the same level as the baseline latency in non-diabetic mice. Although pretreatment with naloxone (3mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized fentanyl-induced antinociception in non-diabetic mice, it had no effect on the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl in diabetic mice. Pretreatment with either of the voltage-gated sodium channel openers fenvarelarte and veratridine practically abolished the antinociceptive effects of fentanyl in diabetic mice. However, neither fenvarelate nor veratridine affected the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl in non-diabetic mice. These results suggest that the anti-hyperalgesic effect of fentanyl is mediated through the blockade of sodium channels in diabetic mice, whereas opioid receptors mediate the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl in non-diabetic mice.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704555","annotations":[{"name":"Naloxone","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.829698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.404175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Veratridine","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veratridine"},{"name":"Opioid receptor","weight":0.288746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.217779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
