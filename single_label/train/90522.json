{"id":90522,"title":"[Differences in the changes of blood clotting state after initial trauma fractures and twice trauma fractures].","abstract":"To compare changes of blood clotting state after initial trauma fractures and twice trauma fractures, investigate the effect of fracture history to the state of the blood clotting after secondary trauma fractures.Thirty New Zealand rabbits were selected, aged 5-6 months, males and females unlimited, weighted 2.4-2.6 kg, non-pregnant. Postoperative model of initial trauma fractures was established, and then postoperative model after twice trauma fractures was built. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fiber fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer (DD) were detected by venous blood at 1 day and 5 days after surgery. Changes of indicators were compared between after twice fractures at the same time.Comparing with 1 day after the secondary trauma fracture and initial trauma fracture surgery, PT, APTT values showed no significant difference (P > 0.05), TT, FIB, DD values were increased, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); Comparing with 5 days after the secondary trauma fracture and initial trauma fracture surgery, PT values showed no significant difference (P < 0 .05), APTT, TT, FIB, DD values were increased, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05).Blood after the secondary trauma fractures is in hypercoagulable state after fracture surgery.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605746","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Thrombin time","weight":0.85291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin_time"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Partial thromboplastin time","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_thromboplastin_time"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.668329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.411975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.391329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Thromboplastin","weight":0.171955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboplastin"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Doctor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
