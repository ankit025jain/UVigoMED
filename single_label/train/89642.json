{"id":89642,"title":"Injuries to the ankle syndesmosis.","abstract":"? Despite being common, syndesmotic injuries are challenging to diagnose and treat.? Anatomic reduction of the ankle syndesmosis is critical for good clinical outcomes.? Intraoperative three-dimensional radiography and direct syndesmotic visualization can improve rates of anatomic reduction.? The so-called gold-standard syndesmotic screw fixation is being brought increasingly into question as new fixation techniques emerge.? Syndesmotic screw removal remains controversial, but may allow spontaneous correction of malreductions.
