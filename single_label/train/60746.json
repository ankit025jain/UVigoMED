{"id":60746,"title":"Tim-3 expression is increased on peripheral T cells from diffuse large B cell lymphoma.","abstract":"T cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) plays a critical role in immune tolerance by suppressing the activation and proliferation of T cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Tim-3 on the development of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A total of 40 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients and 30 healthy donors were recruited. Tim-3 expression on peripheral CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Data showed that expression of Tim-3 was significantly increased on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in DLBCL patients than in healthy controls (P?<?0.001 and P?<?0.001, respectively). Also, level of Tim-3 on CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells in patients (P?<?0.001). Further analyses revealed that patients with advanced tumor stages had elevated Tim-3 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to those with primary tumor stages. In addition, levels of Tim-3 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in DLBCL patients with bone marrow involvement or B symptoms. Our results suggest that Tim-3 is involved in the development of DLBCL.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833097","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Immune tolerance","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.450316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.407222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.364936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.335569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.314095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"B symptoms","weight":0.296559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_symptoms"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.231926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"}]}
