{"id":27959,"title":"Association between physical activity and substance use behaviors among high school students participating in the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.","abstract":"This study examined the relationship between physical activity, physical education class, and sports participation on the substance use practices of adolescents. Data was derived from the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey study of adolescent behaviors. The results of this study indicated that recreational physical activity, attending PE class, and participating in sports were independent protective factors for many cigarette use behaviors but not for smokeless tobacco use. Additionally, recreational physical activity and sports participation appears to be a protective factor for marijuana use among females but not males. On the other hand, recreational physical activity and sports participation appears to be a risk factor for alcohol use behaviors among males.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074297","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"School","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.619871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.514458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.447526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0703418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Youth Risk Behavior Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Risk_Behavior_Survey"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Independent school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
