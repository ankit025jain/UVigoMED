{"id":38079,"title":"Modeling family adaptation to fragile X syndrome.","abstract":"Using data from a survey of 1,099 families who have a child with Fragile X syndrome, we examined adaptation across 7 dimensions of family life: parenting knowledge, social support, social life, financial impact, well-being, quality of life, and overall impact. Results illustrate that although families report a high quality of life, they struggle with areas such as social support, social life, and parenting knowledge. Path analysis revealed that child and family factors play a role in adaptation, but family resources and social supports moderated their effect on quality of life, well-being, and overall impact. The interrelationship among multiple aspects of family life should be examined to improve family resiliency.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450320","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.64342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.589109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.344121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Parenting","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.220466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.155016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Fragile X syndrome","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Path analysis (statistics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_analysis_(statistics)"},{"name":"Psychological resilience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"}]}
