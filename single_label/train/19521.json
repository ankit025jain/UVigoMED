{"id":19521,"title":"Migration among individuals with leprosy: a population-based study in central Brazil.","abstract":"This study investigates social and clinical factors associated with migration among individuals affected by leprosy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among those newly diagnosed with leprosy (2006-2008), in 79 endemic municipalities in the state of Tocantins, Brazil (N = 1,074). In total, 76.2% were born in a municipality different from their current residence. In the five years before diagnosis 16.7% migrated, and 3.6% migrated after leprosy diagnosis. Findings reflect aspects associated with historical rural-urban population movement in Brazil. Indicators of poverty were prominent among before-diagnosis migrants but not after-diagnosis migrants. Migration after diagnosis was associated with prior migration. The association of multibacillary leprosy with migration indicates healthcare access may be an obstacle to early diagnosis among before-diagnosis migrants, which may also be related to the high mobility of this group.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714939","annotations":[{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.647624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.623912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.571009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.534277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"History","weight":0.502293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.353355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Tocantins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocantins"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Social mobility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility"}]}
