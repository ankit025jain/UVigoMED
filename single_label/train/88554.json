{"id":88554,"title":"Nintendo Wii related Achilles tendon rupture: first reported case and literature review of motion sensing video game injuries.","abstract":"Achilles tendon ruptures tend to occur more commonly in healthy men between the ages of 30 and 50 years who have had no previous injury or problem reported in the affected leg. The injury is usually due to sudden forced plantar flexion of the foot, unexpected dorsiflexion of the foot and violent dorsiflexion of a plantar flexed foot, all of which occur during high impact activities. We present the first reported case of interactive activity with Nintendo Wii games that have resulted in Achilles tendon rupture in a 46-year-old man. There have been no previous reports of Achilles tendon rupture with Nintendo Wii usage; it is a relatively uncommon mode of injury and is rare in terms of epidemiology of motion sensing video game injuries.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827648","annotations":[{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.760569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.616634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Plantarflexion","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantarflexion"},{"name":"Dorsiflexion","weight":0.405063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsiflexion"},{"name":"Wii","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.33271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.328331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.296916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Video game","weight":0.286295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.141444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Achilles tendon rupture","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Nintendo","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"List of Wii games","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wii_games"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Tendinosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinosis"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"},{"name":"Motion detection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_detection"}]}
