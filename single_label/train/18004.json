{"id":18004,"title":"Three new phenylpropanoids from the roots of Piper taiwanense and their inhibitory activities on platelet aggregation and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abstract":"Bioassay-guided fractionation of the active AcOEt-soluble fraction from the roots of Piper taiwanense has led to the isolation of two new phenylpropanoids, taiwanensols A and B (1 and 2, resp.), a new natural product, taiwanensol C (3), and 3-acetoxy-4-hydroxy-1-allylbenzene (4). The compounds were obtained as two isomer mixtures (1/2 and 3/4, resp.). Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses, including 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and by the comparison of their NMR data with those of related compounds. Compounds 1-4 were evaluated for their antiplatelet and antitubercular activities. The mixtures 1/2 and 3/4 showed potent inhibitory activities against platelet aggregation induced by collagen, with IC50 values of 35.2 and 8.8 ?M, respectively. In addition, 1/2 and 3/4 showed antitubercular activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, with MIC values of 30.0 and 48.0 ?g/ml, respectively.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827689","annotations":[{"name":"Isomer","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.794885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.666355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.418067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.365191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.140731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.055809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Phenylpropanoid","weight":0.0518106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpropanoid"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Phenylpropene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpropene"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Root (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Malaysian Indian Congress","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Indian_Congress"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Acetoxy group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetoxy_group"},{"name":"Norwegian national road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_national_road"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"}]}
