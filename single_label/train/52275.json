{"id":52275,"title":"Incretin therapy and heart failure.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is widely prevalent and a critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease that increases both morbidity and mortality. Recently, new therapies based on the actions of the incretin hormones have become widely used, offering advantages over conventional treatments by limiting hypoglycemia and achieving glycemic control. Moreover, many experimental studies have suggested that GLP-1 and related drugs exert cardioprotective effects on atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction both in vitro and in vivo. However, there is thus far little clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of incretin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the effects of GLP-1-related therapy on cardiac function from the bench to the bed, with a discussion of possible underlying mechanisms.??","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614493","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.638165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.476847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Incretin","weight":0.125636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incretin"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.108754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0254718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Guadeloupe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe"},{"name":"Judge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge"}]}
