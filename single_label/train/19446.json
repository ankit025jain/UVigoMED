{"id":19446,"title":"Reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease 3 years after the introduction of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine in the Oxfordshire region of England.","abstract":"The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV7) vaccine's impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is well described, but few reports exist on the additional impact of the 13-valent vaccine (PCV13).We calculated the IPD incidence across all ages in a surveillance project following implementation of PCV7 (in September 2006) and PCV13 (in April 2010) in children aged <2 years (11 hospitals; 4935 cases).The overall incidence decreased from 10 cases/100 000 persons per year in 1996-1997 to 8 cases/100 000 persons per year in 2007-2008 and 7 cases/100 000 in 2012-2013. Declines were greater in children aged <2 years (from 37 cases/100 000 in 1996-1997 to 29 and 14 cases/100 000 in 2007-2008 and 2012-2013, respectively). The incidence of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes decreased in all ages after PCV7 introduction (P < .001), whereas the incidence of IPD due to the additional 6 serotypes in PCV13 and to nonvaccine types (NVTs) increased in children aged ?2 years (P < .001 for both comparisons). The incidence of IPD due to the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13 declined significantly after PCV13 introduction in all ages (P ? .01), and the incidence of IPD due to NVTs declined significantly in children aged ?2 years (P = .003). In 2011-2013, the overall incidences of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes, the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13, and NVTs were 0.3, 2.8, and 4.4 cases/100 000; the incidences among children aged <2 years were 0.9, 2.4, and 10.8 cases/100 000, respectively.The annual incidence of IPD due to vaccine serotypes (1-3 cases/100 000) among children aged <2 years and nontarget groups demonstrates the success of PCV7 and PCV13. A substantially higher incidence of IPD due to NVTs indicates the importance of ongoing surveillance and extension of vaccine polyvalency.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719477","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.432482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.338059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"England","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.214493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.170727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0386915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Polytonality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonality"},{"name":"Oxfordshire","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Regions of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_England"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"}]}
