{"id":80967,"title":"[Clinical observation on abnormal glucose metabolism of cirrhosis of different classified child-pugh in schistosomiasis patients].","abstract":"To study the abnormal glucose metabolism of cirrhosis of different classified Child-Pugh in schistosomiasis patients.A total of 90 schistosomiasis patients with different classified Child-Pugh cirrhosis were investigated for their fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour blood glucose (2hBG), 3-hour blood glucose (3hBG), free insulin (FINS), insulin release index (IRI) and insulin resistance index (IRI).With the increasing of classified Child-Pugh, the abnormal glucose metabolism of the 90 schistosome cirrhosis patients aggravates, but most of FBS was normal or increases slightly. There was only one female patient in 7 patients with diabetes mellitus of liver.The ratio of abnormal glucose metabolism of schistosomiasis cirrhosis patients is less, and most of them are younger males.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490383","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.872991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.70715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.53907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.422041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.355019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.310055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.301218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"}]}
