{"id":51204,"title":"miR-22 inhibits proliferation and invasion in estrogen receptor ?-positive endometrial endometrioid carcinomas cells.","abstract":"Endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (EECs) account for >80% of endometrial carcinomas (ECs). Continuous stimulation of the endometrium by estrogen is a risk factor for the tumorigenesis of estrogen receptor (ER) ?-positive EEC. MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has been reported to be implicated in the regulation of various types of cancer and directly targets ER?. However, an exact regulatory mechanism between miR-22 and ER? in EEC has yet to be investigated. To the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated for the first time that the expression of miR-22 was significantly downregulated in ER?-positive EEC tissues and cell lines, RL95-2 and Ishikawa, when compared with that in normal endometrium and ER?-negative EEC samples. This indicated that miR-22 may be important in ER?-positive EEC, possibly through an estrogen-dependent mechanism. miR-22 mimics were then transfected into RL95-2 and Ishikawa cells, respectively, and revealed that the introduction of miR-22 markedly downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of ER?. Further investigation demonstrated that miR-22 was able to effectively reverse 17?-estradiol (E2)?induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and invasion of ER?-positive RL95-2 and Ishikawa cells, at least partially through inhibiting the expression of Cyclin D1 as well as the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, the present study, to the best of our knowledge, was the first to reveal an inhibitory role of miR-22 in ER?-positive EEC tissues and cells, indicating that miR-22 may be a novel candidate for the endocrine therapy of ER?-positive EEC.
