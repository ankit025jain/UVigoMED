{"id":54247,"title":"A short message service (SMS) intervention to prevent diabetes in Chinese professional drivers with pre-diabetes: a pilot single-blinded randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To determine the efficacy of delivering short-message service (SMS) to provide diabetes-related information in reducing the risk of developing diabetes in Chinese professional drivers with pre-diabetes.A pilot single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hong Kong between 05/2009 and 04/2012. Professional drivers with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were randomly allocated to either a SMS group receiving messages comprising knowledge and lifestyle modification on diabetes or to a control group with usual care. Primary outcomes were the incidence rate of diabetes mellitus over 12 and 24 months period.Fifty-four, out of 104 professional drivers recruited, were randomly allocated to intervention group. Fewer subjects developed diabetes at 12 months in intervention group (5.56%) compared to control group (16.00%). Relative risk (RR) of diabetes onset was 0.35 (95%CI: 0.10–1.24) and the number needed to treat (NNT) for preventing one diabetes was 9.57. At 24 months, RR increased to 0.62 (95%CI: 0.24–1.61) with a NNT of 10.58. Logistic regression showed a significant odds ratio of 0.04 (P = 0.021) for intervention group compared to control group at 12-month follow-up for completers and a non-significant odds ratio of 0.34 (P = 0.303) at 24-month follow-up.The SMS program proved to have potential to reduce the risk of developing diabetes at 12 months but additional measures should be integrated to prevent or delay disease progression.","date":"2014-01-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466598","annotations":[{"name":"Number needed to treat","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_treat"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.781175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.632213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.561357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.405809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"China","weight":0.382518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.29899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.212081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"SMS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
