{"id":13337,"title":"Variations of some physiological and immunological parameters in Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii, Brandt, 1869) subjected to an acute stressor.","abstract":"This study was carried out to investigate the effect of an acute stressor on the variation of some physiological and immunological parameters of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) juveniles. Fish, reared in 3 tanks for 10 weeks, were used for this study. The acute stress of fish consisted of 2 min of air exposure stress. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose, and lactate as well as lysozyme activity in plasma were measured before stress and 1 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr, 9 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr after stress. The plasma cortisol significantly increased in the highest level 1 hr after stress, yet it gradually declined after 3 hr. The glucose significantly increased only 1 hr after stress. There was no significant difference between plasma lactate prestress and poststress. Moreover, lysozyme activity was enhanced by stress, thus reaching the highest level 9 hr after stress. The results of this study indicate that Siberian sturgeon not only have a rapid response to acute stress, but also a great capacity for recovery from stress, thus returning physiological parameters to prestress levels after 6 hr.
