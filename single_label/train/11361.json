{"id":11361,"title":"The precision and accuracy of Nellcor and Masimo oximeters at low oxygen saturations (70%) in newborn lambs.","abstract":"Administration of oxygen in the delivery room is informed by oxygen saturation (SpO?). An oxygen saturation range of 60%-70% is the threshold for administering oxygen in the first minutes after birth. The accuracy of newer generation oximeters to measure SpO? has not been compared against the 'gold standard', direct arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO?) when SaO? is low. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and precision of Nellcor and Masimo oximeters to measure SpO? when SaO? <70%.Prospective observational study in ventilated anaesthetised newborn lambs with an indwelling carotid artery catheter. Ventilation was adjusted to achieve hypoxaemia. Nellcor (Oxi-Max 600 with Max-N sensor) and Masimo (Rad 4 with low noise optical probe (LNOP) sensor) sensors were applied to the right forelimb (preductal). An arterial blood sample was collected at 1-5 min intervals when the animal was hypoxic. The displayed SpO? was recorded. We used Bland-Altman analysis to determine precision and accuracy of each oximeter when SaO? <70%.17 lambs were studied, 165 measurements were obtained, 123 were SaO? <70%. The mean difference (±1.96 SD) Nellcor SpO?-SaO? when SaO? <70% was 17% (-12% to 46%). The mean difference (±1.96 SD) Masimo SpO?-SaO? when SaO2 <70% was 13% (-19% to 45%).At SaO?<70%, both monitors overestimated oxygen saturation (SpO?) compared with the gold standard. Both oximeters were equally inaccurate when SaO? was low.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596406","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pulse oximeter","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximeter"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.697735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.659758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Nellcor","weight":0.643667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellcor"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.385129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.280056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.196515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.160236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0961423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Electric generator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
