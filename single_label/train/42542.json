{"id":42542,"title":"[Joint application of computed tomography and laparoscopy in preoperative staging of gastric cancer].","abstract":"To compare the accuracy of computer tomography (CT) plus diagnostic laparoscopy in preoperative staging of potentially resectable gastric cancer.A total of 194 gastric cancer patients underwent combined CT and laparoscopic staging. Then the results were compared with those of pathologic TNM staging.Comparing with pathologic TNM stage, the T staging accuracy of CT was lower than that of laparoscopy (72.7% vs 89.6%, ?² = 7.844, P = 0.005), the N staging accuracies of CT and laparoscopy were 55.6% and 70.1% (?² = 4.329, P = 0.037) and the M staging accuracies 90.7% and 97.9% respectively (?² = 4.722, P = 0.030). The diagnostic laparoscopy uncovered 14 patients with peritoneal metastases.The value of CT is limited in preoperative staging of gastric cancer.However its accuracy may be enhanced by laparoscopy through detecting more peritoneal metastasis.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844963","annotations":[{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.640491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.581758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.41409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"844","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/844"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
