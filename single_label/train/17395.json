{"id":17395,"title":"Mycobacterial infection of breast prosthesis--a conservative treatment: a case report.","abstract":"Bacterial infection is a well-known risk of breast implant surgery. It is typically caused by bacterial skin flora, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase negative staphylococci. There have been infrequent reports of breast implant infection caused by the atypical mycobacteria, of which Mycobacterium canariasense not yet reported in the literature.This report summarizes the case of a female patient who underwent mastectomy followed by bilateral breast augmentation and presented approximately three years later with clinical evidence of infected breast prosthesis by Mycobacterium canariasense. One year after thoroughly follow-up, appropriate antibiotherapy and the change of the infected prosthesis, the patient presented no signs of reinfection.Our case demonstrates that Mycobacterium canariasense should be considered as a new potential cause of infected breast prosthesis.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885792","annotations":[{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.923416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.82137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.812954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.785026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.537583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Skin flora","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.492698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.294278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Coagulase","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulase"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontuberculous_mycobacteria"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
