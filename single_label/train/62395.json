{"id":62395,"title":"Prognostic factors and outcomes of adults with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","abstract":"To describe the prognostic factors and outcomes of adults with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare disorder caused by pathologic activation of the immune system.The study population consisted of a consecutive cohort of adult (age ?18 years) patients treated at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2011, in whom a diagnosis of HLH was suspected and subsequently confirmed by retrospective review using the HLH-04 diagnostic criteria.Of 250 adult patients suspected of having HLH, 62 met the HLH-04 diagnostic criteria and were included in the final analysis. The median age was 49 years (range, 18-87 years), and 42 (68%) were male. The underlying cause of HLH was malignant tumor in 32 patients (52%), infection in 21 patients (34%), autoimmune disorder in 5 patients (8%), and idiopathic disease in 4 patients (6%). After a median follow-up of 42 months, 41 patients (66%) had died. The median overall survival of the entire cohort was 2.1 months. The median overall survival of patients with tumor-associated HLH was 1.4 months compared with 22.8 months for patients with non-tumor-associated HLH (P=.01). The presence of a malignant tumor and hypoalbuminemia were significant predictors of inferior survival on multivariate analysis.In this large series of adults with secondary HLH treated at a single tertiary care center, patients with low serum albumin levels and tumor-associated HLH had a markedly worse survival. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis remains elusive and challenging to clinicians who must maintain a high index of suspicion. The recent discovery of several novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities may improve outcomes of adult patients with HLH.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
