{"id":10981,"title":"Isovolemic hemodilution with glutaraldehyde-polymerized human placenta hemoglobin (PolyPHb) attenuated rat liver ischemia/reperfusion injury.","abstract":"This study was to investigate whether glutaraldehyde-polymerized human placenta hemoglobin (PolyPHb) could attenuate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced liver injury. Isovolemic hemodilution of SD rats was performed by exchanging 15% total blood volume with PolyPHb. I/R was induced by left liver lobes pedicle cross-clamping for 60 min and reperfusion for 2 h. Blood pressure moderately elevated after PolyPHb infusion and returned to basal level within 10 min. The hepatic histopathological damage and the activities of liver injury markers were reduced by PolyPHb. The TUNEL staining and caspase assay indicated hepatic apoptosis was also inhibited. Therefore, our findings suggest PolyPHb can reduce liver I/R injury.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621076","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.538936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.519897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.389099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.295549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.267722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.148784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0825297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Placentophagy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placentophagy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"}]}
