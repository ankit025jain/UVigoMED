{"id":67878,"title":"Fast globally optimal segmentation of 3D prostate MRI with axial symmetry prior.","abstract":"We propose a novel global optimization approach to segmenting a given 3D prostate T2w magnetic resonance (MR) image, which enforces the inherent axial symmetry of the prostate shape and simultaneously performs a sequence of 2D axial slice-wise segmentations with a global 3D coherence prior. We show that the proposed challenging combinatorial optimization problem can be solved globally and exactly by means of convex relaxation. With this regard, we introduce a novel coupled continuous max-flow model, which is dual to the studied convex relaxed optimization formulation and leads to an efficient multiplier augmented algorithm based on the modern convex optimization theory. Moreover, the new continuous max-flow based algorithm was implemented on GPUs to achieve a substantial improvement in computation. Experimental results using public and in-house datasets demonstrate great advantages of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579141","annotations":[{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.588368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Combinatorics","weight":0.526765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics"},{"name":"Convex set","weight":0.411142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set"},{"name":"Combinatorial optimization","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.353664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.261876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.229403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.165412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Optimization problem","weight":0.13635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem"},{"name":"Graphics processing unit","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"},{"name":"Computation","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation"},{"name":"Global optimization","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimization"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0970692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Convex optimization","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Augmented reality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality"},{"name":"Algorithmic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency"},{"name":"Duality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Axial symmetry","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_symmetry"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Path integral formulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
