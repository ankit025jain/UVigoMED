{"id":6927,"title":"[Advances in reverse genetics-based vaccines of foot and mouth disease].","abstract":"Reverse-genetic engineering of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) can improve the productivity, antigen matching, antigen stability, immune response ability, and biological safety of vaccines, so vaccine candidates with anticipated biological characteristics can be promptly achieved. Negative influence in taming of virulent strains can also be decreased or avoided. Reverse genetics not only make up for deficiencies like limitation of viral nature, low success rate, and time and energy consuming, but also realize more active designing of vaccines. Therefore, reverse genetics is significant in improving integral quality and efficiency of vaccines. In this review, we use FMDV vaccines as an example to summarize improvement in biological characteristics of virulent strains and provide a reference for related researches.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923178","annotations":[{"name":"Reverse genetics","weight":0.822888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_genetics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.668526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.405407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.315483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Process design (chemical engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_(chemical_engineering)"},{"name":"Stability theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"}]}
