{"id":69625,"title":"[Yiqi Zhujing granule for idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia: a clinical study].","abstract":"To assess the efficacy of Yiqi Zhujing Particle in the treatment of idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia.We equally randomized 78 patients with idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia to a control group and a Yiqi Zhujing group, the former treated with oral medication of zinc gluconate liquid (10 ml, bid) and vitamin E (100 mg, bid), and the latter given Yiqi Zhujing Granule (1 packet, bid) in addition, both for 3 months. We compared the semen parameters and biochemical indexes of the seminal plasma obtained before and after medication between the two groups of patients.After 3 months of treatment, remarkable improvement was observed in the percentage of progressively motile sperm and sperm viability in the control group (P < 0.05) as well as in the total sperm count, sperm concentration, percentage of progressively motile sperm, and sperm viability in the Yiqi Zhujing group (P < 0.05). The total sperm count, sperm concentration, percentage of progressively motile sperm, and sperm viability were even more significantly improved in the Yiqi Zhujing than in the control group (P < 0.05). Besides, both groups showed different degrees of improvement in the biochemical indexes of the seminal plasma, and the Yiqi Zhujing group exhibited even more significant improvement in seminal plasma zinc, alpha-glucoside enzyme, seminal plasma fructose, and acid phosphatase than the control (P < 0.05). The improvement of sperm concentration was correlated positively with the change of seminal plasma zinc (r = 0.201, P < 0.05) but negatively with that of seminal plasma fructose after treatment (r = -0.136, P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the alpha-glucoside enzyme level and sperm viability (r = 0.314, P < 0.05).Yiqi Zhujing Particle is effective for idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia by significantly improving the total sperm count, sperm concentration, percentage of progressively motile sperm, sperm viability, seminal plasma zinc, seminal plasma fructose, and alpha-glucoside enzyme.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432627","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Fructose","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.708148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.6643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.601702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.562303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.560402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.316259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.269742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.190881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.186427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Gluconic acid","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconic_acid"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Zinc gluconate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_gluconate"},{"name":"Acid phosphatase","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_phosphatase"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"}]}
