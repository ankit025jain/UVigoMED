{"id":85567,"title":"[Non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness and polymorphysm of xenobiotics biotransformation GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes under neutrophilic bronchial asthma in children].","abstract":"With a view to study the effect of genes GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion on the non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children with neutrophilic bronchial asthma (BA) 46 school age children having neutrophilic BA (1st clinical group) and their 48 coevals with eosinophilic phenotype of the disease (2nd clinical group) were subjected to a complex examination at the pulmo-allergologic department of the regional child clinical hospital of Chernivtsi. The study proved that genotype T1+M1del was more frequently registered in patients with the neutrophilic phenotype of the disease, and genotype T1delM1del was equifrequent in patients with different types of the inflammation of the respiratory ways. In patients with neutrophilic BA and deletion polymorphism of genes GSTT1 and GSTM1, there was a tendency to decreasing of the bronchial lability index through the decrease of bronchodilation, and bronchial response to histamine occurred to be higher than in children with the absence of polymorphism of the referred genes of the xenobiotics biotransformation system.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908960","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.681035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bronchodilator","weight":0.645207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchodilator"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.476153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.272202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchial_hyperresponsiveness"},{"name":"Xenobiotic","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Chernivtsi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernivtsi"},{"name":"Eosinophilic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic"},{"name":"Biotransformation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotransformation"},{"name":"Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_S-transferase_Mu_1"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Nd (digraph)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nd_(digraph)"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Astra 1M","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_1M"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"},{"name":"Pseudobulbar affect","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect"}]}
