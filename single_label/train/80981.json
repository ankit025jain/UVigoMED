{"id":80981,"title":"[Cost-effectiveness of schistosomiasis comprehensive control in Lushan County from 2007 to 2012].","abstract":"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive control strategy which mainly controls the schistosomiasis infection source in Lushan County from 2007 to 2012.The data of the schistosomiasis endemic, Oncomelania hupensis snail status, control technology, and funding were collected and analyzed statistically in the endemic villages of Lushan County from 2007 to 2012.The schistosome infection rate of the residents decreased from 0.04% in 2007 to 0 in 2012. The numbers of advanced schistosomiasis patients decreased from 128 in 2007 to 121 in 2012. No acute schistosomiasis patients were found. The average density of living snails decreased from 0.06 snial/0.1 m2 to 0.05 snail/0.1 m2, with the decreased rate of 16.67%, and no schistosome infected snails were found. However, the snail area increased from 15.84 hm2 in 2007 to 52.12 hm2 in 2012, with the rise rate of 229.04%. The year per capita was 200.48 yuan, the cost of the infection rate decreasing by 1% was 949,900 yuan, and the cost of living snail density decreasing by 1% was 5,698,200 yuan.The cost-effectiveness of comprehensive control strategy which mainly controls the schistosomiasis infection source is relatively good in Lushan County from 2007 to 2012.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490367","annotations":[{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.112841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Per capita","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"698","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/698"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Cost of living","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Renminbi","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi"}]}
