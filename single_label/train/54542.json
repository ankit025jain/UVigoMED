{"id":54542,"title":"Association between fragile X premutation and premature ovarian failure: a case-control study and meta-analysis.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between FMR1 premutation and premature ovarian failure (POF) patients in Indian population, and a meta-analysis of published results was undertaken to clarify whether FMR1 premutation consistently contributed to the susceptibility.A total of 289 POF samples and 360 control samples were included in the study. Repeat variation was checked using GeneScan technique. Results were analyzed with GeneMapper software. Meta-analysis was performed using the Open Meta-Analyst and STATA 12.0 software. The crude odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was computed to assess the strength of the associations.The assayed case and control population showed 29 different CGG repeat sizes (alleles), ranging from 7 to 40. Within this population, we found that the CGG repeat length polymorphisms were within the normal range of 6-55 in both patients as well as control samples. Eleven case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 1,313 POF cases and 3,132 control subjects. Our meta-analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in the incidence of FMR1 premutation between POF cases and control subjects with p value <0.001 (OR 5.41; 95 % CI 2.53, 11.61).We found no significant association between FMR1 CGG repeat premutation and POF in Indian population. However, the meta-analysis showed an increased risk of POF associated with a premutation, especially among populations from European descent. Further functional research should be performed to explain the inconsistent results in different ethnicities and POF susceptibility.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452737","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.575428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.303213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"FMR1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMR1"},{"name":"Premature ovarian failure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ovarian_failure"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Fragile X syndrome","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"655","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/655"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Pakistan Ordnance Factories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Ordnance_Factories"},{"name":"Xbox 360","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
