{"id":20839,"title":"Daptomycin activity tested against 164457 bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients: summary of 8 years of a Worldwide Surveillance Programme (2005-2012).","abstract":"We report the results of 8 years (2005-2012) of the Daptomycin Surveillance Programme Worldwide. Consecutive non-duplicate bacterial isolates (prevalence design) were collected from patients with documented infections in 410 medical centres and were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 164457 Gram-positive isolates were evaluated, including 97542 Staphylococcus aureus, 21413 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 29619 enterococci and 15883 ?-haemolytic streptococci. The prevalence of daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates was extremely low for all species in all geographic regions. Overall, the highest occurrence of non-susceptible isolates was observed among CoNS (0.19%), followed by Enterococcus faecium (0.18%), S. aureus (0.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.02%) and ?-haemolytic streptococci (0.00%). Moreover, no trend towards increased daptomycin resistance (non-susceptibility) was observed for any species in any geographic region during the study interval. Against S. aureus, the daptomycin MIC(50/90) was 0.25/0.5 mg/L in all geographic regions (99.95% susceptible overall). Only 53 daptomycin-non-susceptible S. aureus isolates were observed and the vast majority (49; 92.5%) had a daptomycin MIC value only 1 log(2) dilution above the published susceptible breakpoint. Daptomycin was also active against CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 99.81% susceptible), E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/L; 99.98% susceptible), E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 2/4 mg/L; 99.82% susceptible) including vancomycin-non-susceptible isolates (4521 isolates; MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/L; 99.76% susceptible), and ?-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), ?0.06/0.25 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible). In conclusion, daptomycin has remained very active against indicated species worldwide, and no significant year-to-year or regional variation in daptomycin activity has been detected.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636430","annotations":[{"name":"Daptomycin","weight":0.955586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daptomycin"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.835226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.795537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.711652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.47494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecium","weight":0.350458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecium"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Breakpoint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0257266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Regional variation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_variation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"}]}
