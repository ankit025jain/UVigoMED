{"id":92051,"title":"Ligament-induced sacral fractures of the pelvis are possible.","abstract":"Pelvic ring stability is maintained passively by both the osseous and the ligamentous apparatus. Therapeutic approaches focus mainly on fracture patterns, so ligaments are often neglected. When they rupture along with the bone after pelvic ring fractures, disrupting stability, ligaments need to be considered during reconstruction and rehabilitation. Our aim was to determine the influence of ligaments on open-book injury using two experimental models with body donors. Mechanisms of bone avulsion related to open-book injury were investigated. Open-book injuries were induced in human pelves and subsequently investigated by anatomical dissection and endoscopy. The findings were compared to CT and MRI scans of open-book injuries. Relevant structures were further analyzed using plastinated cross-sections of the posterior pelvic ring. A fragment of the distal sacrum was observed, related to open-book injury. Two ligaments were found to be responsible for this avulsion phenomenon: the caudal portion of the anterior sacroiliac ligament and another ligament running along the ventral surface of the third sacral vertebra. The sacral fragment remained attached to the coxal bone by this second ligament after open-book injury. These results were validated using plastination and the structures were identified. Pelvic ligaments are probably involved in sacral avulsion caused by lateral traction. Therefore, ligaments should to be taken into account in diagnosis of open-book injury and subsequent therapy.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452928","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.783604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.743467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Sacroiliac joint","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.683758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anterior sacroiliac ligament","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_sacroiliac_ligament"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.674063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.659143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.655992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Avulsion fracture","weight":0.614436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.572668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ventral","weight":0.50478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Caudal","weight":0.219182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Plastination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastination"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
