{"id":53807,"title":"The foregut theory as a possible mechanism of action for the remission of type 2 diabetes in low body mass index patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","abstract":"The question of whether pure metabolic surgery could be used in nonobese patients with type 2 diabetes has been considered. The objective of this study was to assess the comparative effects of the Billroth I (BI) and Billroth II (BII) reconstruction methods on remission of type 2 diabetes in nonobese patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy for cancer.The charts of 404 patients who underwent radical subtotal gastrectomy for cancer between January 2008 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. From these patients, 49 with type 2 diabetes were included in this study. Diabetes remission rates, the percentage change in fasting plasma glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin levels, body mass index, and fasting total cholesterol levels at 2 years were observed. Outcomes were compared using propensity scores and inverse probability-weighting adjustment that reduced treatment-selection bias. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression models were assessed.The 2-year diabetes remission rate for the 23 patients who underwent BI reconstruction was 39.1%, compared with 50.0% for the 26 patients who underwent BII reconstruction. At 2 years, the BII group showed lower glycated hemoglobin levels (BI, 6.4%; BII, 6.1%; P = .003) and had greater percent reductions in their average glycated hemoglobin levels from baseline (BI,-11.6%; BII,-14.5%; P = .043). BII reconstruction was significantly associated with an increased diabetes remission rate (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-9.83) in covariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis.These propensity score-adjusted analyses of patients who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy indicated that BII reconstruction was associated with increased diabetes remission compared with BI reconstruction during the 2-year follow-up period. This study suggests the possibility of employing the surgical duodenal switch for the treatment of nonobese type 2 diabetes patients.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System
