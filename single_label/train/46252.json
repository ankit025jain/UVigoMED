{"id":46252,"title":"[The experience with the application of non-medicamental methods for the treatment of the patients presenting with gastroesophageal reflux disease].","abstract":"The present study was designed to estimate the effectiveness of structural resonance electromagnetic therapy, acupuncture, and DMW therapy applied for the treatment of the patients presenting with gastroesophageal reflux disease. It was shown that acupuncture produced beneficial effect on the functional state of oesophagus and neurohumoral regulation of the lower oesophageal sphincter; moreover, it suppressed the acid-producing activity of the stomach. Structural resonance electromagnetic therapy, acupuncture, and DMW therapy decreased the level of vasoactive intestinal peptide in blood sera of the patients with this condition. These findings give reason to recommend acupuncture using corporal points (in the form of monotherapy in combination with a diet) to the patients presenting with gastroesophageal reflux disease and grade 0 and 1 oesophagitis (Savary-Miller classification). Structural resonance electromagnetic therapy (both alone and in combination with iodine-bromine baths) may be used to treat patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and grade 0 oesophagitis. Such patients may be just as well managed using DMW therapy in combination with iodine-bromine baths. Patients presenting with grade 1 oesophagitisshoud be treated with the use of the above physical factors in combination with medicamental therapy.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640654","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.637041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.610423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.527379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.205945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.117762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Vasoactive intestinal peptide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide"},{"name":"Electromagnetic therapy (alternative medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_therapy_(alternative_medicine)"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"First grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Vasoactive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Corporal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Buzz cut","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_cut"},{"name":"DMW Motorcycles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMW_Motorcycles"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"}]}
