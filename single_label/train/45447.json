{"id":45447,"title":"A population-based evaluation of readmissions after first hospitalization for acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the burden and pattern of pancreatitis-related readmissions after index hospitalization for acute pancreatitis (AP).We identified all unique white or black Allegheny County residents with first hospital admission for AP from 1996 to 2005 using the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council data set. The final study population consisted of patients (n = 6010) who survived index admission and had follow-up data on readmissions. The etiology was determined using associated diagnosis codes. We analyzed pancreatitis-related readmissions until the third quarter of 2007 (median follow-up time, 39 months).The absolute risk and total burden of readmissions were 21.9% and 2947 for primary AP, respectively, 5.8% and 812 for primary chronic pancreatitis (CP), respectively, and 32.3% and 6612 for any pancreatitis diagnosis, respectively. Patients with alcohol etiology (etiology on index admission in 20.3%; responsible for 41.6%-50.4% readmissions) and subsequent diagnosis of CP (any CP diagnosis, 12.8%; responsible for 73% readmissions) accounted for a disproportionately higher fraction of readmissions. Readmission risk decreased with increasing age. A small fraction of patients accounted for most readmissions.Readmission after AP is influenced by demographics, etiology, and subsequent CP diagnosis. Future studies should focus on understanding the factors driving readmissions in high-risk individuals to develop strategies for reducing pancreatitis-related readmissions and health care costs.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681876","annotations":[{"name":"Health
