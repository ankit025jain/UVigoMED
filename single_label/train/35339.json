{"id":35339,"title":"TLR2 and TLR4 expression in atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and psoriasis.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 on keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis by PCR and by immunohistochemistry including confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy revealed a granular intra-cellular expression pattern for TLR 2 and a homogenous intra-cellular expression pattern for TLR 4 in normal and diseased skin. TLR 2 was constitutively expressed in the suprabasal layers in normal skin, but limited to the basal epidermis in diseased skin. TLR 4 expression was concentrated to the basal layers in normal skin, whereas it was pronounced in upper layers in diseased skin. The shift in the TLR expression may be related to the disturbed skin barrier and a need for enhanced immune surveillance because of invading microbes. Also, there must be a balance between sufficient immune response and overstimulation.
