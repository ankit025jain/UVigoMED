{"id":78659,"title":"[Universal newborn hearing screening : Definition of uniform parameters by the Association of German Hearing Screening Centers as a requirement for nationwide evaluation with valid results].","abstract":"Since 2009, all newborns in Germany have been entitled to universal neonatal hearing screening (UNHS). UNHS with tracking of test results leads to earlier detection of hearing disorders. The Association of German Hearing Screening Centers (Verband Deutscher HÃ¶rscreening-Zentralen, VDHZ) was founded to promote nationwide tracking, validity and quality control of UNHS results.A comparable data structure in the different screening centers, with uniform definitions of primary parameters is essential for the nationwide evaluation of UNHS results. To address the question of whether a data structure with comparable definitions already exists or still has to be created, the existing structures and primary parameter definitions in the hearing screening centers should be investigated and compared.A survey was conducted in all hearing screening centers to assess how data on the primary UNHS parameters defined in pediatric guidelines was gathered. In the case of discrepancies, uniform definitions were created. Finally, the practicability of these definitions was evaluated.Due to differing definitions of primary parameters, some of the data were not comparable between the individual centers. Therefore, uniform definitions were created in a consensus process. In the centers, the screening method, the two-step first screening and the result of the first screening now correspond to these uniform definitions. Other parameters, e.g. the total number of newborns, still vary widely, rendering the comparison of screening rates almost impossible.Valid evaluation of UNHS not only requires nationwide establishment of hearing screening centers, but also unified data structures and parameter definitions.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610085","annotations":[{"name":"Germany","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.582994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data structure","weight":0.49601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.423636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.330555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.251829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.154639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Universal Studios","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios"},{"name":"The Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Universality (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"}]}
