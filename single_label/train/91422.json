{"id":91422,"title":"[Analysis of projects received and funded in fields of emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery from National Natural Science Foundation of China during 2010-2013].","abstract":"To summarized the projects received and funded in the fields of emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) during 2010-2013, put forward the thinking and perspective of this future trend in these fields.The number of the funded project and total funding in the fields of emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery from NSFC during 2010-2013 had been statistical analyzed, in the meantime, the overview situation of various branches in basic research and further preliminary analysis the research frontier and hot issues have been analyzed.(1) The number of funded project were 581 in H15 of NSFC during 2010-2013, total funding reached to 277.13 million RMB, including 117 projects in H1511 (emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery and other science issue), 96 projects in H1507 (wound healing and scar), 88 projects in H1502 (multi-organ failure), 71 projects in H1505 (burn), 61 projects in H1504 (trauma). (2) The top 10 working unit for project funding in the field of emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery present as Third Military Medical University (70), Shanghai Jiao tong University (69), Second Military Medical University (40), Chinese PLA General Hospital (36), Forth Military Medical University (35), Zhejiang University (22), Sun Yat-Sen University (18), Southern Medical University (14), China Medical University (11), Capital Medical University (11) respectively, the number of funded project positive correlated with funding. (3) The funded research field in H15 covered almost all important organs and system injury or repair research, our scientists reached a fairly high level in some research field, for example, sepsis, trauma, repair, et al. \"Sepsis\" was funded 112 projects in H15 for 4 years, the growth rate became rapid and stable comparing to shock, burns and cardiopulmonary resuscitation funded projects' number. \"Emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns\" research fields related to heart, lung, bone/cartilage/muscle, stomach/intestinal/liver, brain/spinal cord/peripheral nerve and other tissues/organs. The number of funded projects in plastic surgery related research fields in angioma and flap related projects were down below to 3 projects, but the number of funded project in wounds, scar repair related research field were more than other fields relatively. (4) In frontier and research hot issue, the funded rate represent as 23.8%, 21.4%, 19.0% and 23.9% in stem cell related research fields in 4 years respectively. The funded rate average to 20.9% in epigenetic related research fields for four years, the funded rate achieved to break through \"zero\" in autophagy related research fields, the total rate raised to 32.6% from 2011 to 2013.The funded number and funding were raised rapidly in the fields of emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery from NSFC. The application for each proposal should be focus on concise or upgrade the scientific issues to improve the quality. The depth or systematic in content and interdisciplinary research fields (e.g. immunology) should be paid attention to. Sepsis, trauma and burns will be the main stream direction in future in the fields of emergency and intensive care medicine/trauma/burns/plastic surgery. The fields of wound healing and scar, surface organ defects, damage, repair and regeneration, surface tissue/organ transplantation and reconstruction, craniofacial deformities and correction are important develop directions in future work.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and
