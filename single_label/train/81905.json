{"id":81905,"title":"Expression of tumor necrosis factor ? and its correlation with severity of oral submucous fibrosis: a case-control study.","abstract":"The objective of this case-control study was to evaluate the plasma tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?) levels in patients with oral submucous fibrosis and to determine the relation of plasma TNF-? levels with the severity of oral submucous fibrosis.Blood samples were collected from 25 patients who were diagnosed with oral submucous fibrosis and from 25 age- and sex-matched control participants. The plasma was isolated by centrifugation of blood samples. The levels of plasma TNF-? were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.A total of 19 out of 25 patients had detectable plasma TNF-? levels ranging from 0.1 to 106.4 pg/mL (mean, 23.46 pg/mL), whereas only 12 out of 25 control participants had detectable plasma TNF-? levels ranging from 0.1 to 33.3 pg/mL (mean, 6.93 pg/mL). The difference between the TNF-? levels of patients and controls was statistically significant (P = .015) according to the Mann-Whitney test.Patients with oral submucous fibrosis had significantly increased TNF-? levels compared with controls.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787450","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.685087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.671351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.646419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.48849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Centrifugation","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.214558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.207748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Oral submucous fibrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_submucous_fibrosis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
