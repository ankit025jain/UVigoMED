{"id":38078,"title":"Adaptive behavior and problem behavior in young children with Williams syndrome.","abstract":"The present study compares the adaptive behavior profile of 18 young children with Williams syndrome (WS) and a developmentally matched group of 19 children with developmental disabilities and examines the relationship between adaptive behavior and problem behaviors in WS. Parents completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales-Interview edition and the Developmental Behavior Checklist-Primary Caregiver version (WS only). Children with WS had higher adaptive communication scores than children with other developmental disabilities. Children with WS demonstrated relative strengths in adaptive communication and socialization, coupled with relative weaknesses in daily living. Adaptive communication and socialization were negatively associated with problem behaviors in social relating in WS.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450321","annotations":[{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.846155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.716871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.657805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Williams syndrome","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_syndrome"},{"name":"Socialization","weight":0.198481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Vineland, New Jersey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineland,_New_Jersey"},{"name":"Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Writers_to_Her_Majesty's_Signet"},{"name":"Williams F1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_F1"}]}
