{"id":9327,"title":"Prevention of CpG-induced pregnancy disruption by adoptive transfer of in vitro-induced regulatory T cells.","abstract":"To elucidate the mechanism by which embryo-resorption and preterm birth were enhanced by pathogenic CpG motif and to develop a counter strategy for normal pregnancy outcome.This is an animal model-based study. In pregnant nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and wild-type (WT) mice in the same strain background, an infection was mimicked by toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation through CpG1826-injection. In vivo inactivation of IL-10 was performed to enhance pregnancy loss. Regulatory T cells induced by FTY720 in vitro from splenic CD4+CD25-Foxp3- cells (iTreg cells) were transferred to improve pregnancy outcomes in NOD mice.Embryo-resorption and preterm birth were readily induced by CpG1826 in NOD mice, but not in WT mice. However, inactivation of IL-10 using neutralizing antibody injections enhanced pregnancy loss in WT mice exposed to CpG, while adoptive transfer of iTreg cells increased decidual Foxp3+ Treg cells and IL-10+ cell number and rescued pregnancy.NOD mice are prone to abortion and preterm birth. This can be attributed to lacking Treg cells and insufficient IL-10 expression. Adoptive transfer of iTreg cells can rescue CpG-mediated pregnancy failure.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714634","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.891218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.787264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.651267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.590351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.57368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.572214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Fingolimod","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingolimod"},{"name":"NOD mice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD_mice"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"}]}
