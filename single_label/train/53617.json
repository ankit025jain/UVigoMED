{"id":53617,"title":"Diabetes and pregnancy: time to rethink the focus on type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"With the increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity in Australia, more women with type 2 diabetes are becoming pregnant. Our study confirms that pregnancies with type 2 diabetes have poorer outcomes and there is a strong need for further research into modification of risk factors associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in type 2 diabetes. We believe it is time to rethink the strategies to improve their outcomes.
