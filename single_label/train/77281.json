{"id":77281,"title":"[The characteristics of psychosocial risks in the banking sector: a brief report].","abstract":"Psychosocial risks in workplace are common phenomenon, stressing even for so-called white collar workers. The aim of the study was to indicate the most important threats in terms of banking sector employees.The studied subjects were 484 employees employed in 26 companies. The Scale of Psychosocial Risk (SPR) was used as a research tool.The most frequent and the most stressful categories of threats were: lack of control over workload and lack of career development chances. Banking sector employees are obliged to follow strict procedures of customer service and they regard their promotion chances as low. Employees's appraisal system is another strongly stressful factor. Work in a banking sector involves a great mental strain and the high risk of dismissal. Interpersonal relationships at work turned out to be the least stressful work facet in the banking sector.Given the most serious sources of psychosocial risks, the authors suggested to take the following actions: changes in work and work control system, education of employees and managerial staff and regular monitoring of occurring threats.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230568","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Bank","weight":0.788535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.601239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Customer service","weight":0.438319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service"},{"name":"White-collar worker","weight":0.417895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.393297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Customer","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Control system","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system"},{"name":"Career development","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_development"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Total chances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_chances"},{"name":"Facet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet"},{"name":"Collar (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(clothing)"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0162824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Termination of employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termination_of_employment"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"},{"name":"Promotion (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)"},{"name":"Self control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_control"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
