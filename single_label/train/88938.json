{"id":88938,"title":"Soft-tissue response rate to chin skeletal advancement in patients with lower facial burn scar.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and the soft-tissue response to osseous genioplasty in patients with chin retrusion caused by early life facial burn injury.Twenty-two consecutive patients with retrusive chin as a result of severe childhood facial burn were included in this study. Cephalometric analysis and photographs were used to assess the patients for eligibility of a surgical correction. Horizontal hard-tissue advancement and soft-tissue responses were measured as the primary outcomes at the early and late postoperative follow-up visits.A total of 22 patients fulfilled the study requirements. Average preoperative distance between the pogonion, as the most anterior point of the anterior mandibular contour, and a perpendicular line connecting the nasion and the supramental point of the mandible was 0.82 ± 1.1 mm, which increased significantly to 7.8 ± 0.8 mm after genioplasty (p < 0.0001). Soft tissue was repositioned on average 6.1 ± 0.4 mm anteriorly on average, which is in comparison with the amount of chin skeleton advancement, and a response ratio of 0.8:1 was calculated at late follow-up.Burn-related retrusive chin can appropriately be treated with sliding osseous genioplasty and will require slight overcorrection compared with patients without a history of lower face burn.Therapeutic, IV.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776569","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.720727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.645528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.63861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.562222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.541879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.536201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.444757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Chin","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.121983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Genioplasty","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genioplasty"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nasion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasion"},{"name":"Cephalometric analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"name":"Supermind (Integral thought)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermind_(Integral_thought)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Perpendicular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Horizontal (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_(album)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
