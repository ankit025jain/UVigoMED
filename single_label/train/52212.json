{"id":52212,"title":"The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes increases with a body mass index of > or = 23 kg/m2 in Filipino American women.","abstract":"Although elevated body mass index (BMI) increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes universally, the BMI associated with increased risk for these two diseases needs to be established for Filipino American women (FAW). The relationship of BMI with diabetes and other CVD risk factors in FAW was investigated to determine if BMI levels less than the conventional 25 kg/m2 are associated with increased CVD risk factors.In a cross-sectional study conducted in four cities, FAW (n=193), aged 40 to 65 years, were screened for CVD risk factors and diabetes. Mean concentrations and prevalence of CVD risk factors were examined as a function of BMI category (BMI < or =22.9 n=41, BMI 23-24.9 n=46, BMI 25-29.9 n=75, and BMI > or =30 n= 31).Body mass index correlated significantly with waist circumference (P<.0001), systolic blood pressure (P<.0001), diastolic blood pressure (P<.001), fasting blood glucose (P<.05), hemoglobin A1c (P<.001), triglycerides (P<.001), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (P<.001) and high density lipoprotein -C (P<.001). The prevalence of diabetes, decreased levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, hypertension, elevated triglycerides, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein increased significantly (P<.01-.001) with BMI categories starting at BMI 23-24.9 kg/m2.Body mass index was an excellent predictor of elevated CVD risk factors in this population and the prevalence of most of these factors increased at BMIs as low as 23-24.9 kg/m2 suggesting a need to investigate risk factors and CVD events as a function of BMI in larger studies of Filipino American women.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620448","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.793617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.641958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.382766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.353518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.283683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.212435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Philippines","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
