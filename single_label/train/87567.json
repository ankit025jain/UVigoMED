{"id":87567,"title":"A retrospective analysis of the use of cannulated compression screws and a vascularised iliac bone graft in the treatment of displaced fracture of the femoral neck in patients aged < 50 years.","abstract":"There is a high risk of the development of avascular necrosis of the femoral head and nonunion after the treatment of displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck in patients aged < 50 years. We retrospectively analysed the results following fixation with two cannulated compression screws and a vascularised iliac bone graft. We treated 18 women and 16 men with a mean age of 38.5 years (20 to 50) whose treatment included the use of an iliac bone graft based on the ascending branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery. There were 20 Garden grade III and 14 grade IV fractures. Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated. The mean follow-up was 5.4 years (2 to 10). In 30 hips (88%) union was achieved at a mean of 4.4 months (4 to 6). Nonunion occurred in four hips (12%) and these patients had a mean age of 46.5 years (42 to 50) and underwent revision to a hip replacement six months after operation. The time to union was dependent on age with younger patients achieving earlier union (p < 0.001). According to the Harris hip score which was available for 27 of the 30 hips with satisfactory union, excellent results were obtained in 15 (score ? 90 points), fair in ten (score 80 to 90 points), and poor in two hips (? 80 points). One patient aged 48 years developed avascular necrosis of femoral head six years after operation and underwent total hip replacement. The management of displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck, in patients aged < 50 years, with two cannulated compression screws and an iliac bone graft based on the ascending branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery, gives satisfactory results with a low rate of complication including avascular necrosis and nonunion.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086116","annotations":[{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.75467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.670534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.59809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.410973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Lateral circumflex femoral artery","weight":0.356468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_circumflex_femoral_artery"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.277135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.110635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.106637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0541379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circumflex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Circumflex branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"}]}
