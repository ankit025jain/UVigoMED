{"id":84939,"title":"The bile duct in donation after cardiac death donor liver transplant.","abstract":"This review considers the biliary complications associated with liver transplantation using donation after cardiac death (DCD) donor grafts.The increasing use of DCD liver grafts with their increased incidence of biliary complications is discussed. The ethics of this greater use is briefly analysed. Recent animal and human study evidence to support the peribiliary vascular plexus' role in ischaemic cholangiopathy is reviewed. Recent advances in in-vivo and ex-vivo perfusion are explored. In particular, the latest theories regarding perfusion's peribiliary plexus preserving effects and the mechanism by which biliary regeneration may be promoted as a consequence are discussed.This article explores the need for DCD liver graft use and the associated biliary complications. The current theories regarding the cause of DCD biliary complications are reviewed, as are the current strategies to reduce them.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010065","annotations":[{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.755687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.491439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.410378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.251952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Brachial plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Non-heart-beating donation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-heart-beating_donation"}]}
