{"id":75789,"title":"Targeted treatment of migrating partial seizures of infancy with quinidine.","abstract":"Migrating partial seizures of infancy is an early onset epileptic encephalopathy syndrome that is typically resistant to treatment. The most common cause is a gain of function mutation in the potassium channel KCNT1. The antiarrhythmic drug quinidine is a partial antagonist of KCNT1 and hence may be a candidate drug for treatment of this condition. We report the case of a child with migrating partial seizures of infancy secondary to an activating mutation in KCNT1 treated with quinidine. Treatment with quinidine was correlated with a marked reduction in seizure frequency and improved psychomotor development.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042079","annotations":[{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.580675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.546686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Quinidine","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinidine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.15263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.061875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Antiarrhythmic agent","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiarrhythmic_agent"},{"name":"Potassium channel","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Complex partial seizure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_partial_seizure"}]}
