{"id":37675,"title":"Structural and clinical implications of amino acid substitutions in ?-L-iduronidase: insight into the basis of mucopolysaccharidosis type I.","abstract":"Allelic mutations, predominantly missense ones, of the ?-l-iduronidase (IDUA) gene cause mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), which exhibits heterogeneous phenotypes. These phenotypes are basically classified into severe, intermediate, and attenuated types. We previously examined the structural changes in IDUA due to MPS I by homology modeling, but the reliability was limited because of the low sequence identity. In this study, we built new structural models of mutant IDUAs due to 57 amino acid substitutions that had been identified in 27 severe, 1 severe-intermediate, 13 intermediate, 1 attenuated-intermediate and 15 attenuated type MPS I patients based on the crystal structure of human IDUA, which was recently determined by us. The structural changes were examined by calculating the root-mean-square distances (RMSD) and the number of atoms influenced by the amino acid replacements. The results revealed that the structural changes of the enzyme protein tended to be correlated with the severity of the disease. Then we focused on the structural changes resulting from amino acid replacements in the immunoglobulin-like domain and adjacent region, of which the structure had been missing in the IDUA model previously built. Coloring of atoms influenced by an amino acid substitution was performed in each case and the results revealed that the structural changes occurred in a region far from the active site of IDUA, suggesting that they affected protein folding. Structural analysis is thus useful for elucidation of the basis of MPS I.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480078","annotations":[{"name":"Homology modeling","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_modeling"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.737157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Active site","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_site"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.5818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Crystal structure","weight":0.532646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.526523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.458384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Mucopolysaccharidosis","weight":0.361448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucopolysaccharidosis"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.361427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.343173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.312002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Root mean square deviation (bioinformatics)","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square_deviation_(bioinformatics)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}]}
