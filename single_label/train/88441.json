{"id":88441,"title":"Osseous injuries associated with anterior shoulder instability: what the radiologist should know.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the Hill-Sachs lesion and anterior glenoid bone loss and to discuss the role of imaging in identifying and accurately describing these injuries.Understanding the underlying mechanics of anterior shoulder instability that result in Hill-Sachs lesions and glenoid bone loss, the strengths and weaknesses of the different imaging modalities ordered for their evaluation, and the methods used to characterize these osseous injuries on imaging are essential for the radiologist in this clinical setting.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848847","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.764848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.472954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.428105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Stimulus modality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_modality"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"}]}
