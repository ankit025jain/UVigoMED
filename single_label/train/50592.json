{"id":50592,"title":"Association and predictive value analysis for resting heart rate and diabetes mellitus on cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in general population.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of DM and resting HR on CAN in a large sample derived from a Chinese population.We conducted a large-scale, population-based, cross-sectional study to explore the relationships of CAN with DM and resting HR. A total of 387 subjects were diagnosed with CAN in our dataset. The associations of CAN with DM and resting HR were assessed by a multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analysis (using subjects without CAN as a reference group) after controlling for potential confounding factors. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive performance of resting HR and DM.A tendency toward increased CAN prevalence with increasing resting HR was reported (P for trend <0.001). MLR analysis showed that DM and resting HR were very significantly and independently associated with CAN (P < 0.001 for both). Resting HR alone or combined with DM (DM-HR) both strongly predicted CAN (AUC = 0.719, 95% CI 0.690-0.748 for resting HR and AUC = 0.738, 95% CI 0.710-0.766 for DM-HR).Our findings signify that resting HR and DM-HR have a high value in predicting CAN in the general population.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772443","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.658315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"China","weight":0.364223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"766","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/766"},{"name":"719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/719"},{"name":"738","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/738"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Value engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_engineering"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"7th millennium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_millennium"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Predictive inference","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Dysautonomia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 7100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7100"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
