{"id":68432,"title":"The influence of hemodialysis duration on the concentration of inflammatory agents in chronic hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"The goal of this study is to determine the effect of the hemodialysis durations on the concentration of inflammatory agents C-reactive protein concentration, fibrinogen and ferritin in hemodialysis patients. There is not enough reliable research data about the primary causes of the increase of these agents levels in the serum. The role of inflammatory agents in the development of primary renal disease, pathogenesis and morphogenesis and in particular the development of complications and comorbidities is unclear.The study included 114 chronic hemodialysis patients who were on dialysis three times a week for 4 hours, according to the regular protocol of hemodialysis at the Cantonal Hospital Zenica, Department for hemodialysis.Patients were analyzed according to the hemodialysis duration (years) and on the basis of duration of hemodialysis are divided into 3 groups: According to the average values of fibrinogen in all three groups was p < 0.05 which is not statistically significant difference according to the hemodialysis duration. Average values of ferritin in group 1 (patients less than 1 year on hemodialysis) was 612 +/- 543 in group 2 (patients with hemodialysis duration between 1-10 years) was 1056 +/- 852, and in group 3 (patients with hemodialysis duration over 10 years) was 610 +/- 700. According to the average values of ferritin in all three groups we see that p < 0.05. In the second group ferritin concentrations were highest. In the third group of patients the results were the same as in the first group.It was found that the duration and type of hemodialysis does not affect the concentration of inflammatory agents in the blood.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520748","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.779953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.571178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.484501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Zenica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenica"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"543","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/543"},{"name":"852","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/852"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"1056","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1056"},{"name":"Cantons of Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"List of Kodokan judo techniques","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kodokan_judo_techniques"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
