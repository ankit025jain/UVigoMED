{"id":52255,"title":"New AHA and ACC guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk.","abstract":"After the publication of the new guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society for the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemias (Eur Heart J 32:1769-1818, 2011; Eur Heart J 33:1635-1701, 2012), a group of authors has recently published on behalf of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (Circulation 2013). These new guidelines are supposed to replace the until now widely accepted, at least in the USA, recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III from the years 2002 (Circulation 106:3143-3421, 2002) and 2004 (Circulation 110:227-39, 2004). Furthermore, they claim to be based mainly on hard evidence derived from the interpretation of results of prospective randomized controlled trials. This Joint Position Statement of the Society for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases e.V. (D.A.CH), the Austrian Atherosclerosis Society and the Working Group on Lipids and Atherosclerosis (AGLA) of the Swiss Society of Cardiology concludes that the use of individualized prevention strategies based on specific indications and LDL cholesterol target concentrations, a strategy whose worth has been widely proven and accepted for more than a decade in Europe, should not be given up.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615676","annotations":[{"name":"American Heart Association","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"American College of Cardiology","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Cardiology"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.679652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.644715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.616243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.609814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.484083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.337526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.236621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.214038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"European Society of Cardiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Society_of_Cardiology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"}]}
