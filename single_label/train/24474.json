{"id":24474,"title":"Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: spread of specific lineages among patients in different wards at a Brazilian teaching hospital.","abstract":"This study aimed to characterize meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lineages circulating in a Brazilian teaching hospital. MRSA isolates from nasal swabs were evaluated to assess antimicrobial susceptibility, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), Panton-Valentine leucocidin status, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile and multi-locus sequence type (MLST) analysis. Eighty-three MRSA isolates were analysed. SCCmec III (43.4%) and IV (49.4%) were predominant. ST1-IV (USA400) was more common in internal medicine (P = 0.002) whereas 'clone M' (SCCmec III) was more common in the medical and surgical intensive care unit (P = 0.004), and all isolates were ST5-IV (USA800) in dermatology (P < 0.001). These data improved the understanding of the MRSA epidemiology inside the hospital and helped to establish effective control measures.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433925","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.788919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.687032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.647608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.638963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.521476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.416095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.406108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.404932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.368006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.30633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.2352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.234872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.232613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Mara language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_language"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
