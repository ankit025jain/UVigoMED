{"id":9292,"title":"VEGF-A blockade reduces reperfusion edema but favors arterial thromboembolism in a rat model of orthotopic lung transplantation.","abstract":"Ischemia-reperfusion edema is a common early complication after lung transplantation where the hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A plays a pivotal role. It remains unclear whether a VEGF blockade is beneficial in lung transplantation.VEGF-A blockade was investigated in an orthotopic rat model of lung transplantation. VEGF-A antibody was added into the preservation solution alone (?-VEGF D/-), in the preservation solution and systemically to the recipient before reperfusion (?-VEGF D/R), or applied to the recipient alone before reperfusion (?-VEGF -/R). Forty-eight hours after lung transplantation, left lungs were collected and wet-to-dry ratio, Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunohistology were performed.VEGF-A blockade in ?-VEGF D/-, ?-VEGF D/R, and ?-VEGF -/R resulted in neutralization of tissue VEGF-A. Reperfusion edema was only reduced in ?-VEGF D/R and ?-VEGF D/- groups versus Perfadex controls. Some ?-VEGF -/R rats showed a hyperinflammation leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions as well as increased edema. Whereas generally the ?-VEGF D/- group showed decreased inflammation, the combination with anti-VEGF treatment to the recipient resulted in a pro-inflammatory and a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Short-term survival, however, was not significantly different in all groups as compared to the controls. In the ?-VEGF (D/R) or (D/-) groups, animals mainly died from arterial thromboembolisms and in the ?-VEGF (-/R) group, hyperinflammation was the main cause of death.VEGF-A directly contributes to the formation of a reperfusion edema, which might be reduced by its blockade. However, the ?-VEGF effect on the endothelial integrity might also favor arterial thrombosis formation.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717222","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.751649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.532337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung transplantation","weight":0.39495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_transplantation"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.327954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.260167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.224923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Proinflammatory cytokine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proinflammatory_cytokine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"}]}
