{"id":62948,"title":"[Six Kawasaki disease patients with acute coronary artery thrombosis].","abstract":"To improve the awareness of acute coronary artery thrombosis in Kawasaki disease (KD).Six KD patients with acute coronary artery thrombosis (Jan. 2004 to Jan. 2013) were studied retrospectively. The basic information, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG), method and consequence of thrombolytic therapy were analyzed.The mean age of patients with coronary artery thrombosis (5 males and 1 female) was (17.2 ± 11.3) months.Five cases had thrombosis in left coronary artery (LCA), and four cases had thrombosis in aneurysm of left anterior descending artery (LAD). One case had thrombosis in both left and right coronary artery (RCA).One case died. Maximum thrombus was about 1.60 cm × 0.80 cm, locating in LAD. The diameter of LCA and RCA was (0.44 ± 0.07) cm and (0.45 ± 0.07) cm. Two patients showed abnormal ECG. Case 3 showed ST segment depression in lead V5. Case 6 showed myocardial infarction.In acute phase of KD, three patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), five patients were treated with aspirin.In sub-acute and convalescent phase of KD, all patients were treated with low-dose aspirin.Warfarin and dipyridamole were applied in 5 patients. All cases were treated with thrombolytic therapy using urokinase and/or heparin. After thrombolytic therapy, echocardiography showed thrombolysis in four cases and no change in one.One patient died of myocardial infarction.Most of acute coronary thrombosis in KD occurred in LAD. KD patients with coronary artery thrombosis are at risk of sudden death due to myocardial infarction.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495764","annotations":[{"name":"Dipyridamole","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipyridamole"},{"name":"Urokinase","weight":0.89418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.849453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.782675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Coronary thrombosis","weight":0.747825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_thrombosis"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.736937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.688752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.657534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.463093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Thrombolytic drug","weight":0.263099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolytic_drug"},{"name":"Left coronary artery","weight":0.183682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.112892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Acute-phase protein","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute-phase_protein"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Right coronary artery","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Visual cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Convalescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence"}]}
