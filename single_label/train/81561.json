{"id":81561,"title":"Treatment effects of a modified palatal anchorage plate for distalization evaluated with cone-beam computed tomography.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment effects of maxillary posterior tooth distalization performed by a modified palatal anchorage plate appliance with cephalograms derived from cone-beam computed tomography.The sample consisted of 40 lateral cephalograms obtained from the cone-beam computed tomography images of 20 Class II patients (7 men, 13 women; average age, 22.9 years) who underwent bilateral distalization of their maxillary dentition. The lateral cephalograms were derived from the cone-beam computed tomography images taken immediately before placement of a modified palatal anchorage plate appliance and at the end of distalization. Paired t tests were used for comparisons of the changes.The distal movement of the maxillary first molar was 3.3 ± 1.8 mm, with distal tipping of 3.4° ± 5.8° and intrusion of 1.8 ± 1.4 mm. Moreover, the maxillary incisors moved 3.0 ± 2.7 mm lingually, with lingual tipping of 6.2° ± 7.6° and insignificant extrusion (1.1 mm; P = 0.06). The occlusal plane angle was increased significantly (P = 0.0001).The maxillary first molar was distalized by 3.3 mm at the crown and 2.2 mm at root levels, with distal tipping of 3.4°. It is recommended that clinicians should consider using the modified palatal anchorage plate appliance in treatment planning for patients who require maxillary total arch distalization.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974998","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.809076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.69477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.602988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.553583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Maxillary first molar","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_first_molar"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.36145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.315764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.258384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.134162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Horse gait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Intrusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Anchorage, Alaska","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
