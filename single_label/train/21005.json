{"id":21005,"title":"Possible options for new pertussis vaccines.","abstract":"Increasing evidence that the currently available acellular pertussis vaccines are not providing optimal control of pertussis in the United States and many other countries has stimulated interest in improvements of the current vaccines and in the development of new vaccines. A better understanding of the limitations of the current vaccines and the basis for the pertussis resurgence is needed to design improved vaccines. This article outlines several alternate approaches and summarizes the challenges related to the development of new or modified vaccines.
