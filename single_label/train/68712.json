{"id":68712,"title":"Prepubertal male genitourinary metastatic Crohn's disease: report of a case and review of literature.","abstract":"Chronic penile swelling in prepubertal boys is an uncommon problem. The differential diagnosis includes primary and secondary lymphedema, trauma, previous penile surgery, and extraintestinal metastatic Crohn's disease. We report a 6-year-old boy who presented with persistent penile edema as an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease. In this case, the penile edema preceded the overt bowel symptoms associated with Crohn's disease, and a high index of suspicion led to the underlying diagnosis. Few previous reports have reviewed the different treatment options and their associated outcomes for Crohn's disease in prepubertal boys with genital edema.
