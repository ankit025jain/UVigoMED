{"id":67629,"title":"Long-term results of a phase II study with neoadjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy and complete androgen blockade in locally advanced and high-risk prostate cancer.","abstract":"Patients with locally advanced and high-risk prostate cancer (LAPC) are prone to experience biochemical recurrence despite radical prostatectomy (RP). We evaluated feasibility, safety and activity of a neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NCHT) with 3-weekly full dose docetaxel and complete androgen blockade (CAB) in locally advanced and high-risk prostate cancer patients (LAPC) undergoing RP.Patients (n?=?30) were selected by Kattans' preoperative score and received trimestral buserelin 9,45 mg, bicalutamide 50 mg/day and 3 cycles docetaxel (75 mg/mÂ²) followed by RP. Primary endpoints were biochemical (PSA) and local downstaging. Secondary endpoints included toxicity and operability assessments, pathological complete response (pCR), time to PSA progression, 5-year biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS) and overall survival (OS).Median baseline PSA was 25.8 ng/ml (2.1-293), and the predicted probability of 5-year bRFS was 10% (0-55). NCHT induced PSA-reduction was 97.3% (81.3-99.9%; p?<?0.001) and post-RP 96.7% of patients were therapy responders, with undetectable PSA-values. Post- vs. pretreatment MRI indicated a median tumor volume reduction of 46.4% (-31.3-82.8; p?<?0.001). A pathological downstaging was observed in 48.3%. Severe hematologic toxicities (?CTC3) were frequent with 53.8% leucopenia, 90% neutropenia and 13.3% febrile neutropenia. RP was performed in all patients. While resectability was hindered in 26.7%, continence was achieved in 96.7%. Pathologic analyses revealed no pCR. Lymph node- and extracapsular involvement was observed in 36.7% and 56.7% with 33.3% positive surgical margins. After a median of 48.6 (19.9-87.8) months, 55.2% of therapy responders experienced PSA-recurrence. The estimated median time to PSA-progression was 38.6 months (95%CI 30.9-46.4) and 85.3 months (95%CI 39.3-131.3) for OS. The 5-year bRFS was improved to 40%, but limiting for interpretation adjuvant treatment was individualized.NCHT is feasible despite high hematotoxicity, with excellent functional results. Significant downstaging was observed without pCR. NCHT seems to improve the cohort adjusted 5-year bRFS, but clinical value needs further investigation in randomized trials.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598155","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Bicalutamide","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicalutamide"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Buserelin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buserelin"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Operability","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operability"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.62604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.602932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.5385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.349677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.348859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.2315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.119063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
