{"id":40797,"title":"Progression of diet induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is accompanied by increased expression of Kruppel-like-factor 10 in mice.","abstract":"Kruppel-like-factor (KLF) 10 is identified as transforming growth factor (TGF) ? inducible early gene and is reported to suppress lipogenic genes. Although previous studies report that TGF? plays an important role in progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by regulating liver fibrosis, the association of KLF10 and NASH has never been explored. Thus we evaluated expressions and changes of KLF10 in diet induced NASH and in NASH which was alleviated by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We also assessed KLF10 in quiescent and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).C57BL/6 mice were given high fat, sucrose diet (HFSD) at least for 12 weeks up to 48 weeks and sacrificed at 12, 24 and 48 weeks thereafter. In other groups, either standard diet (SD) or HFSD was given for 24 weeks at which point mice fed with HFSD were divided into two groups, and were given either UDCA in combination with HFSD or vehicle with HFSD. Mice under SD were given vehicle. HSCs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice in order to evaluated KLF10 expression in activated HSCs.The mice were found to acquire liver steatosis and inflammation starting from week 12 of HFSD feeding, although significant liver fibrosis was noticed by week 24. Increased TGF? and collagen ?1(I) (Col1?(I)) expression was also apparent from week 24. However, expression of KLF10 mRNA started to increase from week 12, earlier than TGF? gene. Up-regulation of KLF10 was accompanied by suppressed carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) that is known to be protective against insulin resistance. The mice fed with HFSD and UDCA had decreased Col?(I) mRNA that was coincided with reduced TGF? and KLF10 expression. Expression of ChREBP was also recovered by UDCA administration. Enhanced KLF10 was noticed in activated HSCs when quiescent cell showed minimal expression.Our study demonstrated that KLF10 expression was significantly increased in diet induced NASH and collagen producing activated HSCs. We also noticed that this up-regulation of KLF10 was accompanied by increased TGF? signaling genes and suppressed ChREBP expression. These observations suggest possible association of KLF10 and NASH progression.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986741","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.854079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.715845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.644958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.542113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.509291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatic stellate cell","weight":0.501145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_stellate_cell"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.386427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Ursodiol","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursodiol"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.173415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.115315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"MLXIPL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLXIPL"},{"name":"G0 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0_phase"},{"name":"Kupffer cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell"}]}
