{"id":72288,"title":"Incidentally diagnosed giant invasive sacral schwannoma. Its clinical features and surgical management without stability.","abstract":"Schwannomas are benign encapsulated tumors of Schwan cells that grow slowly along the peripheral myelin nerve fibers. Sacral spinal schwannomas are very rare, and the incidence of sacral schwannoma ranges from 1-5% of all spinal schwannomas, and only around 50 cases are reported in the literature. There are 3 defined types of sacral schwannomas. These are retroperitoneal or presacral, intra osseous, and spinal schwannomas. Patients commonly present with complaints of pain and paresthesia due to the spinal schwannoma extending to extra spinal tissues. Direct x-ray, CT, MRI, and scintigraphy are used for preoperative diagnosis and treatment planning. Local recurrence and transformation to malignancy is very rare. For this reason, the frequently preferred treatments are subtotal removal of the mass or simple enucleation. In our article, we discuss the clinical features and the surgical treatment we performed without the need for stabilization in an incidentally determined giant invasive schwannoma case.
