{"id":6659,"title":"Evaluating the role of nucleic acid antigens in murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Impaired apoptotic cell clearance is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmune disease, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Endogenous RNA- and DNA-containing autoantigens released from dying cells can engage Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7/8 and TLR9, respectively in a number of immune cell types, thereby promoting innate and adaptive immune responses. Mouse models of lupus reliably phenocopy many of the characteristic features of SLE in humans and these models have proved invaluable in defining disease mechanisms. TLR7 signaling is essential for the development of autoantibodies to RNA and RNA-associated proteins like Sm and RNP, while TLR9 signaling is important for the development of antibodies to DNA and chromatin. TLR7 deficiency ameliorates end-organ disease, but, surprisingly, TLR9 deficiency exacerbates disease, possibly as a result of TLR7 overactivity in TLR9-deficient mice. Deficiency of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) inhibits autoantibody production and ameliorates disease likely due to its role in both TLR7 and TLR9 signaling. In this report we describe methods to analyze two commonly used mouse models of SLE in which TLRs and/or IRF5 have been shown to play a role in disease pathogenesis.
