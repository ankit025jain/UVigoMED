{"id":32799,"title":"Myelopathy due to lumbar disc herniation in the presence of a tethered cord.","abstract":"Single case report.To present a case of lumbar disc herniation causing compression of a tethered cord that was successfully treated with lumbar decompression and fusion.A tethered cord is a rare pathology associated with a congenital spinal malformation, spinal dysraphism. Furthermore, myelopathy due to lumbar disc herniation in the presence of a tethered cord is extremely rare.Single case report.A 43-year-old male with a history of spina bifida presented to our clinic for an evaluation of a progressive spastic gait disturbance and numbness in the lower limbs. A neurological examination revealed muscle weakness and pyramidal tract signs in the lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine showed disc herniation at L2-3 causing compression of a low-lying cord. Surgical intervention, including herniotomy via a posterolateral approach and instrumented posterolateral fusion, was performed, and a good outcome was achieved 1 year after the surgery.The potential for lumbar disc herniation in the presence of a tethered cord should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of spinal pathologies causing spastic gait disturbances. Furthermore, posterior decompression and fusion is a useful treatment option in such cases.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
