{"id":23646,"title":"IGRA-positive patients and interferon-gamma/interleukin-2 signatures: can the Fluorospot assay provide further information?","abstract":"A goal of testing for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection is to identify individuals who are at increased risk for the development of active TB. No laboratory tool is currently available to distinguish between individuals in the process of progressing from latent TB infection towards active disease and those who are not. Determination of the interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 T cell signature might provide an additional and rapid tool to evaluate treatment necessity and clinical management of a patient. Here, we present three cases of interferon-gamma release assay-positive patients with differing interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 signatures when analyzed by the Fluorospot assay.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477887","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.44354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.328606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.303713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Signature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature"},{"name":"Laboratory equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_equipment"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
