{"id":11756,"title":"Local control of repeated-dose rectal challenges in DNA/MVA-vaccinated macaques protected against a first series of simian immunodeficiency virus challenges.","abstract":"Here, we report the results of a late boost and three additional series of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenges in seven DNA/modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vaccinated rhesus macaques who resisted a first series of rectal challenges. During 29 additional challenges delivered over 2.3 years, all animals became infected. However, 13 blips of virus in six macaques and anamnestic Env-specific rectal IgA responses in three of the six suggested that local control of infections was occurring during the serial challenge.
