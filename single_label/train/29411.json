{"id":29411,"title":"A randomized controlled phase II trial of a novel composition of paclitaxel embedded into neutral and cationic lipids targeting tumor endothelial cells in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).","abstract":"EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).One hundred and forty patients were treated with weekly EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2× 44 mg/m(2)), or weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four cycles (3-week treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four cycles of therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup comparisons.The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, ?] on combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, ?] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5, ?] on paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months, respectively. After complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall survival (OS) was 13.0, 11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and 15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment groups. Safety analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight increases of grade 3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy.Treatment of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and standard paclitaxel [Taxol® (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic formulation] was well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend needs to be confirmed in a randomized phase III trial.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667715","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Bristol-Myers Squibb","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol-Myers_Squibb"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.560173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.545335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.469076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.17036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.162234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.120568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.117695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
