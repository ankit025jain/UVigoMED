{"id":47571,"title":"Portal vein thrombosis and liver transplantation: implications for waiting list period, surgical approach, early and late follow-up.","abstract":"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a well-known and relatively common complication of liver cirrhosis. In the past, PVT was considered as a contraindication for liver transplantation (LT). To characterize prevalence, risk factors, perioperative management and outcome of PVT in the setting of LT, the English literature published between 1991 and 2011 was reviewed. Of 6807 articles, 280 were selected, and 39 experiences were analyzed in detail (methodology, type and duration of treatments, peri-operative management, strategy to avoid recurrence, strengths and weaknesses, Oxford evidence level, citations). 3/39 studies were prospective; 9/39 were based on prospectively recorded databases; no studies of 1, 2a, 3a level of evidence were present; 5/39 were recognized as level 2b, 23/39 as level 3b, and 8/39 as level 4. High complication rate has been reported with consequent effect on graft and patient survival. Overall, PVT presents today good results similar to those obtained in patients without PVT undergoing LT even if they require a higher transfusion number and a longer ICU/hospital stay. Reported cases were retrospectively stratified according to Yerdel classification. Grade 1-2 patients (76%) do well with eversion thromboendovenectomy, resection of damaged vein and porto-portal anastomosis. Results of patients with grade 3-4 (24%) are inferior, however data on outcome in this subsets are fragmented and do not allow a reliable analysis. Moreover, results obtained in grade 3-4 cases are better in transplant centers with large specific experience. The small number of reports suggests caution. The role of anticoagulant treatment is still debated. Although in cirrhotics with PVT LT remains a demanding procedure, PVT should not be considered a contraindication anymore.
