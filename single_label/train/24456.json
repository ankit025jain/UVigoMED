{"id":24456,"title":"Expression comparison of azithromycin and clarithromycin in triple-therapy regimens for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"To compare a triple-therapy regimen based on change of antibiotic (azithromycin and clarithromycin) for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in hemodialysis (HD) patients, we studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial 39 patients who had dyspepsia and showed two positive results from the diagnostic tests of H. pylori infection including anti-H. pylori serology and stool antigen (HpSAg) and urease breath test (UBT). The patients were divided into two groups: Group-A received omeprazol 20 mg, amoxycilin 500 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and Group-B received omeprazol 20 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg and azithromycin 250 mg twice a day. The adverse events and compliance with triple therapy were reviewed at one visit per week. Both groups were prescribed their medications for 14 days. Of the 39 patients, only 37 patients completed the treatment schedule (20 men and 19 women, with the mean being 59 years). Two patients died due to myocardial infarction before the start of treatment and were out of the study. The eradication rate of H. pylori, evaluated by negative results of UBT, was 82.4% in Group-A and 80% in Group-B (P-value = 1.0). The results of our study showed no significant difference of azitromycin versus claritromycin in the eradication of H. pylori infection in HD patients.
