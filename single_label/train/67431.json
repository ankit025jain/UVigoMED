{"id":67431,"title":"Translation and linguistic validation of the korean version of the dysfunctional voiding symptom score.","abstract":"Although studies on pediatric dysfunctional voiding are increasing, there have not been enough efforts to validate the Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score (DVSS) questionnaire. Therefore, we aimed to translate and validate the DVSS into Korean. The DVSS questionnaire was validated between January and October, 2013. Two bilinguals independently translated the English version of the DVSS questionnaire into Korean, and then reconciled the forward translation of the Korean version. The original DVSS was back-translated into English, then assessed for equivalence to the original. Cognitive debriefing interviews with 5 patients to test the interpretation of the translation were made, then modified and distributed to 48 patients for re-evaluation. A statistical analysis of inter-scale correlation, and test re-test consistency was performed with the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The changes from patient interviews were reflected in the final version. In an intra-class correlation, the Cronbach's alpha was high in all of the questions (0.97, P < 0.001). Test re-test Cronbach's alpha analysis of reproducibility was higher than 0.8 for all of the 10 questions (P < 0.001). Translation and linguistic validation of Korean version of the DVSS questionnaire was completed by a proper process, with high reliability and validity.
