{"id":90889,"title":"Spinous process apophysitis: a cause of low back pain following repetitive hyperextension in an adolescent female dancer.","abstract":"We report a case of a 13-year-old female dancer with spinous process apophysitis following repetitive microtrauma during end-range hyperextension movements. Following appropriate rest and limitation of hyperextension, she was able to return to her previous level of training. It is important to recognize that numerous diagnostic possibilities arise when presented with a young dancer with back pain. The intention of this case report is to compare and contrast the pertinent clinical and radiologic findings of spinous process apophysitis and its more common and debilitating mimic, spondylolysis. The correct diagnosis is paramount in cases of this sort due to the variable treatment requirements of each disorder.
