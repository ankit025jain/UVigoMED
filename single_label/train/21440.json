{"id":21440,"title":"Thirty-day laboratory-based surveillance for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.","abstract":"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a growing problem in the United States. We explored the feasibility of active laboratory-based surveillance of CRE in a metropolitan area not previously considered to be an area of CRE endemicity. We provide a framework to address CRE surveillance and to monitor changes in the incidence of CRE infection over time.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602949","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.648891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.123825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Paul the Apostle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"}]}
