{"id":79418,"title":"[The assessment of the effectiveness of fenspiride (erespal) for the combined treatment of the patients presenting with exudative otitis media].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to estimate the effectiveness and safety of combined anti-inflammatory therapy of exudative otitis media with the use of fenspiride (erespal). The study included 75 patients of whom 35 (group 1) were given standard therapy supplemented by erespal (80 mg thrice daily); the remaining patients receiving standard therapy alone formed group 2 (control). The patients treated with erespal reported the subjective improvement of hearing and reduced congestion on days 7 - 8. Similar changes in group 2 occurred on day 10. It is concluded that the use of erespal for the combined treatment of the patients presenting with exudative otitis media reduces the duration of hospital stay, accelerates recovery, and promotes rapid normalization of hearing.
