{"id":78584,"title":"Cochlear implant device activation and programming: 5 days postimplantation.","abstract":"Cochlear implants (CIs) are typically activated 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery. For some patients who live in remote areas, this waiting period could impose some personal and financial burdens. The current study examined whether CI recipients can be safely and effectively fitted with their speech processor five days after their implantation.Randomized controlled trial.Tertiary referral center.A total of 23 patients (2-30 yr of age) undergoing traditional CI surgery were recruited to participate in this study. Participants were divided into 2 groups: an early-fit group whose devices were activated 5 days after surgery and standard-fit group whose devices were activated using the recommended waiting period.Measures of impedance and most comfortable levels were used to compare differences across the 2 groups of patients. Data were measured at the activation session and also at 4 weeks after the initial session.No adverse events were reported postoperatively. Electrode impedances were significantly lower for the early-fit group than that for the standard-fit group in the initial activation session but not in the 4-week follow-up session. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the stimulation fitting levels in any of the sessions.The results presented in this article demonstrated that early activation for this sample did not seem to interfere with wound healing or with the fitting parameters suggesting that early activation should be considered as viable option to better serve CI patients' individual needs.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622029","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.480247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.367671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Speech processing","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_processing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Waiting period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_period"},{"name":"Cochlear Limited","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_Limited"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Central processing unit","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
