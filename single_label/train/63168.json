{"id":63168,"title":"HBsAg is an independent prognostic factor in diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients in rituximab era: result from a multicenter retrospective analysis in China.","abstract":"This study mainly focused on the impact of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in rituximab era, using a Cox regression model to ascertain the prediction value of the serum HBV marker in survivals. Three hundred and eighty four DLBCL patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin/epirubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP-like regimens) or CHOP-like regimens were included. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients have or have not received rituximab were analyzed separately. In the CHOP group, HBV infection has not been found a profound impact on the survivals. In the R-CHOP group, PFS and OS were inferior in HBsAg-positive patients (p=0.031 and p=0.006, respectively); after adjusting for International Prognostic Index parameters, HBsAg is an independent unfavorable factor for both PFS (RR=2.492) and OS (RR=2.589).","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469952","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.794734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.518911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.515767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.442444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.311743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0632044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"589","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/589"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
