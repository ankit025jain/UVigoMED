{"id":70408,"title":"[Diagnosis and management of jugulare glomus tumor and carotid body tumor].","abstract":"To investigate diagnosis method and treatment experience of jugulare glomus tumor (JGT) and carotid body tumor (CBT).Retrospective analysis. Clinical materials from 4 patients at one genealogy with JGT and CBT were collected. The clinical features, radiological characteristics, surgical methods and prognosis were assessed. The proband suffered from left JGT and left CBT, her younger sister had right CBT as well as her younger female cousin had bilateral CBT and right JGT, her older male cousin had bilateral CBT and left JGT. These JGT and CBT in four patients were resected under general anesthesia after preoperative ultrasound, CT or CT angiography (CTA), MRI, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination as well as preoperative vascular embolization.The surgery was uneventful in four cases, and there was no hemiplegia or deaths. All patients were followed up for 2 years to 29 months without recurrence. Six months after operation, the hoarseness also disappeared in the older male cousins but did not improve significantly in younger female cousin. The younger female cousin get right peripheral facial paralysis 1 year after surgery and her temporal bone CT indicated a right JGT.It is very important to assess JGT and CBT by Ultrasound, CT, CTA, MRI and DSA. Surgical resection is the first optional treatment for JGT and CBT. Blood loss can be reduced by preop erative vascular embolization. Serious complications could be avoid by operating under microscope, which can supply a clear surgical field and make the surgeon to protect the large blood vessels and nerve.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195266","annotations":[{"name":"Temporal
