{"id":38602,"title":"A case-based approach to evaluating azithromycin use and cardiovascular risks.","abstract":"Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed macrolide antibiotic for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting. Recent data have led to a growing concern of abnormal changes in cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias associated with its use. As azithromycin continues to be prescribed, clinicians should be aware of the new safety data and how it may affect concomitant medications or comorbid conditions in a patient. This article utilizes a case-based approach to assess azithromycin use and the risk of QT-prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.
