{"id":61104,"title":"[Long-term follow-up for 39 newly diagnosed diffused large B-cell lymphoma patients treated by (R)-EPOCH].","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of (R)-EPOCH protocol on patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL). From February 2004 to April 2009, a total of 39 patients who suffered from DLBCL and received (R)-EPOCH protocol were enrolled in the study. The median age of patients was 52 years old. 24 patients were on stage I/II, and 15 cases were on stage III/IV. Patients with stage I/II were administered with 4-6 cycles of (R)-EPOCH, while other patients with stage III/IV received 6-8 cycles of (R)-EPOCH. DLBCL patients with bulky disease received radiotherapy after completion of chemotherapy. 39 patients received a total of 209 cycles of chemotherapy and the median chemotherapy cycles was 6 (range, 2-8 cycles). The results showed that the overall response rate of 39 assessable patients was 87.2%, including 28 patients (71.8%) in complete remission (CR) and 6 patients (15.4%) in partial remission(PR). With a median follow-up of 57.7 months, the 1-year overall survival rate was 81.8%, while 70.9% for 3-year and 58.8% for 5-year. The major toxicity of (R)-EPOCH protocol was hematologic toxicity and the incidence of grade III-IV neutropenia and anemia were 29.2% and 14.4%, respectively. Other toxicities were mild, no treatment-related deaths occurred. At the end of follow-up,no secondary tumors occurred. It is concluded that (R)-EPOCH protocol is a effective and safe protocol for the patients with DLBCL.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763001","annotations":[{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.752993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.667249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.442773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.376713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.261638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
