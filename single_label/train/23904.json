{"id":23904,"title":"Indolent pneumonia in a pregnant recent immigrant from Ethiopia: think TB.","abstract":"Time delay to tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis remains a public health concern. In pregnancy, early TB diagnosis is challenging and acquires further significance due to the risk of infection of the newborn as well as others in the maternity setting. We report a delay of 12 weeks in the diagnosis of TB in a pregnant recent immigrant from Ethiopia to Israel. Contact investigation revealed pulmonary TB in her two daughters aged four and seven years. We discuss the reasons for this delay in diagnosis, how a more timely diagnosis might have been made, and the dilemma of initiating treatment in unconfirmed TB.
