{"id":87267,"title":"Multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in heat stroke.","abstract":"To assess the role of proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) in the detection of changes in metabolite levels of the cerebellum after heat stroke (HS).The study group consisted of eight patients after HS, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-9. The MR studies were performed with a 1.5 T system. MR spectra were recorded from a normal-appearing cerebellum region. Spectra from patients were compared with a control group including seven age-matched healthy volunteers recorded with the same techniques. Metabolites ratios including N-acetyl aspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr), N-acetyl aspartate/creatine2 (NAA/Cr2), choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), choline/creatine2 (Cho/Cr2), and N-acetyl aspartate/choline (NAA/Cho) were calculated and the differences between the two groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyse the relationship between NAA/Cr ratios and GCS scores for eight patients after HS.In the cerebellum of the patients after HS, NAA/Cr ratios were found to be significantly decreased compared to normal controls (p = 0.004) and Cho/Cr ratios were found to be decreased compared to normal controls (p = 0.032). Significant positive correlation was found between NAA/Cr ratios and GCS scores for eight patients after HS (r = 0.748, p = 0.033).Metabolite abnormalities were seen in normal-appearing cerebellum structures in patients after HS. Proton MRS is a useful tool for evaluating major changes in metabolite levels of the cerebellum after HS and the severity of the disease can be effectively evaluated by NAA/Cr ratios.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443777","annotations":[{"name":"Proton","weight":0.829113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.823723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.746655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.720794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.544889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.498491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.373826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.0507772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Royal Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Estrous cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrous_cycle"}]}
