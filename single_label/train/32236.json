{"id":32236,"title":"I. 'Street of twins': multiple births in Cuba II. The Cuban twin registry: an update / twin research reports: cord entanglement; heritability of clubfoot; school separation / twins and twin researchers in the news: reunited at seventy-eight; basketball du","abstract":"I was part of a people-to-people tour of Havana, Cuba during the first week in April 2014. Among the many highlights of that adventure were an informal meeting with Dr Beatriz Marcheco-Teruel, from Cuba's National Center for Medical Genetics, and a visit to the famous 'Street of Twins'. A fortuitous meeting with parents of twins in the fishing town of Jaimanitas was also an extraordinary event. The Cuban experience is followed by summaries of recent twin research, covering umbilical cord entanglement, the heritability of clubfoot and school separation policies for twins. Media reports include twins reunited at age 78, the future of UCLA's twin basketball players, MZ twins born holding hands, a twin conflict over beer and a pair of American Psychological Association honors for Drs Nancy L. Segal and Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr. ","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992183","annotations":[{"name":"American Psychological Association","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association"},{"name":"Cuba","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"},{"name":"Havana","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Basketball","weight":0.385045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball"},{"name":"Twin study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.294293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.275698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Beer","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer"},{"name":"Cubans","weight":0.124839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubans"},{"name":"Fishing","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Club foot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_foot"},{"name":"Nuchal cord","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuchal_cord"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Nancy","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy"},{"name":"Adventure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure"},{"name":"Quantum entanglement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"},{"name":"Thomas the Apostle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Apostle"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Legal separation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_separation"},{"name":"George Segal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Segal"},{"name":"Medical genetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_genetics"},{"name":"Fishing Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_Town"},{"name":"Securities research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_research"},{"name":"News","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"},{"name":"Holding hands","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_hands"},{"name":"Monozygotic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monozygotic"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Minnesota Twins","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"FIBT World Championships 1960","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBT_World_Championships_1960"},{"name":"Thomas J.
