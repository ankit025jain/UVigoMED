{"id":68176,"title":"Measurement equivalence and feasibility of the EORTC QLQ-PR25: paper-and-pencil versus touch-screen administration.","abstract":"We assessed the measurement equivalence and feasibility of the paper-and-pencil and touch-screen modes of administration of the Taiwan Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-PR25, a commonly used questionnaire to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with prostate cancer in Taiwan.A cross-over design study was conducted in 99 prostate cancer patients at an urology outpatient clinic. Descriptive exact and global agreement percentages, intraclass correlation, and equivalence test based on minimal clinically important difference (MCID) approach were used to examine the equity of HRQOL scores between these two modes of administration. We also evaluated the feasibility of computerized assessment based on patients' acceptability and preference. Additionally, we used Rasch rating scale model to assess differential item functioning (DIF) between the two modes of administration.The percentages of global agreement in all domains were greater than 85% in the EORTC QLQ-PR25. All results from equivalence tests were significant, except for Sexual functioning, indicating good equivalence. Only one item exhibited DIF between the two modes. Although nearly 80% of the study patients had no prior computer-use experience, the overall proportion of acceptance and preference for the touch-screen mode were quite high and there was no significant difference across age groups or between computer-use experience groups.The study results showed that the data obtained from the modes of administration were equivalent. The touch-screen mode of administration can be a feasible and suitable alternative to the paper-and-pencil mode for assessment of patient-reported outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552609","annotations":[{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.393081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"China","weight":0.246599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Touchscreen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen"},{"name":"Statistical Methods for Research Workers","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers"},{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Differential item functioning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_item_functioning"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Justice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Rasch model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasch_model"}]}
