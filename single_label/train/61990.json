{"id":61990,"title":"Aortic valve replacement in a patient with pancytopenia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome.","abstract":"The case of a 66-year-old male patient with severe Aortic stenosis who underwent Aortic Valve replacement is presented. This patient was also diagnosed with Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) during admission. The perioperative management was challenging because of associated anaemia, pancytopenia and immunosuppression. These patients also have the tendency to bleed not only due to associated thrombocytopenia but also due to the cardiopulmonary bypass related coagulopathy. A thorough preoperative assessment and intensive preparation of the patient was done before taking him to the operating room. There was an effective communication and cooperation between the surgeon, anaesthetist and haematologist at every stage of management which helped in achieving a successful result.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640815","annotations":[{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.880059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.861098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Aortic valve stenosis","weight":0.797289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_stenosis"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.657751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.514291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pancytopenia","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancytopenia"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.135474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
