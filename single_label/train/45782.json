{"id":45782,"title":"Anticarcinogenic effects of products of heat-processed ginsenoside Re, a major constituent of ginseng berry, on human gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"Ginsenoside Re is a triol type triterpene glycoside and is abundantly present in ginseng berry. In the present study, we verified that ginsenoside Re can be transformed into less-polar ginsenosides, namely, Rg2, Rg6, and F4, by heat-processing. The products of heat-processed ginsenoside Re inhibited phosphorylation of CDK2 at Thr160 by upregulation of p21 level, resulting in S phase arrest. The products of heat-processed ginsenoside Re also activated caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, followed by cleavage of PARP, a substrate of caspase-3, in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, alteration of mitochondrial factors such as Bcl-2 and Bax was also observed. Moreover, pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk abrogated caspase-8, -9, and -3 activations by the products of heat-processed ginsenoside Re. We further confirmed that the anticancer effects of the products of heat-processed ginsenoside Re in AGS cells are mainly mediated via generation of less-polar ginsenosides Rg6 and F4.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666263","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclin-dependent kinase 2","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase_2"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"S phase","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_phase"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.744119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Cyclin-dependent kinase","weight":0.621736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.61722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.609633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.532668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Glycoside","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"Triterpene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triterpene"},{"name":"Ginsenoside","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginsenoside"},{"name":"Berry","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
