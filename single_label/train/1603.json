{"id":1603,"title":"[Induced abortion--clinical problems, regulatory gaps, chaos. How much longer?].","abstract":"Induced abortion is becoming more and more frequent in the contemporary clinical practice. Usually these are pregnant women with diagnosed foetal malformations. Most of them reach a final diagnose in the late second trimester and hence need a pregnancy termination at this gestational age. They are treated in accordance with The Artificial Pregnancy Termination Regulations and put on N 142 clinical-care pathway. The presentation describes the patients' journey form the diagnose through the induced abortion and to the discharge. Analyses the regulations, the multiple inaccuracies and striking omissions with regards to the procedure. Stimulates a discussion on the clinical problems and offers reasonable and realistic solutions.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510039","annotations":[{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.753848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.41087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.165548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.144357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Strike action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"},{"name":"Omission (criminal law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_(criminal_law)"},{"name":"Presentation (obstetrics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_(obstetrics)"},{"name":"Realism (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Chaos theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
