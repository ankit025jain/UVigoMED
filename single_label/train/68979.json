{"id":68979,"title":"Intraoperative monitoring of bladder and internal anal sphincter innervation: a predictor of erectile function following low anterior rectal resection for rectal cancer? Results of a prospective clinical study.","abstract":"The objective was to investigate whether two-dimensional intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of pelvic autonomic nerves has the potential to predict erectile function (EF) following surgery for rectal cancer.A consecutive series of 17 sexually active male rectal cancer patients undergoing IONM-based nerve-sparing low anterior rectal resection were evaluated prospectively. IONM was performed by electric stimulation of the pelvic splanchnic nerves with concomitant electromyography of the internal anal sphincter and cystomanometry. Sexual function was assessed using a validated questionnaire.The degree of agreement between electromyography-based and cystomanometry-based IONM with postoperative EF was moderate and good (? = 0.43 and ? = 0.66). Combined assessment yielded the best agreement (? = 0.76) with sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value of 90%, negative predictive value of 86%, and overall accuracy of 88%, respectively, in terms of prediction of postoperative EF.The method may be suitable to predict male EF following rectal resection.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481247","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.698879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.696177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pelvic splanchnic nerves","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_splanchnic_nerves"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.581261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Splanchnic nerves","weight":0.515028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splanchnic_nerves"},{"name":"Sphincter ani internus muscle","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter_ani_internus_muscle"},{"name":"Erectile tissue","weight":0.212894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_tissue"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0930287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
