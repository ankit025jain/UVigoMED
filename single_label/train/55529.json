{"id":55529,"title":"Femtosecond laser versus manual clear corneal incision in cataract surgery.","abstract":"To compare functional and morphological outcomes of femtosecond laser clear corneal incision (CCI) versus manual CCI during cataract surgery.Sixty eyes of 60 patients who underwent CCI during cataract surgery were randomized into two groups: femtosecond laser CCI (30 eyes) and manual CCI (30 eyes).There were no significant between-group differences in uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, surgically induced astigmatism, and corneal aberrations. Keratometric astigmatism was significantly lower in the femtosecond laser CCI group compared to the manual CCI group at 30 and 180 days (P < .05). Central endothelial cell count was significantly higher in the femtosecond laser CCI group compared to the manual CCI group at 7 and 30 days postoperatively (P < .05). A lower increase of corneal thickness at the incision site was observed at 30 and 180 days postoperatively in the femtosecond laser CCI group compared to the manual CCI group (P < .05). In addition, femtosecond laser CCI showed a better morphology (lower percentage of endothelial and epithelial gaping and endothelial misalignment) compared to manual CCI at different time points. Total phacoemulsification time was significantly lower in the femtosecond laser CCI group (P < .05).The femtosecond laser procedure was safe, efficient, and less damaging, as evidenced by lower central endothelial cell loss, lower increase of corneal thickness at the incision site, and better tunnel morphology compared to the manual technique.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864325","annotations":[{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.877516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.870448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.641308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.557234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.527311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.432028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.348738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.319746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.180731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."}]}
