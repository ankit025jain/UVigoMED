{"id":54324,"title":"Validation of metabolic syndrome score by confirmatory factor analysis in children and adults and prediction of cardiometabolic outcomes in adults.","abstract":"We validated the metabolic syndrome (MetS) score by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in children, middle-aged men, and older women and men and by investigating the relationships of the MetS score to incident type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular and overall death in middle-aged men.We assessed the core features of MetS, calculated the MetS score using z scores for waist circumference, insulin, glucose, triacylglycerols, HDL-cholesterol and blood pressure, and carried out CFA to investigate whether MetS represents a single entity in population samples of 491 children, 1,900 middle-aged men, 614 older women and 555 older men from Finland. We also followed-up incident type 2 diabetes for 11 years and other outcomes for 17-18 years in middle-aged men.We carried out second-order CFAs in which the MetS was represented by a second-order latent variable underlying four latent variables characterised by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and raised blood pressure in different age groups. These second-order factors and factors derived from first-order CFA using previously proposed models were strongly associated with a composite MetS score in all age groups (r?=?0.84-0.94) and similarly predicted type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in middle-aged men. The risk of type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death and overall death increased 3.67-, 1.38-, 1.56- and 1.44-fold, respectively, for a 1 SD increase in the MetS score.The MetS can be described as a single entity in all age groups. The MetS score is a valid tool for research evaluating cardiometabolic risk in different age groups. Further research is needed to define cut-off points for risk estimation in clinical practice.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463933","annotations":[{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.870187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.580601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.476873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.319813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.272572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
