{"id":82175,"title":"Association between cyclooxygenase-2 gene polymorphisms and risk of periodontitis: a meta-analysis involving 5653 individuals.","abstract":"There -765G > C, -1195G > A, and 8473T > C polymorphisms in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene polymorphisms and periodontitis risk were investigated based on published studies; however, their results could not give a conclusive result. Hence, we performed this meta-analysis of six published studies with eight case-control studies including these three polymorphisms which searched from PubMed and Web of Science up to October 15th, 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association between the three polymorphisms of COX-2 and periodontitis risk. The results from 2,580 periodontitis patients and 3,073 healthy controls showed that none of -765G > C, -1195G > A, or 8473T > C polymorphism was not associated with periodontitis susceptibility [Take -765G > C for example: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = (0.57-1.53) for C vs. G; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = (0.72-7.62) for CC vs. GG; OR = 0.68, 95% CI = (0.46-1.01) for CG vs. GG; OR = 0.81, 95% CI = (0.52-1.27) for (CG+GG) vs. GG; OR = 2.57, 95% CI = (0.80-8.29) for CC vs. (GG+CG)]. In subgroup analyses according to the type of periodontitis and ethnicity for -765G > C and -1195G > A, and deviations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for -765G > C, we only observe a boundary association between -1195G > A polymorphism and Asian population. However, due to limitations of this meta-analysis, the results should treat with caution and we suggest the further researches should be carried out to verify our results.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695999","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.451371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.429212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.34434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.148497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Web of Science","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Chemical equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"October 15","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_15"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"1195","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1195"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"580","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/580"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
