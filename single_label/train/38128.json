{"id":38128,"title":"Coexisting bicuspid aortic and pulmonary valves with normally related great vessels diagnosed by live/real time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography.","abstract":"Coexistence of bicuspid aortic and pulmonary valves in the same patient is a very rare entity identified mainly during surgery and postmortem. To the best of our knowledge, only one case has been diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography in a newborn with malposition of the great arteries but no images were presented. Here, we are reporting the first case of bicuspid pulmonary and aortic valves diagnosed by live/real time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography in an adult with normally related great arteries.
