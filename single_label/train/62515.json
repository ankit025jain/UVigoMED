{"id":62515,"title":"Assessment of fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis (by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score) and its relation to disease activity and anemia.","abstract":"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mention fatigue as one of their most annoying problems. Measuring fatigue, understanding its contributory factors, and treating it as a feasible target lead to better patient outcome and improved quality of life. The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System is a collection of health-related quality-of-life questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness.The objective of this study was to evaluate fatigue using FACIT-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score and its relation to disease activity (using Disease Activity Score [DAS28] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score) and anemia in RA patients.A total of 100 RA patients were evaluated for fatigue using FACIT-F score, for disease activity using DAS28 and CDAI scores, for anemia using hemoglobin levels. Correlation studies were done using Pearson test.Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue showed positive association with DAS28 (P < 0.001; r = -0.80) and CDAI (P < 0.001; r = -0.83). Considering various components of DAS28 and CDAI, FACIT-F showed significant correlation with tender joint count (P < 0.001; r = -0.73), swollen joint count (P < 0.001; r = -0.76), patient global assessment (P < 0.001; r = -0.72), and evaluator global assessment (P < 0.001; r = -0.75). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate had no association with the fatigue (P = 0.217). No association was observed between fatigue and hemoglobin levels (P = 0.203).The fatigue experienced by the patients with RA is strongly associated with the severity of disease activity and is independent of anemia.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561411","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.774674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.542599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.37766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.360229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Facit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facit"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
