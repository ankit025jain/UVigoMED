{"id":67765,"title":"Transperineal ultrasound-guided 12-core prostate biopsy: an extended approach to diagnose transition zone prostate tumors.","abstract":"Transperineal ultrasound-guided (TPUS) 12-core prostate biopsy was evaluated as an initial strategy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, The distribution of prostate cancer lesions was assessed with zone-specific biopsy.From January 2010 to December 2012, 287 patients underwent TPUS-guided 12-core prostate biopsy. Multiple cores were obtained from both the peripheral zone (PZ) and the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate. Participants' clinical data and the diagnostic yield of the cores were recorded and prospectively analyzed as a cross-sectional study.The diagnostic yield of the 12-core prostate biopsy was significantly higher compared to the 6-core scheme (42.16 vs. 21.6%). The diagnostic yield of the 10-core prostate biopsy was significantly higher compared to the 6-core scheme (37.6 vs. 21.6%). The 12-core scheme improved the diagnostic yield in prostates >50 ml (12-core scheme: 28.1% vs. 10-core scheme: 20.4%; p = 0.034).The 12-core biopsy scheme is a safe and effective approach for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. TZ biopsies in patients with larger prostates should be included in the initial biopsy strategy.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586569","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.589984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.405052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Transitioning (transgender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Giulia_TZ"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Province of Potenza","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Potenza"},{"name":"Arizona transition zone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_transition_zone"}]}
