{"id":52700,"title":"High oleic/stearic fatty-acid desaturation index in cord plasma from infants of mothers with gestational diabetes.","abstract":"Enhanced fatty-acid desaturation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme-1 (SCD1) is associated with obesity. This study determined desaturation in the cord plasma of newborns of mothers with and without gestational diabetes (GDM).Newborns of mothers with GDM (n=21) and without (control, n=22) were recruited. Cord plasma fatty-acid desaturation indices (palmitoleic/palmitic, oleic/stearic ratios) were compared, and correlated with anthropometrics and biochemical measures. A subset of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) desaturation indices were determined to approximate the liver SCD1 activity.The total oleic/stearic index was higher in GDM, despite adjustment for cord glucose concentrations. Among GDM and controls, the oleic/stearic index correlated with cord glucose concentrations (rs=0.36, P=0.02). Both palmitoleic/palmitic and oleic/stearic indices correlated with waist circumference (r=0.47, P=0.001; r=0.37, P=0.01). The VLDL oleic/stearic index was higher in GDM.The elevated total oleic/stearic index suggests increased lipogenesis in GDM newborns. Factors in addition to glucose supply may influence fetal SCD1 activity.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577432","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.715256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Very low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.515504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Lipogenesis","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogenesis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Fatty acid desaturase","weight":0.196184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_desaturase"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cord Automobile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_Automobile"},{"name":"Doctor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Science"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"GNOME Display Manager","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager"}]}
