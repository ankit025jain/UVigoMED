{"id":67342,"title":"Assessment of adequacy of hemodialysis dose at a Palestinian hospital.","abstract":"Adequacy of hemodialysis improves patient survival, quality of life and biochemical outcomes and minimizes disease complications and hospitalizations. This study was an observational cross-sectional study that was conducted in July 2012. Blood tests, weight and blood pressure were measured before and after hemodialysis. Single-pool Kt/V and urea reduction ratio (URR) were calculated. The targets based on the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines were Kt/V ? 1.2 and URR ? 65%. Of the 64 patients, 41 (64.1%) were males. The mean age of the patients was 58.13 ± 17.2 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.04 ± 5.01 kg/m 2 . The mean Kt/V and URR were 1.06 ± 0.05 and 54.4 ± 19.3, respectively. There was no significant difference between men and women (1.06 ± 0.47 versus 1.04 ± 0.55, P = 0.863) and (54.7 ± 19.59 versus 53.81 ± 19.17, P = 0.296). Only 25 (39.1%) patients achieved the Kt/V goal and only 22 (34.4%) had target URR, and there was no significant association between hemodialysis adequacy and any of the variables such as sex, age, presence of chronic diseases or BMI. Serum potassium levels post-dialysis were significantly lower in patients who reached the target Kt/V (mean = 3.44 ± 0.48 versus 3.88 ± 0.48, P = 0.001). Most patients were inadequately dialyzed and a large percentage of the patients did not attain the targets. Attempts to achieve the desired goals are necessary. It is important to calculate Kt/V or URR and individualize the dialysis doses for each patient.
