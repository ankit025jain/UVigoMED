{"id":82510,"title":"Specific forms of BAFF favor BAFF receptor-mediated epithelial cell survival.","abstract":"Although B cell activating factor (BAFF) and its receptor BR3 are produced and expressed by many cells, their role has been restricted to the lymphocyte lineage. Using various techniques (RT-PCR, indirect immunofluorescence, flow cytometry analysis), we observed the expression of BR3 and the production of BAFF by the human salivary gland cell line, by epithelial cells from biopsies of Sjögren's syndrome patients and their controls, but also by salivary gland epithelial cells in culture. To decipher the role of BAFF and BR3 on epithelial cells, BAFF and BR3 were neutralized by blocking antibodies or RNA specific inhibitor (siBR3) and epithelial cell survival was analyzed. Blocking BR3 promotes epithelial cell apoptosis in vitro. This apoptosis resulted in the nuclear translocation of PKC?. BAFF neutralization by various anti-BAFF antibodies leads to different effects depending on the antibody used suggesting that only some forms of BAFF are required for epithelial cell survival. Our study demonstrates that BR3 is involved in the survival of cultured epithelial cells due to an autocrine effect of BAFF. It also suggests that epithelial cells produce different forms of BAFF and that only some of them are responsible for this effect.
