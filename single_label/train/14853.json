{"id":14853,"title":"Labda-8(17),12,14-trien-19-oic acid contained in fruits of Cupressus sempervirens suppresses benign prostatic hyperplasia in rat and in vitro human models through inhibition of androgen and STAT-3 signaling.","abstract":"Fruit extract of Cupressus sempervirens (CS), which is used traditionally to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)-like urinary symptoms in patients, was scientifically validated for anti-BPH activity. The ethanolic fruit extract of CS inhibited proliferation of human BPH-stromal cells and the activity was localized to its chloroform-soluble, diterpene-rich fraction. Eight major diterpenes isolated from this fraction exhibited moderate to potent activity and the most active diterpene (labda-8(17),12,14-trien-19-oic acid) exhibited an IC50 of 37.5??M (antiproliferative activity against human BPH-stromal cells). It significantly inhibited activation (phosphorylation) of Stat-3 in BPH-stromal cells and prevented transactivation of androgen sensitive KLK3/PSA and TMPRSS2 genes in LNCaP cells. Labda-8(17),12,14-trien-19-oic acid-rich CS fraction prevented prostatic hyperplasia in rat model and caused TUNEL labeling of stromal cells with lower expressions of IGF-I, TGF-ÃŸ and PCNA, and bcl-2/bax ratio. Human BPH tissues exhibited precise lowering of stromal component after incubation in labda-8(17),12,14-trien-19-oic acid, ex vivo. We conclude that labda-8(17),12,14-trien-19-oic acid contained in CS exhibits anti-BPH activity through inhibition of stromal proliferation and suppression of androgen action in the prostate, presenting a unique lead structure for further optimization of anti-BPH activity.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399792","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.744124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.652961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"LNCaP","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNCaP"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.364652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"TMPRSS2","weight":0.3325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPRSS2"},{"name":"Terpene","weight":0.288682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene"},{"name":"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proliferating_cell_nuclear_antigen"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.265891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.244683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"}]}
