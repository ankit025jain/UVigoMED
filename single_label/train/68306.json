{"id":68306,"title":"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and hyperuricemia in relation to renal impairment in a rural Japanese population: the Nagasaki Islands study.","abstract":"The influence of hyperuricemia on atherosclerosis is controversial. Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis can be defined in two ways in terms of mean and maximum carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT): one with mean CIMT?1.1 mm and the other with maximum CIMT?1.1 mm. However, no studies have been reported of the association between hyperuricemia and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis while taking the two different ways of classification into account.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 4133 subjects (1492 men and 2641 women) aged 30-89 years undergoing general health check-ups. For analysis of various associations, we calculated the multivariable odds ratios (ORs) for the two ways classifications of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in relation to hyperuricemia.Hyperuricemia-related renal impairment constitutes a significant marker for subclinical carotid atherosclerosis with mean CIMT?1.1 mm for both men and women, while hyperuricemia per se was found to be beneficially associated with risk of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis with maximum CIMT?1.1 mm for men. The classical cardiovascular risk factors without adjustment for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ORs for subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (mean CIMT?1.1 mm) and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (maximum CIMT?1.1 mm) were 2.20(1.10-4.22) and 0.84(0.63-1.13) for men and 2.12(1.02-4.38) and 0.92(0.66-1.27) for women. After further adjustment for GFR, the corresponding values were 1.54(0.74-3.20) and 0.67(0.49-0.92) for men and 1.32(0.61-2.88) and 0.80(0.57-1.12) for women.Hyperuricemia-related renal impairment is a significant marker for subclinical carotid atherosclerosis for both men and women, while hyperuricemia per se may be inversely associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis for men as seen in a rural community-dwelling Japanese population.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Male Urogenital
