{"id":91196,"title":"Esophageal perforation management using a multidisciplinary minimally invasive treatment algorithm.","abstract":"The surgical management of esophageal perforation (EP) often results in mortality and significant morbidity. Recent less invasive approaches to EP management include endoscopic luminal stenting and minimally invasive surgical therapies. We wished to establish therapeutic efficacy of minimally invasive therapies in a consecutive series of patients.An IRB-approved retrospective review of all acute EPs between 2007 and 2013 at a single institution was performed. Patient demographic, clinical outcomes data, and hospital charges were collected.We reviewed 76 consecutive patients with acute EP presenting to our tertiary care center. Median age was 64 Â± 16 years (range 25 to 87 years), with 50 men and 26 women. Ninety percent of EPs were in the distal esophagus, with 67% of iatrogenic perforations occurring within 4 cm of the gastroesophageal junction. All patients were treated within 24 hours of initial presentation with a removable covered esophageal stent. Leak occlusion was confirmed within 48 hours of esophageal stent placement in 68 patients. Median lengths of ICU and hospital stay were 3 and 10 days, respectively (range 1 to 86 days). One-third of the patients were noted to have prolonged intubation (>7 days) and pneumonia that required a tracheostomy. One in-hospital (1.3%) mortality occurred within 30 days. Median total hospital charges for EP were $85,945.Endoscopically placed removable esophageal stents with minimally invasive repair of the perforation and feeding access is an effective treatment method for patients with EP. This multidisciplinary method enabled us to care for severely ill patients while minimizing morbidity and mortality and avoiding open esophageal surgery.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529810","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.761552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.636749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.484501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Boerhaave syndrome","weight":0.258841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerhaave_syndrome"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
