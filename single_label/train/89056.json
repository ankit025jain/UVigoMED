{"id":89056,"title":"Comment: importance of cognitive reserve in traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"The expectation for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is permanent damage and lasting deficits. However, in a multicenter investigation, Schneider et al.(1) show that by 1 year postinjury, one-fourth of patients with TBI achieve disability-free recovery (DFR), defined as a score of zero on the Disability Rating Scale. Of importance, cognitive reserve (CR) in the form of educational attainment was related to DFR.
