{"id":79190,"title":"Glucocorticoids in laryngology: a review.","abstract":"To provide the otolaryngologist an evidence-based sound review of glucocorticoid use for laryngeal pathology.Review of contemporary peer-reviewed literature as well as review articles.A review of the literature regarding glucocorticoids as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of benign laryngeal pathology and laryngeal manifestations of systemic disease was performed. Review included both systemic administration as well as local injection.Glucocorticoids, administered in the critical care setting for planned extubation, markedly reducing the risk of reintubation and remain a rudimentary pharmacologic adjunct in laryngeal manifestations of common autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Intralesional injection has reduced the rate of surgical intervention for benign inflammatory primary laryngeal pathology.Glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of a number of laryngeal pathologies, through both systemic and intralesional administration. However, a clear consensus for utilization of glucocorticoids in the treatment of specific laryngeal disorders has yet to be published.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474440","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.712232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.511784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Laryngology","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.229542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"}]}
