{"id":54312,"title":"Integrated community-healthcare diabetes interventions to reduce disparities.","abstract":"Racial and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. With the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) under the Affordable Care Act, healthcare organizations may have an increased motivation to implement interventions that collaborate with community resources and organizations. As a result, there will be an increasing need for evidence-based strategies that integrate healthcare and community components to reduce diabetes disparities. This paper summarizes the types of community/health system partnerships that have been implemented over the past several years to improve minority health and reduce disparities among racial/ethnic minorities and describes the components that are most commonly integrated. In addition, we provide our recommendations for creating stronger healthcare and community partnerships through enhanced community support.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464339","annotations":[{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Accountability","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.276152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.223438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.205164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0929335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Racial integration","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_integration"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"}]}
