{"id":17653,"title":"Ultra-low power laser stimulation impairs the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to primary human cells, and interferes with the expression of staphylococcal pathogenic factors.","abstract":"Lasers are commonly used in several fields of medicine as a complementary therapy for internal medicine, surgery and also diagnostics. The efficacy of ultra-low level laser therapy (ULLLT) at power levels around 0.15 mW/cm(2) has been demonstrated both in in vitro experiments and in the clinical environment. This work used an ULLLT laser source to analyze its efficacy on Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to cells and on its ability to produce pathogenic factors. Laser stimulation succeeded in impairing the binding of S. aureus to primary human cells in culture and in inhibiting the expression of coagulase, one of the main staphylococcal pathogenic factors. The importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the modification of the ECM redox potential in these activities were also evidenced.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858646","annotations":[{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.83222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.755162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.696914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.660924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.602129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.401644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.394015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.139479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.119479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Reduction potential","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_potential"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"}]}
