{"id":32655,"title":"[Senning operation as a method of treatment of the main vessels transposition].","abstract":"Results of performance of Senning operation for the main vessels transposition were analyzed. Analysis of complications, lethality in early postoperative period and of far-remote results was conducted. The systemic right ventricle function in patients after Senning operation was estimated. Not high level of early and late postoperative lethality was established. Clinical state of patients in far-remote postoperative period was good. A systemic right ventricle function was estimated as satisfactory.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923111","annotations":[{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
