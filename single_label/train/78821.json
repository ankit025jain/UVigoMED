{"id":78821,"title":"Pollen count and presentation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema.","abstract":"The incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema is increased in patients with seasonal allergies.We tested the hypothesis that patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema present during months when pollen counts are increased.Cohort analysis examined the month of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema and pollen counts in the ambulatory and hospital setting. Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema were ascertained through (1) an observational study of patients presenting to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, (2) patients presenting to the Marshfield Clinic and participating in the Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project, and (3) patients enrolled in The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). Measurements include date of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, population exposure to ACE inhibitor by date, and local pollen counts by date.At Vanderbilt, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with tree pollen months (P = .01 from ?(2) test). When separate analyses were conducted in patients with a history of seasonal allergies and patients without, the rate of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema was increased during tree pollen months only in patients with a history of seasonal allergies (P = .002). In Marshfield, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with ragweed pollen months (P = .025). In ONTARGET, a positive trend was observed between the ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema rate and grass season, although it was not statistically significant (P = .057).Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema are more likely to present with this adverse drug event during months when pollen counts are increased.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565618","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.898537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"ACE inhibitor","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.514787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.451568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.362539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.356784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.286341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Angioedema","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.144639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Telmisartan","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmisartan"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.044522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Vanderbilt University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University"},{"name":"Ragweed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragweed"},{"name":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center"},{"name":"Marshfield Clinic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshfield_Clinic"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Grass","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Endpoint (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_(band)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Ramipril","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramipril"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Pollen count","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen_count"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"}]}
