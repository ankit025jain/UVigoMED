{"id":63661,"title":"Study on the association between the Arg194Trp polymorphism in the XRCC1 gene and the risk of hematological malignancies.","abstract":"The association between the Arg194Trp polymorphism in the XRCC1 gene and the risk of hematological malignancies has been extensively investigated. However, the results were inconsistent. The objective of the current study is to investigate the association by meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and Weipu databases, covering all studies until Aug. 7, 2013. Statistical analysis was performed by using the RevMan4.2 software and the Stata10.0 software. A total of 20 case-control studies concerning the Arg194Trp polymorphism were indentified from 19 articles. In total analysis, our results suggested that the Arg194Trp polymorphism was not associated with an increased/decreased risk of hematological malignancies (odds ratio (OR)?= 1.01, 95 % confidence interval (CI)?= 0.85-1.22, P = 0.87 for Arg/Trp+Trp/Trp vs. Arg/Arg). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association was found either among Asians (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.84-1.29, P = 0.72) or among Europeans (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.72-1.49, P = 0.83); in the subgroup analyses by cancer types, no significant association was found either among leukemia (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.89-1.35, P = 0.39) or in lymphoma (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.57-1.22, P = 0.35). The current meta-analysis indicated that the Arg194Trp polymorphism in the XRCC1 gene might be not a risk factor for hematological malignancies. In the future, more large-scale case-control studies are needed to validate these results.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414482","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.83483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.777919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.587502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.467264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.196702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"XRCC1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRCC1"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"841","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/841"},{"name":"891","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/891"},{"name":"851","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/851"},{"name":"721","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/721"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
