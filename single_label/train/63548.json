{"id":63548,"title":"Comparison of cutaneous sarcoidosis with systemic sarcoidosis: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"To investigate clinical characteristics and treatment effect of sarcoidosis with cutaneous lesions in Chinese patients, and to compare them with previous works.Retrospective analysis was conducted based on clinical manifestations, systemic examinations and treatment of biopsy-proved 36 patients with sarcoidosis with cutaneous lesions in our hospital since 2000. Patients were divided into cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS) group without systemic involvement and systemic sarcoidosis (SS) group with systemic involvement according to whether extracutaneous systems were involved.Male to female ratio was 1:4.1 in total 36 patients. Average age of onset was (43.6±15.8) years old in CS group and (54.4±11.5) years old in SS group. The most common cutaneous lesions were papulonodules (41.7%) and frequently found in limbs (61.1%). There were 26 patients in SS group, and lung was the most common organ with systemic involvement, followed by lymph nodes. In SS group, elevation of inflammatory parameters and evident changes of chest radiologic examination were often observed. 72.2% patients were treated with glucocorticoid and the overall therapeutic efficacy rate was 48.4%. The therapeutic efficacy in CS group (80%) was significantly higher than SS group (33.3%). Papulonodules type had better response to therapy and usually resolved after treatment. Lupus pernio type was resistant to treatment.Sarcoidosis occurs more frequently in females. Lung is the most commonly affected extracutaneous organ in SS patients. CS patients have better response to therapy than SS patients. Types of cutaneous lesions and existence of systemic involvement are related to prognosis of cutaneous lesions.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24427359","annotations":[{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.740728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.543255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.291152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Lupus pernio","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_pernio"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
