{"id":91445,"title":"Laparoscopic myomectomy: a 6-year follow-up single-center cohort analysis of fertility and obstetric outcome measures.","abstract":"To evaluate fertility, pregnancy and delivery outcomes after laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) during long-term follow-up.In this single-center retrospective observational study, data were analyzed from 59 women aged 23-42 years with the desire to have children and who underwent LM for symptomatic uterine leiomyoma between January 2001 and December 2006 and subsequently delivered at our hospital.During a mean follow-up period of 73.55 months, the post-LM conception rate was 68 %. The proportion of miscarriages (n = 16) among all pregnancies (n = 55) was lower after (24 %) than before (43 %) LM. Thirty-nine (46 %) deliveries were primary cesarean sections (CSs). CS was performed due to patients' preference, placental complications, and uterine rupture (UR). Labor was successful in 62 % of all vaginal delivery trials. UR and placental complications occurred in 10 and 13 % of all pregnancies, respectively.LM reduced the abortion rate and increased the CS rate in our cohort. UR risk may have been affected by suturing technique, the size and location of myomas removed.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504422","annotations":[{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Uterine rupture","weight":0.850585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_rupture"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.692299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.560053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.532187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Uterine myomectomy","weight":0.458136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_myomectomy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Vaginal delivery","weight":0.322344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_delivery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.157055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Australian Labor Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
