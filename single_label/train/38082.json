{"id":38082,"title":"A 6-week-old boy with annular skin lesions. Neonatal lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"A 6-week-old, otherwise healthy boy presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of an eruption involving his scalp, face, and trunk. The truncal lesions had been present for several weeks, and the facial and scalp lesions were noticed 5 days prior to presentation. The eruption was asymptomatic without scratching or discomfort noted by his mother. Past medical history was remarkable for preterm delivery due to maternal hypertension during pregnancy. The infant was thriving and gaining weight appropriately. There was no family history of cutaneous or autoimmune disease. No one in the family had a recent tinea infection. On physical exam, he was a well-appearing, vigorous infant. There were multiple erythematous papules and annular plaques involving his left pre-auricular and post-auricular areas, scalp, upper chest, and right abdominal wall (Figures 1 and 2). No other cutaneous or mucus membrane lesions were noted. His cardiac, lung, and abdominal exams were normal.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450316","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.793125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.699639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.592441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.524765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.497093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Neonatal lupus erythematosus","weight":0.0439684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Tinea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Volcano","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"}]}
