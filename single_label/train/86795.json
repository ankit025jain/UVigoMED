{"id":86795,"title":"[Anti-angiogenic agents of lung cancer].","abstract":"Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor growth; therefore, inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising treatment strategy. Many signaling pathways, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)pathway, the Notch pathway, and the integrin pathway, are associated with each other in a complex manner; the VEGF signaling pathway plays a central role in angiogenesis. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets VEGF-A. Two large phase III trials, ECOG4599 and the AVAiL study, showed that bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Based on these results, bevacizumab is currently the only anti-angiogenic agent approved as the first-line of treatment for advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in Japan. Many anti-angiogenic agents are currently in clinical development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. These agents show antitumor activity by binding to a ligand and inhibiting the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. However, bevacizumab is currently the only agent that extends overall survival. This review mainly discusses the results of a recent phase III trial with bevacizumab. We also discuss the results of a recent trial with new anti-angiogenic agents.
