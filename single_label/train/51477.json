{"id":51477,"title":"GABARBP down-regulates HIF-1? expression through the VEGFR-2 and PI3K/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathways.","abstract":"Human ?-aminobutyrate type A (GABAA) receptor-binding protein (GABARBP), a tumor suppressor protein with apoptotic function, can be inhibited in response to angiogenesis through the PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Here, we investigated whether GABARBP over-expression could regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) expression and angiogenic activity in a carcinoma model system. GABARBP dramatically inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in vitro. At the same time, GABARBP exposed potent anti-angiogenic activity and remarkably down-regulated the levels of VEGF and HIF-1? protein expression, key components for angiogenesis. In addressing its biological molecular mechanism, GABARBP was found to effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of down-stream PI3K components, such as PDK1, Akt, mTOR, TSC-2, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 by directly binding with VEGFR-2. In contrast, p38/JNK phosphorylation was not suppressed by GABARBP. These findings disclose a novel function of GABARBP in suppressing VEGF and HIF-1? protein expression, which is important for tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. Thus, our data strongly provides novel biological mechanistic insights into the regulatory function of GABARBP in ovarian tumor progression, and the important of pre-clinical certification of GABARBP as a potential angiogenesis agent targeting ovarian tumorigenesis.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System
