{"id":78219,"title":"[Epidemiological investigation and related risk factors analysis of allergic rhinitis in primary and middle school students in Changsha].","abstract":"To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and related risk factors of allergic rhinitis in primary and middle school students in Changsha so that to provide the scientific basis for the disease control and intervention.From June 2011 to April 2012, we randomly chose primary and middle school students aged from 10 to 17 years old in Changsha as our research objects. Through stratified sampling and cluster sampling, we carried out epidemiological investigation using questionnaire investigation, physical examination and skin prick test. After statistical analysis of the data,we explored the related risk factors.(1) 7,023 copies of questionnaire were sent out and 6,407 copies of valid questionnaire were received in the stratified sampling survey. The prevalence of complaining about having got allergic rhinitis is 44.6% while the real rates is 20.5%; (2) 814 research objects were investigated in cluster sampling survey. The result of the incidence of allergic rhinitis is 26.3%, and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis is 17.2%. Analysis of Visual Analog Scale Questionnaire showed significant influence of allergic rhinitis on students character, memory, sleep quality, etc.The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in primary and middle school students aged at 10-17 years old in Changsha is 17%-20%. The occurrence and development of allergic rhinitis is related to environment, genetic background and living habits. Allergic rhinitis influenced the students' character, memory and sleep quality significantly.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738311","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.67656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.489076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.422521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Stratified sampling","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.330791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.2827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"School","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.154443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.128079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Cluster sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Post-hoc analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hoc_analysis"},{"name":"Analog Science Fiction and Fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"}]}
