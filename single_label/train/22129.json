{"id":22129,"title":"[Impact of continuous blood purification on T cell subsets in children with severe sepsis].","abstract":"To investigate the impact of continuous blood purification (CBP) on T-cell subsets and prognosis in children with severe sepsis.A total of 42 children with severe sepsis were randomly divided into a control group (n=22) and a CBP group (n=20). The patients in the control group received conventional treatment, while those in the CBP group underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration daily 12-24 hours for 3 days besides conventional treatment. Changes in clinical variables and in peripheral blood regulatory T cell subsets were assessed 3 and 7 days after treatment.The pediatric intensive care unit length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were significantly shortened and the 28-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the CPB treatment group as compared with the control group (P<0.05). In the CBP treatment group, the percentage of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) T cell populations and PCIS scores were significantly higher at 3 and 7 days after treatment than before treatment (P<0.05). At 7 days after treatment, the percentage of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) T cell populations, CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio and PCIS scores were significantly higher in the CBP group than in the control group (P<0.05).The CBP treatment may counteract the suppression of immune function and thus improve prognosis in children with severe sepsis.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
