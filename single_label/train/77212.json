{"id":77212,"title":"Decreased gastric body mucosa obestatin expression in abdominal obesity patients with normal body mass index.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate whether the expression of obestatin in gastric body mucosa in abdominal obesity patients with normal body mass index (BMI) is different compared with healthy controls. Twenty abdominal obesity patients with normal BMI and twenty healthy controls were included in the study. The number of obestatin-positive cells in gastric body mucosa was significantly lower in abdominal obesity patients with normal BMI than that in healthy subjects. There was a positive correlation between the numbers of obestatin-positive cells in the gastric body mucosa and plasma obestatin levels in abdominal obesity subjects and control group.
