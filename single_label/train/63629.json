{"id":63629,"title":"Clinical characteristics of 95 patients with ocular adnexal and uveal lymphoma: treatment outcomes in extranodal marginal zone subtype.","abstract":"Lymphoma rarely presents in the ocular adnexa but is usually extranodal marginal zone (ENMZ) lymphoma when it does. Involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) is the standard of care for unilateral disease, but the optimal management of more extensive disease is unclear.We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 95 patients with ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) or uveal lymphoma treated or diagnosed at our institution. All patients identified were included in the risk factor analysis for progression-free survival (PFS). The initial treatment-related outcomes were assessed for ENMZ OAL only (n = 62).With a median follow-up of 32 months, significant risk factors for PFS after initial treatment were age (hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.74), female gender (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.00), and a history of lymphoma (hazard ratio, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-4.78). In ENMZ, IFRT was associated with improved PFS (median, 5.4 years; P < .001). Progression occurred in 7 of 39 (23%), with 6 of the 7 (86%) at systemic sites. Single-agent rituximab was typically used for bilateral ocular or systemic presentations of ENMZ OAL. Progression occurred in 7 of 11 (64%), with no progression at systemic sites. All progression events in those initially treated with rituximab occurred in the ocular adnexa.The results of the present study have confirmed IFRT as the standard for unilateral ENMZ OAL. Single-agent rituximab was an effective agent for bilateral ocular or systemic ENMZ OAL, particularly for systemic control, but ocular progression should be closely monitored. Combined modality therapy should be studied further in bilateral and systemic ENMZ OAL.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417911","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.778803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.678104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.434906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.361574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.335355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Marginal zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_zone"},{"name":"Accessory visual structures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_visual_structures"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Uvea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvea"},{"name":"Ordre des Arts et des Lettres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordre_des_Arts_et_des_Lettres"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"}]}
