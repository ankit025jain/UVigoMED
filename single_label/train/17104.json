{"id":17104,"title":"The use of tetanus post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines by general practitioners and emergency departments in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional questionnaire study.","abstract":"The Dutch National Immunisation Programme includes six tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccinations and reaches a high rate of vaccination coverage. In the Netherlands, several guidelines related to tetanus post-exposure prophylaxis (T-PEP) are in place. In 2003, the Dutch Health Council (HC) reviewed the use of T-PEP. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the HC recommendations have been implemented.We asked 178 Dutch General Practitioner (GP) offices and 60 Emergency Departments (EDs) to participate in a cross-sectional questionnaire study and requested that participating facilities send in the T-PEP guidelines adopted by their practice. The differences, based on categories mentioned in the HC recommendations, between GPs and EDs and the type of T-PEP guidelines adopted were assessed.The response rates for the GPs and EDs were 38% (n=67) and 70% (n=42), respectively. 98% percent (n=107) of the participants reported having T-PEP guidelines. Of the guidelines described in the survey responses, 28% (n=23; EDs 41%, GPs 21%) were consistent with the HC-recommendations, 36% (n=29; EDs 7%, GPs 52%) adhered to the guidelines of the College of GPs (CGP), which restricts the use of T-PEP to tetanus prone wounds but for these wounds is in line with the recommendations of the HC. The remaining 36% had adopted other guidelines, most of which can lead to over-prescription of T-PEP. Information on T-PEP was lacking in patients with higher risk vaccination histories.Almost all participants have adopted T-PEP guidelines. Strict adherence to the HC recommendations is low. More than half of GPs have adopted the more restrictive CGP-guideline, which limits T-PEP to tetanus prone wounds.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910158","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.813666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.704453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.693187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.608132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.441137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tetanus","weight":0.172756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Post-exposure prophylaxis","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-exposure_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Toxoid","weight":0.0527282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoid"},{"name":"Tetanus toxoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus_toxoid"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Computervision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computervision"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Isle of Man TT","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_TT"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
