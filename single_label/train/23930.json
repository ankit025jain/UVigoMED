{"id":23930,"title":"A novel synthetic dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan analog XLYF-104-6 attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in RAW264.7 macrophage cells and protects BALB/c mice from sepsis.","abstract":"The wide range of inflammation mechanisms under control by NF-?B makes this pathway as an attractive target for new anti-inflammatory drugs. Herein, we showed that a new dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan analog XLYF-104-6, with a chemical name of 1,2,3,10,11-pentamethoxydibenzocycloocta-6,7-[c] pyrrole-1,3-dione, inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-?B activation in RAW264.7 cells through preventing I?B? degradation and p65 nuclear translocation. The inhibitory activity of this compound on NF-?B activation contributes to the reduction of LPS-induced TNF-? and IL-6 productions. Notably, XLYF-104-6 suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production in a NF-?B independent manner, since IKK inhibitor BAY 11-7082 has failed to exert similar inhibitory effect on iNOS expression and NO production. In addition, XLFY-104-6 also exerted anti-inflammatory action in endotoxemic mice by decreasing plasma LPS-induced TNF-? and IL-1? levels as well as increasing plasma LPS-induced IL-10 concentrations. These findings suggest XLYF-104-6 could act as a leading compound for developing a potential anti-inflammatory drug.
