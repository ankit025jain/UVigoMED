{"id":91834,"title":"Posterior capsule rupture, iridodialysis, hyphema, and macular hole after blunt ocular trauma.","abstract":"A 34-year-old man was examined 4 hours after blunt ocular trauma with a stone. Visual acuity was hand motions in the right eye and 10/10 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination after resorption of a hyphema revealed 180? superior iridodialysis and a total white intumescent cataract precluding visualization of the posterior capsule. Phacoemulsification was undertaken after repositioning the iris with microretractors. Intraoperatively, we discovered that the cen-tral portion of the posterior capsule presented a 4-mm oval opening with thick and fibrosed edges. The posterior chamber lens was safely implanted in the bag with no enlargement of the posterior capsule rupture. Postoperatively, VA improved only to 1/20 and fundus OCT revealed the presence of a 400-micron, oval-shaped macular hole that was successfully closed with sub-sequent vitrectomy and gas tamponade. Visual acuity stabilized at 5/10, D3, and the lens was stable without decentration after 36 months follow-up.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471167","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.563654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.376164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Iridodialysis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridodialysis"},{"name":"Posterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Micrometre","weight":0.243561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre"},{"name":"Hyphema","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphema"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intumescent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intumescent"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"1010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1010"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Oval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval"},{"name":"Tamponade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamponade"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorption"},{"name":"A34 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A34_autoroute"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"}]}
