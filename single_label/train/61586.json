{"id":61586,"title":"Glue granuloma following laparoscopic hernia repair.","abstract":"Minimal inflammation of tissues can occur following skin closure with a foreign material. This foreign body reaction can lead to granuloma formation. We report the case of a middle-aged man who, having undergone laparoscopic surgery and had the port site wounds closed with skin glue, was detected to have a non-healing wound. A crystal mass protruding from the incision site was confirmed histologically as a chronic granulomatous reaction to skin glue. A foreign body granulomatous reaction to skin glue has not been described in the literature.
