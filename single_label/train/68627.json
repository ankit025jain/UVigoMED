However, the histologic features of latent IgA deposition have not been fully characterized.To better identify the clinicopathologic background of subclinical mesangial IgA deposition, we compared the clinical and histologic characteristics of long-term functioning kidney allografts with and without latent IgA deposition.Among 29 patients with a posttransplant duration of >10 years, 37.9% exhibited latent mesangial IgA deposition. Biopsies indicated that renal function at the time of and 5 years before subclinical mesangial IgA deposition was generally similar. HLA-DR4 and HLA-Bw51 showed a nonsignificant trend to be more frequent in the IgA-positive group. Histologic investigation demonstrated no changes in disease scores based on the Banff 2009 classification between groups. Immunofluorescence revealed co-deposition of C3 at >1+ intensity in 72% IgA-positive patients. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that IgA deposition per se did not cause notable increases in intraglomerular ?-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive cells. One patient with subclinical IgA deposition demonstrated a waxing and waning pattern in the amount of IgA deposition.This study suggests that subclinical IgA deposition in long-term functioning kidney allografts is not associated with progressive course in clinical and pathologic findings. Furthermore, the amount of subclinical IgA deposition may exhibit fluctuating patterns in some cases.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507037","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.810683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mesangium","weight":0.113797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesangium"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"}]}
