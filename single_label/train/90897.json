{"id":90897,"title":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a risk factor for concussions in NCAA division-I athletes.","abstract":"Sports-related concussions are associated with both acute and long-term consequences. Past work has identified novel risk factors and modifiers for concussions, including mood and neuropsychiatric disorders. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder that may also contribute to concussion risk, although no study has examined this possibility.One hundred and thirty-nine NCAA Division-I athletes at Kent State University (KSU) self-reported a history of prior concussion and diagnostic history of ADHD as part of a larger concussion management programme at KSU.ADHD was prevalent (10.1%) and 18.0% of the sample reported a prior history of at least one concussion injury. 50.4% of athletes with ADHD reported a history of at least one prior concussion vs 14.4% of athletes without ADHD, which represented a significant difference (p?<?0.01). Analyses showed that athletes with ADHD were more likely to report a past history of concussions than those without ADHD (F?(1,133)?=?4.31, p?=?0.04).ADHD is prevalent in NCAA Division-I athletes and associated with history of past concussions. If replicated, these findings could have important implications in the prevention and management of concussions in athletes with ADHD.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564766","annotations":[{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.805162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.619035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.59545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.476917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.469809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.357647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.26699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.210088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"History","weight":0.161283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Kent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent"},{"name":"Kent State University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University"},{"name":"National Collegiate Athletic Association","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"ADHD predominantly inattentive","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"1334","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1334"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Grammatical modifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_modifier"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Disorder (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(band)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"}]}
