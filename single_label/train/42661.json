{"id":42661,"title":"Upper abdominal gadoxetic acid-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI for the detection of gastric cancer: Comparison with two-dimensional multidetector row CT.","abstract":"To evaluate the diagnostic performance of abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of gastric cancer in comparison with that of two-dimensional (2D) multidetector row computed tomography (CT).The study included 189 patients with 170 surgically confirmed gastric cancers and 19 patients without gastric cancer, all of whom underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, and multidetector contrast-enhanced abdominal CT imaging. Two observers independently analysed three sets of images (CT set, conventional MRI set, and combined conventional and DW MRI set). A five-point scale for likelihood of gastric cancer was used. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were evaluated. Quantitative [apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) analyses with Mann-Whitney U-test were conducted for gastric cancers and the nearby normal gastric wall.The diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for detection of gastric cancer were significantly higher on combined conventional and DW MRI set (77.8-78.3%; 75.3-75.9%) than the CT imaging set (67.7-71.4%; 64.1-68.2%) or the conventional MRI set (72-73%; 68.8-70%; p < 0.01). In particular, for gastric cancers with pT2 and pT3, the combined conventional and DW MRI set (91.6-92.6%) yielded significantly higher sensitivity for detection of gastric cancer than did the CT imaging set (76.8-81.1%) by both observers (p < 0.01). The mean ADC of gastric cancer lesions (1 ± 0.23 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) differed significantly from that of normal gastric wall (1.77 ± 0.25 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p < 0.01).Abdominal MRI with DW imaging was more sensitive for the detection of gastric cancer than 2D-multidetector row CT or conventional MRI alone.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837701","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.788785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.663108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.514877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.424485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.241807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.196227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.123321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.116055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (temperature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(temperature)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Two-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
