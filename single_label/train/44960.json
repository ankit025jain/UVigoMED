{"id":44960,"title":"The impact of a pelvic pillow on learning how to perform laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer.","abstract":"This study evaluated the impact of the pelvic pillow on a single surgeon's learning how to perform laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer.We compared the outcomes for 23 patients with rectal cancer including the first 11 patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR without the pelvic pillow, and the latter 12 patients with the pelvic pillow by a single surgeon.The stage of the pelvic pillow (+) was more advanced than that of the pelvic pillow (-). The length of the operation and postoperative start of oral intake for the pelvic pillow (+) were shorter and earlier than those of the pelvic pillow (-). The pelvic surgical field in the pelvic pillow (+) was better and allowed better evaluation than the pelvic pillow (-).Maintaining an excellent view of the pelvic surgical field with the pelvic pillow might have an impact on learning laparoscopic LAR.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710225","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.644674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.484677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.477931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.370534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.334485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0471077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Laredo Heat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo_Heat"},{"name":"Maintaining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintaining"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Pillow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow"}]}
