{"id":15030,"title":"Emerging therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Despite decades of intense research, therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still limited to symptomatic treatments that possess only short-term efficacy. Recently, several large-scale Phase III trials targeting amyloid-? production or clearance have failed to show efficacy, leading to a reexamination of the amyloid hypothesis as well as highlighting the need to explore alternatives in both clinical testing strategies and drug discovery targets. In this review, we discuss therapeutics currently being tested in clinical trials and up-and-coming interventions that have shown promise in animal models, devoting attention to the mechanisms that may underlie their ability to influence disease progression and placing particular emphasis on tau therapeutics.","date":"2014-01-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392696","annotations":[{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.763568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.716761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.382264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.317452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Tau protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"},{"name":"Crisis pregnancy center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_pregnancy_center"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
