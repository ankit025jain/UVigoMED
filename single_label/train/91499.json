{"id":91499,"title":"The potential role of heat shock proteins in acute spinal cord injury.","abstract":"This study aims to investigate the differential expression proteins profile of spinal cord tissues after acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), provide preliminary results for further study and explore the secondary injury mechanisms underlying ASCI.Using Allen's frame to establish ASCI model of Sprague-Dawley rats, then a stable isotope-labelled strategy using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with two-dimensional (2D) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) was performed to separate and identify differentially expressed proteins.A total of 220 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the spinal cord tissues of H-8 group (acute spinal cord injury after 8 h) compared with H-0 group (acute spinal cord injury after 0 h); Up to 116 proteins were up-regulated, whereas 104 proteins were down-regulated in the spinal cord tissues. Three of the differentially expressed Heat shock proteins (HSPs) namely, Hsp90ab1, Hspa4 and Hspe1 were down-regulated.The differentially expressed proteins of spinal cord tissues after ASCI will provide scientific foundation for further study to explore the secondary injury mechanism of ASCI.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Wounds and
