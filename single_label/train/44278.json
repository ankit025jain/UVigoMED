{"id":44278,"title":"[A case of complete response(CR)to S-1 and paclitaxel(PTX)combination therapy in a patient with unresectable gastric cancer].","abstract":"We report a case of a patient with unresectable gastric cancer who showed complete response(CR)to S-1 and paclitaxel (PTX)combination therapy. The patient(a 67-year-old woman)was diagnosed with unresectable advanced gastric cancer with metastases in the Virchow's lymph nodes and para-aortic lymph nodes. Systemic chemotherapy with 70mg/m2 S-1 (days 1-14)and 70mg/m2 PTX(day 1)was administered every 3 weeks. At the end of 7 courses of chemotherapy, the primary lesion and swollen lymph nodes became markedly smaller. After 7 courses, an additional 39 courses were administered over 2.5 years. No notable adverse events were seen, and the patient's performance status(PS)was 0. CR was monitored by imaging studies. No cancer cells were detected on cytological examination of the primary lesion. Monotherapy with 70mg/m2 S-1(days 1-28, 2-week drug holiday)has been administered for the past 3 years. The patient is currently treated as an outpatient and maintains CR and a PS of 0.
