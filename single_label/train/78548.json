{"id":78548,"title":"Impact of 2011 French guidelines on antibiotic prescription for acute otitis media in infants.","abstract":"In 2011, new guidelines on antibiotic prescription for acute otitis media (AOM) were published in France to decrease the use of third generation cephalosporins that promote the carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli. Our objective was to assess the impact of the 2011 French recommendations on the type of antibiotics prescribed for AOM.Fourteen thousand six hundred and sixty-one children, 6 to 24 months of age, presenting with AOM were included in 2 studies, between November 1, 2009 and October 31, 2012. The first one was conducted with the support of 62 private practice pediatricians; the second one was conducted in 7 pediatric emergency departments. Three periods of 1 year each were defined.Antibiotics were prescribed in 12,471 (85.1%) of cases of AOM during the study period. Amoxicillin prescriptions was multiplied by 25, between the first year (2.6%) and the last year (66.1%). Conversely, prescriptions of cefpodoxime proxetil and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid decreased from 33.6% and 62.0% in the first year to 5.2% and 27.7% in the last year, respectively. This trend was observed in both private practices and in the pediatric emergency departments.Amoxicillin became the most frequently prescribed antibiotic for AOM in 2012, complying with the 2011 French guidelines, while the proportion of prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics decreased. Our study highlights the importance of guidelines to decrease the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics, a crucial factor in the prevention of antibiotic resistance.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630597","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"France","weight":0.613496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.504448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.463623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.302379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.250327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cefpodoxime","weight":0.198079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefpodoxime"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.178952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.131237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Multiplication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication"},{"name":"November 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_1"},{"name":"October 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_31"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Practice of law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Medical practice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_practice"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
