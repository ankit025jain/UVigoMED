{"id":45665,"title":"The role of 18F-FDG-PET and PET/CT in patients with colorectal liver metastases undergoing selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium-90: a first evidence-based review.","abstract":"To provide a first evidence-based review of the literature on the role of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET and PET/CT) in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) undergoing selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 ((90)Y) microspheres.A comprehensive computer literature search was conducted to find relevant published articles on whole-body FDG-PET or PET/CT in patients with CRLM undergoing SIRT.We identified 19 studies including 833 patients with CRLM undergoing SIRT. The role of FDG-PET or PET/CT was analysed in treatment planning, treatment response evaluation, and as prognostic tool.FDG-PET and PET/CT provide additional information in treatment evaluation of CRLM patients treated with SIRT and may have a role in treatment planning and patient selection. FDG-PET/CT is emerging as good prognostic tool in these patients.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672385","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.692417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.650996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.495399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.253962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.242819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.240597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.234341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Yttrium","weight":0.233015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
