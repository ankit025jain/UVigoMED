{"id":83565,"title":"Construction of dose response calibration curves for dicentrics and micronuclei for X radiation in a Serbian population.","abstract":"Biological dosimetry using chromosome damage biomarkers is a valuable dose assessment method in cases of radiation overexposure with or without physical dosimetry data. In order to estimate dose by biodosimetry, any biological dosimetry service have to have its own dose response calibration curve. This paper reveals the results obtained after irradiation of blood samples from fourteen healthy male and female volunteers in order to establish biodosimetry in Serbia and produce dose response calibration curves for dicentrics and micronuclei. Taking into account pooled data from all the donors, the resultant fitted curve for dicentrics is: Ydic=0.0009 (±0.0003)+0.0421 (±0.0042)×D+0.0602 (±0.0022)×D(2); and for micronuclei: Ymn=0.0104 (±0.0015)+0.0824 (±0.0050)×D+0.0189 (±0.0017)×D(2). Following establishment of the dose response curve, a validation experiment was carried out with four blood samples. Applied and estimated doses were in good agreement. On this basis, the results reported here give us confidence to apply both calibration curves for future biological dosimetry requirements in Serbia.
