{"id":62854,"title":"Spinning disk confocal imaging of neutrophil migration in zebrafish.","abstract":"Live-cell imaging techniques have been substantially improved due to advances in confocal microscopy instrumentation coupled with ultrasensitive detectors. The spinning disk confocal system is capable of generating images of fluorescent live samples with broad dynamic range and high temporal and spatial resolution. The ability to acquire fluorescent images of living cells in vivo on a millisecond timescale allows the dissection of biological processes that have not previously been visualized in a physiologically relevant context. In vivo imaging of rapidly moving cells such as neutrophils can be technically challenging. In this chapter, we describe the practical aspects of imaging neutrophils in zebrafish embryos using spinning disk confocal microscopy. Similar setups can also be applied to image other motile cell types and signaling processes in translucent animals or tissues.
