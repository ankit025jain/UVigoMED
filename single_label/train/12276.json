{"id":12276,"title":"Limb amputation and prosthesis.","abstract":"Limb amputation is an alternative to euthanasia when catastrophic injury prevents successful restoration of the limb or when cost is an issue. Proximal limb disarticulation for amputation is preferred if a prosthesis is not considered. Distal amputations are needed to accommodate exoskeletal prosthesis. This article reviews the considerations and describes techniques for this surgery.
