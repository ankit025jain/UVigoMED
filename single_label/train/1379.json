{"id":1379,"title":"[Effects of the 520-day isolation on the functional state of the cardiovascular system].","abstract":"Purpose of the work was to study the cardiovascular effects of simulated factors in a 520-day crewed mission to Mars, and to validate the diagnostic value of the ultrasonic investigation of microcirculation and endothelium-dependent dilation of the right brachial artery in 6 male volunteers at the age of 28 to 39 years. It appears that 520-d isolation affected intracardiac hemodynamics and endothelium function more dramatically compared with 105-d isolation, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis. These findings add insight into the \"cost of human adaptation\" to very long isolation.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365873","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.80437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.358668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.208333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.200466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Mars","weight":0.0741774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Manned mission to Mars","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Sakoku","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku"},{"name":"Mission to Mars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_to_Mars"},{"name":"Intracardiac injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracardiac_injection"},{"name":"Human flu","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flu"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Purpose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose"},{"name":"BMW 5 Series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
