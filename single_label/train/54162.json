{"id":54162,"title":"The inhibition of miR-21 promotes apoptosis and chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.","abstract":"MicroRNAs have been implicated in tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and prognosis in cancer. We investigated the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in regulating ovarian cancer drug resistance.We used parental and cisplatin resistant ovarian cell lines to demonstrate the role of miR-21 in drug resistance and investigated the gene targets of miR-21. Fresh tumor specimens were used to validate our in vitro findings.Cisplatin resistant ovarian cells were four-fold more resistant compared to the parental cell line. MiR-21 was overexpressed in the resistant cell line on microRNA microarray, which was subsequently validated with qRT-PCR. Using anti-microRNA inhibitors, we demonstrated that miR-21 attenuation reversed the drug resistant phenotype in both the resistant and parental cell lines. The inhibition of miR-21 induced apoptosis based on annexin V-FITC immunostaining. Using Western blot analysis, miR-21 knockdown enhanced the expression of tumor suppressor PDCD4, and attenuated apoptosis inhibitor c-IAP2. Using 101 specimens from advanced ovarian cancer patients enrolled in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that women with tumors that overexpressed miR-21 were associated with a shorter progression-free survival.Our data suggest that miR-21 regulates drug resistance via apoptosis and cellular survival pathways. Targeting miR-21 may have clinical utility in the treatment of resistant ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472409","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.71171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.707053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"The Cancer Genome Atlas","weight":0.582917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.345557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.293542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0331675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculoviral_IAP_repeat-containing_protein_3"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
