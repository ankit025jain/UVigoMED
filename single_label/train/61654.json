{"id":61654,"title":"NOTCH1 mutations are associated with favourable long-term prognosis in paediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a retrospective study of patients treated on BCH-2003 and CCLG-2008 protocol in China.","abstract":"Activating mutations of NOTCH1 are a common occurrence in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), but its impact on T-ALL treatment is still controversial. In this study, the incidence, clinical features, and prognosis of 92 Chinese children with T-ALL treated using the Beijing Children's Hospital-2003 and Chinese Childhood Leukaemia Group-2008 protocols were analysed. NOTCH1 mutations were found in 42% of T-ALL patients and were not associated with clinical features, prednisone response, and minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 33 and 78. However, proline, glutamate, serine, threonine (PEST)/transactivation domain (TAD) mutations were associated with younger age (15/16 mutant vs. 48/76 wild-type, P = 0·018) and more central nervous system involvement (4/16 mutant vs. 3/76 wild-type, P = 0·016); while heterodimerization domain (HD) mutations were associated with KMT2A-MLLT1 (MLL-ENL; 4/30 mutant vs. 1/62 wild-type, P = 0·037). Furthermore, prognosis was better in patients with NOTCH1 mutations than in those with wild-type NOTCH1 (5-year event-free survival [EFS] 92·0 ± 4·5% vs. 64·0 ± 7·1%; P = 0·003). Long-term outcome was better in patients carrying HD mutations than in patients with wild-type HD (5-year EFS 89·7 ± 5·6% vs. 69·3 ± 6·2%; P = 0·034). NOTCH1 mutations and MRD at day 78 were independent prognostic factors. These findings indicate that NOTCH1 mutation predicts a favourable outcome in Chinese paediatric patients with T-ALL on the BCH-2003 and CCLG-2008 protocols, and may be considered a prognostic stratification factor.
