{"id":66026,"title":"Contemporary cost-effectiveness analysis comparing sequential bacillus Calmette-Guerin and electromotive mitomycin versus bacillus Calmette-Guerin alone for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","abstract":"Sequential bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and electromotive mitomycin (sequential therapy) have been shown in a randomized prospective trial to be superior to therapy with BCG alone in patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The objective of the current study was to compare the costs and benefits of these 2 treatment strategies by performing a 5-year and 10-year cost-effectiveness study.A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over a 5-year and 10-year period. Estimates of disease progression, death, and treatment efficacy were obtained from what to the authors' knowledge is the only randomized trial comparing the 2 therapies. Costs included: 1) medical costs (physician fees); 2) drug costs (preparation and instillation); and 3) hospital costs (procedure fees, admission fees, and tests and procedures done during surveillance). Patients were allowed a second course of induction therapy.Sequential therapy was found to be associated with a higher initial material cost for induction and maintenance. The average effectiveness for the patients treated with therapy with BCG alone was 4.39 years with a mean cost of $9236 (95% confidence interval, $9118-$9345) per patient. The sequential group resulted in an average effectiveness of 4.65 years, with a mean cost of $16,468 (95% confidence interval, $16,371-$16,527). The 5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of sequential versus BCG-alone therapy was $27,815 per life-year gained. The corresponding figure over a 10-year period was $8618 per life-year gained.The results of the current study suggest that sequential therapy is a cost-effective treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752448","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.692027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.497917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"815","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/815"},{"name":"527","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/527"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Markov process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Boston Consulting Group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Consulting_Group"},{"name":"Markov chain","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Health care prices","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
