{"id":34469,"title":"Risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia.","abstract":"Intraventricular hemorrhage is rare in term newborns. Severe asphyxia is recognized as one of the risk factors of intraventricular hemorrhage in these newborns. Therapeutic hypothermia, which is the only available treatment for the limitation of brain injury in term asphyxiated newborns, may cause fluctuations of cerebral blood flow, possibly placing the newborn more at risk for intraventricular hemorrhage. The literature regarding the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage in the context of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and hypothermia is sparse.We present a clinical observation and review the literature regarding the risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia.We describe the clinical course of a term newborn with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy who developed significant intraventricular hemorrhage during the rewarming period after the 72-hour hypothermia.This newborn presented several risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage, including severe asphyxia, hemodynamic instability, hemostasis disturbances, instrument delivery, venous sinus thrombosis, and hypoglycemia. Hypothermia and rewarming also may have contributed by causing fluctuations in cerebral blood flow.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731482","annotations":[{"name":"Therapeutic hypothermia","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_hypothermia"},{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.922386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.828271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Cerebral blood flow","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_blood_flow"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.659496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis","weight":0.474015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_venous_sinus_thrombosis"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.457305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.423873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.361859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.262604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.250845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
