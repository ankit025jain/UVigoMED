{"id":32697,"title":"[A study of the usefulness of flow-adjustable bilateral pulmonary artery banding (FABPAB) for hypoplastic left heart syndrome( HLHS) or HLHS variant].","abstract":"Bilateral pulmonary artery banding( BPAB), a relatively minimally invasive procedure, has begun to be undertaken as the initial operation for the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or HLHS variant. In the opinion of the present authors, it is practicable to avoid stepwise operations with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in newborn patients by conducting an initial operation consisting of flow-adjustable bilateral pulmonary artery banding (FABPAB) combined with transcatheter pulmonary artery balloon dilatation( PABD), followed in a subsequent treatment course by transcatheter PABD, which would allow for more minimally invasive adjustment of the pulmonary artery bloodflow. This study was conducted as a retrospective evaluation of the usefulness of this therapeutic strategy.Fourteen patients who underwent BPAB as the initial operation for HLHS/HLHS variant between April 2008 and October 2013 were included in this study. Stepwise surgical repair including BPAB was performed via a median sternotomy as the initial operation, without the use of CPB. And 7 patients underwent transcatheter PABD successfully.In this series, 7 patients developed a significant pulmonary artery index (PAI) after PABD (pre PABD:148.3±63.9 vs. post PABD:232.5±73.2, p<0.05). No need of the pulmonary artery reconstruction at the 2nd operation. One patient failed to survive the operation, in which difficulty in adjustment of atrioventricular valvular regurgitation was encountered after the Norwood procedure. There were 3 patients who underwent the Norwood combined BDG at the mean age of 4.6 months and the mean body weight of 5.5 kg. Fontan procedure was accomplished in 3 of the 6 patients of the survivor, while 3 patients were on standby for the Fontan procedure.We performed BPAB as the initial operation combined with PABD in the treatment of HLHS/HLHS variant, which enabled avoidance of the initial operation with cardiopulmonary bypass at the neonatal stage and developed a significant pulmonary artery index after PABD.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
