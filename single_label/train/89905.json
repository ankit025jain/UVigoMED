{"id":89905,"title":"Heat stress does not exacerbate tennis-induced alterations in physical performance.","abstract":"To assess the time course of changes in physical performance in response to match-play tennis under heat stress.Two matches consisting of 20 min of effective playing time (2×10 min segments) were played in COOL (?102 min; ?22°C and 70% relative humidity (RH)) and HOT (?119 min; ?36°C and 35% RH) environments. Repeated-sprint ability (3×15 m, 15 s rest), 15 m sprint time with a direction change (180°), vertical jump height (squat and countermovement jumps) and leg stiffness (multirebound jumps) were assessed in 12 competitive male players prematch, midmatch and postmatch, and 24 and 48 h after match completion.During the repeated-sprint ability test, initial (+2.3% and +3.1%) and cumulated sprint (+1.5% and +2.8%) times increased from prematch to midmatch and postmatch, respectively (p<0.001), while the sprint decrement score did not change. Match-play tennis induced a slowing (average of both conditions: +1.1% and +1.3% at midmatch and postmatch time points; p=0.05) of 15 m sprint time with direction change. Compared with prematch, leg stiffness (-6.4% and -6.5%; p<0.001) and squat jump height (-1.5% and -2.4%; p=0.05), but not countermovement jump height (-0.7% and -1.3%; p>0.05), decreased midmatch and postmatch, respectively, regardless of the condition. Complete recovery in all physical performance markers occurred within 24 h.In tennis, match-related fatigue is characterised by impaired repeated-sprint ability, explosive power and leg stiffness at midmatch and postmatch, with values restored to prematch baseline 24 h into recovery. In addition, physical performance responses (match and recovery kinetics) are identical when competing in cool and hot environments.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668378","annotations":[{"name":"Relative humidity","weight":0.546556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity"},{"name":"Tennis","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.302835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.286983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.252154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Vertical jump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_jump"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Tennis court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sprint (running)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)"},{"name":"Match play","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Stream capture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_capture"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_yield"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"COOL Award Winners","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COOL_Award_Winners"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Increment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Squatting","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting"},{"name":"Chemical kinetics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Countermovement","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countermovement"}]}
