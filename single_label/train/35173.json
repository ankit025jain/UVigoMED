{"id":35173,"title":"Identification of novel HSP90?/? isoform selective inhibitors using structure-based drug design. demonstration of potential utility in treating CNS disorders such as Huntington's disease.","abstract":"A structure-based drug design strategy was used to optimize a novel benzolactam series of HSP90?/? inhibitors to achieve >1000-fold selectivity versus the HSP90 endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial isoforms (GRP94 and TRAP1, respectively). Selective HSP90?/? inhibitors were found to be equipotent to pan-HSP90 inhibitors in promoting the clearance of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) in vitro, however with less cellular toxicity. Improved tolerability profiles may enable the use of HSP90?/? selective inhibitors in treating chronic neurodegenerative indications such as Huntington's disease (HD). A potent, selective, orally available HSP90?/? inhibitor was identified (compound 31) that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Compound 31 demonstrated proof of concept by successfully reducing brain Htt levels following oral dosing in rats.
