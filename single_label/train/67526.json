{"id":67526,"title":"Reprogramming can be a transforming experience.","abstract":"Since the inception of nuclear reprogramming, the parallels between this process and tumorigenesis have become increasingly apparent. Recent studies by Abad et al. and Ohnishi et al. have now formalized this connection by demonstrating that the same transcription factors used for reprogramming to pluripotency drive tumor initiation in vivo.
