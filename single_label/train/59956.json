{"id":59956,"title":"[Telomere length of peripheral lymphocytes in patients with immuno-related pancytopenia].","abstract":"To investigate the changes of relative telomere length (RTL) of peripheral blood (PB) CD3?, CD3?CD4?, CD3?CD8?T lymphocytes, CD19?B lymphocytes and bone marrow (BM) CD34? cells and its association with disease severity in untreated patients with immuno-related pancytopenia (IRP).The PB CD3? , CD3? CD4? , CD3? CD8? T lymphocytes, CD19? B lymphocytes, and BM CD34? cells were purified by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), and RTL were measured with flow-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FLOW-FISH).The RTL of CD3?, CD3?CD4? , and CD3?CD8?T lymphocytes in untreated IRP patients were (27.754 ± 16.323)%, (7.526 ± 3.745)% and (25.854 ± 14.789)%, respectivly, which were significantly shorter than those in healthy-controls (54.555 ± 19.782)%, (12.096 ± 2.805)%, and (38.367 ± 4.626)% (P<0.05). The RTL of CD19? lymphocytes in untreated IRP patients was (22.136 ± 16.142)%, which was significantly shorter than that in healthy controls (42.846 ± 16.353)% (P<0.01). There was no significant difference of BM CD34? cells RTL between the untreated IRP patients (22.528 ± 21.601)% and the healthy controls (23.936 ± 19.822)% (P>0.05). There were significantly positive correlations between the RTL of B lymphocytes and the count of white blood cell (r=0.706, P=0.015). There were negative correlations between RTL of B lymphocytes and the clinical symptoms (r=-0.613, P=0.045) and positive correlations with therapeutic effect (r=0.775, P=0.005).The shorter RTL of CD3?, CD3?CD4?, CD3?CD8?, CD19? lymphocytes, and the normal RTL of BM CD34? cells in untreated IRP patients were identified, which might imply that IRP is a type of acquired autoimmune diseases.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
