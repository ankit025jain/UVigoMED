{"id":67840,"title":"Population-based comparative effectiveness of salvage radical prostatectomy vs cryotherapy.","abstract":"To characterize population-based practice patterns, disease-specific and overall mortality, and cost associated with salvage cryotherapy (SCT) vs salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP).We retrospectively identified 440 men who failed primary radiation therapy and subsequently underwent SCT (n = 341, 77.5%) or SRP (n = 99, 22.5%) between 1992 and 2009 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data. Propensity score analyses were used to compare overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality and associated Medicare expenditures for SRP vs SCT.Men undergoing SCT were more likely to be white (P <.001), less likely to be high school graduates (P = .008), and experienced shorter median time from diagnosis to salvage therapy (44.1 vs 60.1, P <.001) and from primary radiotherapy to salvage therapy (38.7 vs 55.8 months, P <.001). In adjusted analyses, overall mortality was higher (21.6 vs 6.1 deaths/100 person years, P <.001) for SRP vs SCT. There was a trend for higher prostate cancer-specific death rates with SRP vs SCT (6.5 vs 1.4 deaths/100 person years, P = .061). Medicare expenditures for SRP vs SCT were more than 2-fold higher ($19,543 vs $8,088, P <.001).SRP vs SCT is associated with higher overall mortality and greater health care expenditures. However, longer follow-up is needed to assess long-term functional outcomes and cancer control.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581527","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.607424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.600478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.426399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.416564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Salvage therapy","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage_therapy"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"1992","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992"},{"name":"543","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/543"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"44,100 Hz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz"},{"name":"Linked Data","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data"},{"name":"Graduation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Propensity probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_probability"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
