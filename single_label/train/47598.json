{"id":47598,"title":"Hepatic steatosis is associated with increased hepatic FDG uptake.","abstract":"The use of liver as a reference tissue for semi-quantification of tumour FDG uptake may not be valid in hepatic steatosis (HS). Previous studies on the relation between liver FDG uptake and HS have been contradictory probably because they ignored blood glucose (BG). Because hepatocyte and blood FDG concentrations equalize, liver FDG uptake parallels BG, which must therefore be considered when studying hepatic FDG uptake. We therefore re-examined the relation between HS and liver uptake taking BG into account.This was a retrospective study of 304 patients undergoing routine PET/CT with imaging 60min post-FDG. Average standard uptake value (SUVave), maximum SUV (SUVmax) and CT density (index of HS) were measured in a liver ROI. Blood pool SUV was based on the left ventricular cavity (SUVLV). Correlations were assessed using least squares fitting of continuous data. Patients were also divided into BG subgroups (<4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-8, 8-10 and 10+mmol/l).SUVave, SUVmax and SUVLV displayed similar relations with BG. SUVmax/SUVLV, but not SUVave/SUVLV, correlated significantly with BG. SUVmax, but not SUVave, correlated inversely with CT density before and after adjusting for BG. SUVmax/SUVave correlated more strongly with CT density than SUVmax. CT density correlated inversely with SUVmax/SUVLV but positively with SUVave/SUVLV.Hepatic SUV is more influenced by BG than by HS. Its relation with BG renders it unsuitable as a reference tissue. Nevertheless, hepatic fat does correlate positively with liver SUV, although this is seen only with SUVmax because SUVave is 'diluted' by hepatic fat.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581596","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.810842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.782628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.339783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.188471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0983038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Sport utility vehicle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle"},{"name":"Least squares","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Continuous probability distribution","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_probability_distribution"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Contradiction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Rate of return","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return"}]}
