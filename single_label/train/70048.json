{"id":70048,"title":"Nonlinear image blending for dual-energy MDCT of the abdomen: can image quality be preserved if the contrast medium dose is reduced?","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare the image quality of a dual-energy nonlinear image blending technique at reduced load of contrast medium with a simulated 120-kVp linear blending technique at a full dose during portal venous phase MDCT of the abdomen.Forty-five patients (25 men, 20 women; mean age, 65.6 ± 9.7 [SD] years; mean body weight, 74.9 ± 12.4 kg) underwent contrast-enhanced single-phase dual-energy CT of the abdomen by a random assignment to one of three different contrast medium (iomeprol 400) dose injection protocols: 1.3, 1.0, or 0.65 mL/kg of body weight. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and noise at the portal vein, liver, aorta, and kidney were compared among the different datasets using the ANOVA. Three readers qualitatively assessed all datasets in a blinded and independent fashion.Nonlinear blended images at a 25% reduced dose allowed a significant improvement in CNR (p < 0.05 for all comparisons), compared with simulated 120-kVp linear blended images at a full dose. No statistically significant difference existed in CNR and noise between the nonlinear blended images at a 50% reduced dose and the simulated 120-kVp linear blended images at a full dose. Nonlinear blended images at a 50% reduced dose were considered in all cases to have acceptable image quality.The dual-energy nonlinear image blending technique allows reducing the dose of contrast medium up to 50% during portal venous phase imaging of the abdomen while preserving image quality.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247950","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.509685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.473271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.241547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.204998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0632479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Canadian National Railway","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
