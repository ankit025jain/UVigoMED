{"id":63193,"title":"A multicentre study of primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the rituximab era.","abstract":"Primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with limited data on pathology and outcome. A multicentre retrospective study was undertaken to determine prognostic factors and the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses. Data was retrospectively collected on patients from 8 US academic centres. Only patients with stage I/II disease (involvement of breast and localized lymph nodes) were included. Histologies apart from primary DLBCL were excluded. Between 1992 and 2012, 76 patients met the eligibility criteria. Most patients (86%) received chemotherapy, and 69% received immunochemotherapy with rituximab; 65% received radiation therapy and 9% received prophylactic CNS chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 4·5 years (range 0·6-20·6 years), the Kaplan-Meier estimated median progression-free survival was 10·4 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 5·8-14·9 years), and the median overall survival was 14·6 years (95% CI 10·2-19 years). Twelve patients (16%) had CNS relapse. A low stage-modified International Prognostic Index (IPI) was associated with longer overall survival. Rituximab use was not associated with a survival advantage. Primary breast DLBCL has a high rate of CNS relapse. The stage-modified IPI score is associated with survival.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467658","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.597221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.5245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.470523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.469103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.419125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.32073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Survival of the fittest","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0225798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"}]}
