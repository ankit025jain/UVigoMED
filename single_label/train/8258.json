{"id":8258,"title":"ACE overexpression in myelomonocytic cells: effect on a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"While it is well known that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in blood pressure control, ACE also has effects on renal function, hematopoiesis, reproduction, and aspects of the immune response. ACE 10/10 mice overexpress ACE in myelomonocytic cells. Macrophages from these mice have an increased polarization towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype that results in a very effective immune response to challenge by tumors or bacterial infection. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the ACE 10/10 phenotype provides significant protection against AD pathology, including reduced inflammation, reduced burden of the neurotoxic amyloid-? protein and preserved cognitive function. Taken together, these studies show that increased myelomonocytic ACE expression in mice alters the immune response to better defend against many different types of pathologic insult, including the cognitive decline observed in an animal model of AD.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792094","annotations":[{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.784028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme","weight":0.704207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.678945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.647956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.631552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.603496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.305461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.299158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.10298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Overexpress","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexpress"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
