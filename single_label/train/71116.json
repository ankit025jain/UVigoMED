{"id":71116,"title":"The application of cryoprobe therapy in orthopedic oncology.","abstract":"The cryoprobe is a relatively new surgical tool offering a more selective destruction of unwanted cells. Using expanded versions of basic thermodynamic formulas of conduction and convection, mathematical models are becoming more effective at mapping out the zone of destruction that can be expected when using cryoprobes. The development of this technology will allow for better surgical planning and postoperative care to decrease patient morbidity and mortality. It is thought that this invaluable tool will become increasingly prevalent in orthopedics.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102496","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.565145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.557171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Thermodynamics","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Convection","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.168905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.129087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Orthopedics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedics"},{"name":"Surgical planning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_planning"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Formula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Conduction (heat)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_(heat)"},{"name":"Cryosurgery","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosurgery"}]}
