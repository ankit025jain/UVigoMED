{"id":53434,"title":"Decreased fetal pre-adipocyte factor-1 in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Serum pre-adipocyte factor-1 (pref-1) is an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation that increases in small for gestational age fetuses. It plays a role in adipose metabolism and is associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases in adulthood. We hypothesized that preadipocyte factor-1 (pref-1) concentration is altered in fetuses born to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Umbilical cord blood pref-1 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay in 37 fetuses from pregnancies complicated by GDM and 45 fetuses from normal pregnancies.Serum pref-1 concentrations were significantly lower in fetuses of women with GDM compared to normal pregnancies (16.12±6.48 vs. 22.09±7.22 ?g/l, P=0.001). Birth weight was significantly higher in GDM fetuses compared to normal pregnancies (3567±544 vs. 3253±370 g, P=0.003).Pregnancies complicated by GDM have decreased fetal pref-1 concentrations compared to normal pregnancies. These differences may be significant in terms of their later development of metabolic conditions.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518358","annotations":[{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.772227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.74127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.640401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.490986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.47108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Small for gestational age","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_for_gestational_age"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.145792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
