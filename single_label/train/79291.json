{"id":79291,"title":"Restoring ciliary function to differentiated primary ciliary dyskinesia cells with a lentiviral vector.","abstract":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogenous autosomal recessive disease in which mutations disrupt ciliary function, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and life-long lung disease. Mouse tracheal cells with a targeted deletion in the axonemal dynein intermediate chain 1 (Dnaic1) gene differentiate normally in culture but lack ciliary activity. Gene transfer to undifferentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with avian influenza hemagglutinin restored Dnaic1 expression and ciliary activity. Importantly, apical treatment of well-differentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with lentiviral vector also restored ciliary activity, demonstrating successful gene transfer from the apical surface. Treatment of Dnaic1(flox/flox) mice expressing an estrogen-responsive Cre recombinase with different doses of tamoxifen indicated that restoration of ?20% of ciliary activity may be sufficient to prevent the development of rhinosinusitis. However, although administration of a ?-galactosidase-expressing vector into control mice demonstrated efficient gene transfer to the nasal epithelium, treatment of Dnaic1(-/-) mice resulted in a low level of gene transfer, demonstrating that the severe rhinitis present in these animals impedes gene transfer. The results demonstrate that gene replacement therapy may be a viable treatment option for PCD, but further improvements in the efficiency of gene transfer are necessary.
