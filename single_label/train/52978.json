{"id":52978,"title":"Human ?-cell proliferation and intracellular signaling part 2: still driving in the dark without a road map.","abstract":"Enhancing ?-cell proliferation is a major goal for type 1 and type 2 diabetes research. Unraveling the network of ?-cell intracellular signaling pathways that promote ?-cell replication can provide the tools to address this important task. In a previous Perspectives in Diabetes article, we discussed what was known regarding several important intracellular signaling pathways in rodent ?-cells, including the insulin receptor substrate/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (IRS-PI3K-Akt) pathways, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) S6 kinase pathways, protein kinase C? (PKC?) pathways, and their downstream cell-cycle molecular targets, and contrasted that ample knowledge to the small amount of complementary data on human ?-cell intracellular signaling pathways. In this Perspectives, we summarize additional important information on signaling pathways activated by nutrients, such as glucose; growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and Wnt; and hormones, such as leptin, estrogen, and progesterone, that are linked to rodent and human ?-cell proliferation. With these two Perspectives, we attempt to construct a brief summary of knowledge for ?-cell researchers on mitogenic signaling pathways and to emphasize how little is known regarding intracellular events linked to human ?-cell replication. This is a critical aspect in the long-term goal of expanding human ?-cells for the prevention and/or cure of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
