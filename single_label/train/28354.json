{"id":28354,"title":"Protective factors against relapse for practicing nurse anesthetists in recovery from anesthetic opiate dependency.","abstract":"This qualitative inquiry explored factors that protect recovering anesthetic opioid-dependent nurse anesthetists from relapse after their return to anesthesia practice. Practicing nurse anesthetists in recovery from potent opioids were recruited through online advertising and individually interviewed over the telephone. The interview consisted of open-ended questions that aided description of personal experience of individual factors. Content analysis of the interviews revealed an overarching theme of a commitment to the recovery process, which provided the foundational protective element against relapse. Within this context, two major thematic factors emerged: personal factors and external factors. Personal factors came from within the individual and included such features as removing the obsession to use, self-realization, inner strength, and seeing the future. External factors were external to the individual and described as time away from practice, state regulatory agency involvement, and talking with significant others. Although the Twelve-Step process was not a factor per se, it was credited by all participants as the structure on which their recovery was built. This process provided mechanisms for developing the motivation and learning the tools necessary to maintain their sobriety.
