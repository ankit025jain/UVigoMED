{"id":61259,"title":"[Sudden blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia after a 13-year durable remission following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusion].","abstract":"We describe a rare case of sudden blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia that occurred after a 13-year durable remission, following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusion. A 55-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia 24 years previously. He underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 2 years after diagnosis. Although the disease recurred 6 years after transplantation, the patient achieved remission again by a donor lymphocyte infusion. Despite a 13-year durable remission, the disease later relapsed into a sudden blast crisis. Prednisolone and vincristine combined with imatinib mesylate effectively achieved a major molecular response. However, the disease relapsed repeatedly with central nervous system infiltration. Dasatinib and intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone administration via the Ommaya reservoir controlled disease progression. Nevertheless, the disease became refractory to treatment with the emergence of a T315I Bcr-Abl gene mutation. The patient eventually died 43 months post crisis.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743212","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Ommaya reservoir","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ommaya_reservoir"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Intrathecal","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrathecal"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.889723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.888519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogeneic_bone_marrow_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.71779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.505722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.481255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}]}
