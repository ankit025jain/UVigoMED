{"id":67853,"title":"[Effects of stanniocalcin-1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1? on mitochondrial membrane potential stability in renal carcinoma cells].","abstract":"To explore the effects of stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) on the calcium and thus on the mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) in renal carcinoma cells.We successfully established the renal carcinoma cell models with high HIF-1? gene expression. After various concentrations of STC-1 solutions were added to the culture medium, the proliferation of cells, expressions of HIF-1? and STC-1, levels of Ca(2+), ??m, and mPTP were detected by MTT, RT-PCR, ELISA, fluorescence spectrophotometry, and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively.The proliferation of renal carcinoma cells and ??m were improved after HIF-1? gene transfection, STC-1 protein intervention, and STC-1 protein intervention after gene transfection. While the intracellular Ca(2+) level and mPTP were decreased significantly (P<0.05), all the changes were intensified with the gradual increase of STC-1. However, the increasing trend of cell proliferation gradually declined.HIF-1? may participate in malignant proliferation of renal carcinoma cells by promoting STC-1 proliferation or down-regulating Ca(2+); however, such an effect may be gradually attenuated due to the inhibitory effect of STC-1 on HIF-1?.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581122","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.834958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.718403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.671161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.452934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.261989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"}]}
