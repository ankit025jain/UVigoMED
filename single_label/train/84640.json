{"id":84640,"title":"[Management of the elderly in the emergency department: a suitable solution or a second best choice?].","abstract":"The prolongation of life expectancy can only increase the proportion of elderly people in the future. The Emergency Departments being the main gateway to our hospitals, they will often have to admit such patients with their distinct characteristics. These individuals present with a more or less marked geriatric profile; it will be essential to determine their degree of frailty, a factor allowing to predict their survival and future level of autonomy. Evaluation tools have been developed to improve the management of these patients at important moments of their stay in the Emergency Department.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065249","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.410479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.253892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Moment (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Gateway (telecommunications)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)"},{"name":"Prolongation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolongation"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0150458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Nadi International Airport","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadi_International_Airport"}]}
