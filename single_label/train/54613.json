{"id":54613,"title":"Assessment of ocular biomechanics using dynamic ultra high-speed Scheimpflug imaging in keratoconic and normal eyes.","abstract":"To introduce several new ocular biomechanical parameters for comparison between keratoconic and normal eyes using an analysis method based on corneal dynamic deformation video recorded by corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology (Corvis ST; Oculus OptikgerÃ¤te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).This comparative study comprised 52 keratoconic eyes of 43 patients with keratoconus and 52 normal eyes of 52 controls. An analysis method (PolyU [Labview 2009; National Instrument, Austin, TX]) was developed to introduce several new ocular biomechanical parameters and to compare the difference between keratoconic and normal eyes. The repeatability of the new parameters measurement was evaluated and compared with the Corvis ST measurement. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to establish a cutoff value for the new biomechanical parameters.Intraclass correlation coefficients of the deformation amplitude, peak distance, corneal concave radius of curvature, maximum deformation area, maximum corneal inward velocity and outward velocity (Vin, max and Vout, max) were high in both the keratoconic and normal eyes (all intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.75). The measurement agreement of the PolyU analysis method and Corvis ST was good. Most of the biomechanical parameters of patients with keratoconus were significantly different from those of the controls. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the Vin, max was the best predictive parameter with an area under the curve of 0.79.The corneal deformation video recorded by the Corvis ST provides useful information for the study of ocular biomechanics. Most of the new ocular biomechanical parameters were significantly different between keratoconic and normal eyes. Further research is needed to develop more comprehensive clinical applications with these new ocular biomechanical parameters.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Eye
