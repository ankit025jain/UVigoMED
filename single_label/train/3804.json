{"id":3804,"title":"Effects of arsenic compounds on growth, cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis of tretinoin-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia cells.","abstract":"The effects of inorganic and organic arsenicals on proliferation, cell-cycle distribution, and apoptosis of all-transretinoic acid (ATRA)-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 (HL-60-R2) cells were herein investigated.Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell-cycle distribution and apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) for As2O3 against proliferation of HL-60 and HL-60-R2 cells were 12.2 and 7.2 ?M, while those for arsenate were >200 and 62.1 ?M, respectively. In contrast, organic methylarsinic acid, dimethylarsonic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, and tetramethylarsonium did not exert any inhibitory effects even at 200 ?M. As2O3 and arsenate increased the proportion of apoptotic cells dose-dependently at a concentration range of 5-200 ?M. As2O3 did not activate caspase 3/7 in HL-60 and HL-60-R2 cells.As2O3 and arsenate inhibit cell proliferation, affect cell-cycle distribution, and induce apoptosis of ATRA-resistant HL-60-R2 cells. The apoptosis-inducing mechanism appears not to be mediated through caspase3/7.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25368250","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.876129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.815076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Inorganic compound","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.76801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.646976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.610087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.570816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Arsenate","weight":0.464973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenate"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.181725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Trimethylarsine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethylarsine"},{"name":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
