{"id":17977,"title":"Drug-resistant tuberculosis in subjects included in the Second National Survey on Antituberculosis Drug Resistance in Porto Alegre, Brazil.","abstract":"To describe the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among tuberculosis patients in a major Brazilian city, evaluated via the Second National Survey on Antituberculosis Drug Resistance, as well as the social, demographic, and clinical characteristics of those patients.Clinical samples were collected from tuberculosis patients seen between 2006 to 2007 at three hospitals and five primary health care clinics participating in the survey in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The samples were subjected to drug susceptibility testing. The species of mycobacteria was confirmed using biochemical methods.Of the 299 patients included, 221 (73.9%) were men and 77 (27.3%) had a history of tuberculosis. The mean age was 36 years. Of the 252 patients who underwent HIV testing, 66 (26.2%) tested positive. The prevalence of MDR-TB in the sample as a whole was 4.7% (95% CI: 2.3-7.1), whereas it was 2.2% (95% CI: 0.3-4.2) among the new cases of tuberculosis and 12.0% (95% CI: 4.5-19.5) among the patients with a history of tuberculosis treatment. The multivariate analysis showed that a history of tuberculosis and a longer time to diagnosis were both associated with MDR-TB.If our results are corroborated by other studies conducted in Brazil, a history of tuberculosis treatment and a longer time to diagnosis could be used as predictors of MDR-TB.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831400","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.814271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.416282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.414075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.362518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.326483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Porto Alegre","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"French Resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Porto","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"}]}
