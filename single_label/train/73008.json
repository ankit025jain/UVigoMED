{"id":73008,"title":"Bibliometrics of intraoperative radiotherapy: analysis of technology, practice and publication tendencies.","abstract":"To analyze the performance and quality of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) publications identified in medical databases during a recent period in terms of bibliographic metrics.A bibliometric search was conducted for IORT papers published in the PubMed database between 1997 and 2013. Publication rate was used as a quantity indicator; the 2012 Science Citation Index Impact Factor as a quality indicator. Furthermore, the publications were stratified in terms of study type, scientific topic reported, year of publication, tumor type and journal specialty. We performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine differences between the means of the analyzed groups.Among the total of 207 journals, articles were reported significantly more frequently in surgery (n?=?399, 41?%) and radiotherapy journals (n?=?273, 28?%; p?<?0.01). The highest impact factor was achieved by clinical oncology journals (p?<?0.01). The majority of identified articles were retrospective cohort reports (n?=?622, 64?%), followed by review articles (n?=?204, 21?%; p?<?0.001). Regarding primary topic, reports on cancer outcome following specific tumor therapy were most frequently published (n?=?661, 68?%; p?<?0.001) and gained the highest mean impact factor (p?<?0.01). Gastrointestinal tumor reports were represented most frequently (n?=?456, 47?%; p?<?0.001) and the mean superior impact factor was earned by breast and gynecologic publications (p?<?0.01).We identified a consistent and sustained scientific productivity of international IORT expert groups. Most publications appeared in journals with surgical and radiooncological content. The highest impact factor was achieved by medical oncology journals.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928250","annotations":[{"name":"Science Citation Index","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Citation_Index"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Impact factor","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Bibliometrics","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.68083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.562923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.540434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.501414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.439644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Review journal","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_journal"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Citation index","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_index"},{"name":"Intraoperative radiation therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Citation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
