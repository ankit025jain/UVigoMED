{"id":45493,"title":"Total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery.","abstract":"Laparoscopic-assisted colonic resection has been well described for multiple surgical indications and typically requires an abdominal incision for specimen removal that is associated with most of the postoperative pain. We report the total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation for megacolon in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery for transanal specimen retrieval and anastomosis to avoid the additional abdominal extraction incision.Two cases are presented: case 1 was a 15-year-old boy who presented with intermittent abdominal distention, pain, and constipation for 3 years' duration and was diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease, and case 2 was a 60-year-old man who presented with repeated attacks of incomplete intestinal obstruction for 2 years' duration and was diagnosed with adult megacolon. They were treated by the total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation without an abdominal extraction incision in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. The operations were successfully accomplished without conversion to open surgery. The patients tolerated the procedure well, complained of minimal postoperative pain, and did not require narcotics beyond the day of the operation. No surgical complications occurred. Discharge from the hospital occurred on the ninth postoperative day in case 1 and the 13th postoperative day in case 2.The total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery is a feasible and minimally invasive technique for idiopathic megacolon and adult megacolon. This advanced surgical technique was developed by combining laparoscopy with the concept of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680156","annotations":[{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.694475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery","weight":0.581317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_orifice_translumenal_endoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Megacolon","weight":0.543057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacolon"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.384919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Hirschsprung's disease","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease"},{"name":"Narcotic","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
