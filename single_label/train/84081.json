{"id":84081,"title":"[Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 and human diseases].","abstract":"Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) is a member of a superfamily of histidine triad proteins named by the conserved nucleotide-binding motif histidine-x-histidine-x-histidine-xx, in which x represents hydrophobic amino acid. HINT1 is implicated in pathological progress of many human diseases including cancer and schizophrenia; however, little is known about the essential role and pathological consequences of HINT1 in cellular physiology and diseases. Therefore, we summarize the structure, distribution, and physiological function of HINT1 in cells and tissues as well as the correlation between HINT1 and human diseases.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176218","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.858127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Histidine","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.327397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Cell physiology","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_physiology"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
