{"id":69451,"title":"Decreased expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin in the bladder urothelium of patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome.","abstract":"Unique barrier properties of the urothelial surface membrane permit urine storage without contents leak into the bloodstream. Previous reports suggested that the bladder urothelial barrier might be compromised in interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). We examined the changes of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin) in IC/PBS patients.Bladder samples were derived from of 32 patients with IC/PBS and eight controls. We detected the tight junction proteins of ZO-1 and occludin expression by immunoblotting, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and double immunofluorescent (IF) staining with confocal microscopy. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.Expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the IC/PBS group was reduced compared to the control group by immunoblotting and IHC staining. Also, the thinning and denudation of urothelium were demonstrated in the IC/PBS group by histological study. IF staining showed the interruption of bladder urothelium in IC/PBS patients under confocal microscopy.Our data showed that decreased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) and interruption of bladder urothelium in IC/PBS patients. Treatment to repair the discontinuous urothelium may be useful to relieve some clinical symptoms of patients with IC/PBS.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445008","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.866004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.799015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.744544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.512999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.413535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tight junction","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Denudation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denudation"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Occludin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occludin"},{"name":"Tight junction protein 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction_protein_1"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Intermediate frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_frequency"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Classification of discontinuities","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_discontinuities"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Kamen Rider ZO","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_ZO"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
