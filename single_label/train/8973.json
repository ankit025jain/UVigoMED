{"id":8973,"title":"Effect of bovine adenovirus 3 on mitochondria.","abstract":"Viruses alter the structure and the function of mitochondria for survival. Electron microscopy analysis of the cells infected with bovine adenovirus 3 revealed extensive damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane characterized by dissolution of the cristae and amorphous appearance of mitochondrial matrix with little or no damage to the outer mitochondrial membrane. There were fewer cristae with altered morphology. Potential patches of protein synthesis machinary around mitochondria could be observed at 12Â hours post infection (hpi). At 24 hpi, the multi vascular bodies were evident throughout the infected cell. ATP production, mitochondrial Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) peaked at 18 hpi but decreased significantly at 24 hpi. This decrease coincided with the increased production of superoxide (SO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), at 24 hpi indicating acute oxidative stress in the cells and suggesting a complete failure of the cellular homeostatic machinary. The results reveal an intericate relationship between Ca2+ homeostasis, the ATP generation ability of cells, SO and ROS production, and regulation of MMP following infection by bovine adenovirus 3.
