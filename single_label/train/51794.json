{"id":51794,"title":"Testosterone supplementation versus clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism: an age matched comparison of satisfaction and efficacy.","abstract":"We compared satisfaction and treatment efficacy in men with symptomatic hypogonadism who received clomiphene citrate or testosterone supplementation therapy.Men treated with clomiphene citrate, or testosterone injections or gels for symptomatic hypogonadism (total testosterone less than 300 ng/dl) reported satisfaction with the current treatment regimen using the qADAM questionnaire.A total of 93 men on testosterone injections (31) or gels (31), or clomiphene citrate (31) were age matched from a retrospective cohort of 1,150 on testosterone supplementation therapy. We compared men who received testosterone supplementation therapy to 31 not on such therapy, who served as controls. Median serum testosterone increased from pretreatment levels in all men regardless of therapy with clomiphene citrate, and testosterone injections and gels (from 247 to 504, 224 to 1,104 and 230 to 412 ng/dl, respectively, p <0.05). Final median serum total testosterone in men on clomiphene citrate (504 ng/dl) was lower than in men receiving testosterone injections (1,014 ng/dl, p <0.01) but similar to that in men on testosterone gels (412 ng/dl, p = 0.31). Despite different serum testosterone levels men on all 3 therapies reported similar satisfaction on qADAM, including a score of 35 for clomiphene citrate, 39 for testosterone injections, 36 for testosterone gels and 34 for control treatment (p >0.05). Men receiving testosterone injections reported greater libido than men on clomiphene citrate (4 vs 3, p = 0.04) or testosterone gels (4 vs 3, p = 0.04), or controls (4 vs 3, p <0.01).Testosterone supplementation regimens and clomiphene citrate are efficacious for improving serum total testosterone. No difference in overall hypogonadal symptoms was noted among men on any testosterone supplementation therapy. Despite lower serum total testosterone, men on clomiphene citrate and testosterone gels reported satisfaction similar to that of men treated with testosterone injections.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657837","annotations":[{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.869931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Libido","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.721288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clomifene","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Androgen replacement therapy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"}]}
