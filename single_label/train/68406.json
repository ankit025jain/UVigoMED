{"id":68406,"title":"[Modern operative treatment possibilities in male stress urinary incontinence].","abstract":"Postprostatectomy incontinence (PPI) is one of the most feared complications of radical prostatectomy with major impact on quality of life and social well-being. In recent years due to improved surgical techniques a reduction of the postoperative incontinence rate was achieved. However, due to the increasing number of radical prostatectomies performed for prostate cancer, a substantial and increasing number of patients are suffering from postoperative stress urinary incontinence. If conservative treatment fails, surgical therapy is recommended. For decades, the artificial urinary sphincter was the reference standard for moderate to severe postoperative male stress urinary incontinence. However, patients' demand on minimally invasive treatment options is high. Age or advanced prostate cancer should not be an exclusion criterion for surgical treatment of persistent PPI.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522693","annotations":[{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.779953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.069656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
