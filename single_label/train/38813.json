{"id":38813,"title":"[Peculiarities of sexual behavior of female rats with hyperandrogenia in pubertal and postpubertal periods].","abstract":"The parameters of female and male sexual behavior in 3- and 6- month old female rats which were exposed to an androgen excess (subcutaneous implantation of Silastic capsules containing 5 mg of crystalline testosterone) from the beginning of pubertal period (at the age of 35 days), or within postpubertal period (at the age of 4 months). Hyperandrogenia in pubertal period had no effect on female sexual behavior formation, but it led to appearance of male behavior components in 100% of animals. In female rats which were implanted with testosterone capsules in postpubertal period, sexual disturbances were more pronounced and were characterized by masculinization and defeminization, which was due to a higher degree of androgenic saturation. The data obtained suggest a leading role of hyperandrogenemia in the pathogenesis of sexual behavior disturbances in female rats in different periods of individual development.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400561","annotations":[{"name":"Defeminization","weight":0.935706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeminization"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Virilization","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virilization"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.568265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hyperandrogenism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperandrogenism"},{"name":"Sporangium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporangium"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Silastic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silastic"},{"name":"Postgraduate education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
