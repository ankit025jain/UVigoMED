{"id":22651,"title":"Growth of Rickettsia felis in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells.","abstract":"Rickettsia felis is an obligate, intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the transitional group rickettsiae. This bacterium has been shown to grow in vitro in amphibian, tick, and mosquito cell lines. Here, we present data to show the growth of R. felis strain LSU in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, an embryonic, hemocytic cell line with phagocytic properties. R. felis LSU was isolated from Ixodes scapularis E6 (ISE6) cells and used to infect S2 cells, grown at 25Â°C. By 19 days postinfection, the S2 cells were 100% infected with R. felis as determined by Acridine Orange and Diff-Quik staining. A species-specific R. felis qPCR assay was used to demonstrate that the kinetics associated with the S2 cell culture infection involved a lag/adaptation phase, followed by continued growth to 20 days postinfection. Moreover, R. felis organisms were observed in the S2 cells using transmission electron microscopy and a polyclonal antibody against spotted fever rickettsiae. The ability to use D. melanogaster S2 cells for growing rickettsial agents is a useful tool owing to the ease of manipulation of the S2 cultures and the wide-ranging possibility of Drosophila resources available for future studies.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
