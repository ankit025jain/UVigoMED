{"id":77960,"title":"Auditory pathways' maturation after cochlear implant via cortical auditory evoked potentials.","abstract":"Evaluation of cortical auditory evoked potentials in children with cochlear implants has been proven to be an effective method for assessing cortical maturation after electrical stimulation.To analyze the changes in latency values of cortical auditory evoked potentials before and three months after cochlear implant use.This was a case-control study with a group of five children using cochlear implant awaiting activation of the electrodes, and a control group composed of five normal-hearing children. Auditory electrophysiological assessment was performed by the testing of the cortical auditory evoked potentials at two different periods: prior to cochlear implant activation and after three months of cochlear implant use.A significant decrease in the latency time of the P1 component was observed after three months of stimulation via cochlear implant, whose values were higher than those from the control group. The younger the child was at electrode activation, the greater the reduction in latency of the P1 component.Changes in the characteristics of cortical auditory evoked potentials can be observed in children who receive cochlear implants; these changes are related to the age of intervention, suggesting a rapid maturation of the auditory pathways after electrical stimulation.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830971","annotations":[{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.824228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.615388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.599321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.458966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.383037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"C1 & P1 (Neuroscience)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1_&_P1_(Neuroscience)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"},{"name":"Cochlear nuclei","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nuclei"}]}
