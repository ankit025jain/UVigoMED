{"id":79162,"title":"[Effect and safety analysis of Allergovit standardized mite allergen immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect and safety analysis of Allergovit standardized dust mite subcutaneous immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis.From Jan 2006 to Jan 2009,425 patients with persistent were treated with Allergovit standardized dust mite allergen in 3 years, which data were retrospectively analyzed. The scores of the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life were collected per-treatment and three years treatment. VAS (visual analogue scale) of all nasal symptoms and drug use scores were evaluated before treatment and every 6 weeks. The frequency of local and systemic reactions were recorded in the duration of dose escalation and maintenance.The Overall QOL were significantly improved after 3 years treatment [pre-treatment: 3.8 (2.9; 4.5); post-treatment: 1.1 (1.0; 2.0), P < 0.01]. VAS of all nasal symptoms and drug used scores decreased dramatically after escalation period [pro-treatment: 23. 7 (20.5; 27.8), 3.9 (3.2; 4.7); post-treatment: 2.1 (1.6; 2.2), 0(0;0), P < 0.01]. Local reaction's rate was 3.15%, the frequency systemic reaction's rate was 0.90%.The standardized specific allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis is safe and effective.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479356","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.777944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.651338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"House dust mite","weight":0.467061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.346942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.345303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.325848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Allergen immunotherapy","weight":0.281268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Escalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 425","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_425"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
