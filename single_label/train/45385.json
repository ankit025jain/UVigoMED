{"id":45385,"title":"Using a yeast two-hybrid system to identify FTCD as a new regulator for HIF-1? in HepG2 cells.","abstract":"HIF-1? is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathologies. Here, we screened a human liver cDNA library for HIF-1?-interacting partners using a yeast two-hybrid system. We identified 53 genes, including formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, our data indicated that HIF-1? mediated the effects of hypoxia on FTCD induction via binding to the hypoxia-responsive elements of the FTCD promoter. Knockdown of FTCD reduced the effects of HIF-1? in hypoxia and enhanced chemosensitivity in HepG2 cells. Our findings suggested crosstalk between FTCD and HIF signaling and promoted HCC progression, thus implicating FTCD as a therapeutic target for HCC.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686083","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.831683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.810658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.796025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.712928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.361749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"CDNA library","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDNA_library"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"Hep G2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep_G2"},{"name":"Crosstalk (electronics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(electronics)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"}]}
