{"id":68558,"title":"Polyclonal antithymocyte globulin and cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant recipients.","abstract":"T-lymphocyte activation may contribute to atherosclerosis, the prevalence of which is increased in transplant patients. However, the cardiovascular consequences of polyclonal antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-induced immune modifications, which include alterations in T-cell subsets, are unknown. We conducted a retrospective single-center study to assess whether ATG associates with an increased incidence of atherosclerotic events (CVEs) in kidney transplant patients. Propensity score analysis was performed to address potential confounding by indication. We also tested whether ATG use induces a proatherogenic immune status. Sixty-nine (12.2%) CVEs occurred during follow-up (87Â±31 months). The cumulative incidence of CVEs was higher in ATG-treated patients (14.7% versus 8.2%; P=0.03). Cox regression analysis revealed that ATG use was an independent risk factor for CVEs (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.35 to 4.13; P=0.003). Results obtained in the propensity score match analysis recapitulated those obtained from the overall cohort (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.98; P=0.02). Late-stage differentiated CD8(+) T cells increased 1 year after transplantation only in ATG-treated patients. More generally, ATG associated with features of immune activation. These modifications increased markedly in patients exposed to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Subanalyses suggest that the effect of ATG on CVEs is restricted to CMV-exposed patients. However, CMV infection associated significantly with CVEs only in ATG-treated patients (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.70; P=0.01). In conclusion, ATG associated with both immune activation and post-transplant CVEs in this cohort. Further studies should precisely determine whether ATG-induced immune activation is the causal link between ATG and CVEs.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511120","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.877613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.87016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.78674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.774204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.741328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.705167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.589967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.422422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.374684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.133549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Propensity probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_probability"}]}
