{"id":29918,"title":"Clinical pharmacist's role in implementing a smoking cessation intervention in a Swiss regional hospital: an exploratory study.","abstract":"Smoking cessation represents one of the best means of preventing smoking-related complications. In recent years, a majority of hospitals have implemented smoke-free policies, making support for smoker patients a necessary and indispensable task. The clinical pharmacist is well-positioned to provide this kind of support, given a good understanding of the medical condition and pharmacotherapy of hospitalized patients and the possibility to acquire specific smoking cessation training.This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a smoking cessation intervention for hospitalized patients by a clinical pharmacist previously trained for smoking cessation counselling.Internal medicine department of a Swiss regional hospital.Smoker patients hospitalized in this department were included in the study from mid-September 2012 to mid-January 2013, according to the inclusion criteria. Moderate-intensity smoking cessation interventions based on smoking counselling and motivational interviewing techniques were used, and a follow-up telephone call at least 1 month after discharge was made. Patients' pharmacotherapy was analysed with regards to interactions with tobacco smoke.Motivational stage, abstinence at follow-up, change of readiness to quit between hospital visit and follow-up, patients' evaluation of the programme, pharmacotherapy interventions.One hundred smoker patients were screened, of whom 41 received the intervention and 40 received a follow-up contact. At least 1 month after discharge, the readiness to quit of 53 % of patients improved and 33 % of patients declared themselves abstinent. Even though 35 % of patients declared having mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms in hospital, only 15 % were interested in receiving nicotine replacement therapy. Study participants evaluated the intervention positively.A moderate-intensity smoking cessation intervention in hospitalized patients was associated with a higher quit rate than in control groups from other studies, and their readiness to quit generally improved at least 1 month after hospital discharge. A clinical pharmacist trained for smoking cessation counselling can play a key role in providing such interventions, including the assessment of pharmacotherapy interactions with tobacco smoke.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590920","annotations":[{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nicotine replacement therapy","weight":0.78128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.610151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.581217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.435869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.435293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motivational interviewing","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_interviewing"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical pharmacy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacy"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Smoker","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoker"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}]}
