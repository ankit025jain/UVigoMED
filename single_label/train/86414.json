{"id":86414,"title":"Efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors versus chemotherapy as second-line treatment in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with wild-type EGFR: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.","abstract":"EGFR mutation status is closely related to the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR-TKIs have become the standard first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutation NSCLC, while for EGFR wild-type tumors, the preferred first-line treatment is chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs as second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type NSCLC remains controversial. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of EGFR-TKI as second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type NSCLC.Randomized controlled trials that compared EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy in previously treated advanced NSCLC with wild-type EGFR were included. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of EGFR-TKIs compared with standard chemotherapy. The endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR).Six randomized controlled trials with a total of 990 patients with wild-type EGFR were included: 499 in the EGFR-TKIs group and 491 in the chemotherapy group. The results indicated that in the second-line treatment of EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC, PFS was significantly inferior in the EGFR-TKIs group versus the chemotherapy group (HR=1.37, 95% CI=1.20-1.56, P<0.00001). However, this significant difference did not translate into OS (HR=1.02, 95% CI=0.87-1.20, P=0.81). ORR tended to favor chemotherapy but there was no significant difference compared with EGFR-TKI (RR=1.77, 95% CI=0.90-3.50, P=0.10).Chemotherapy improves PFS significantly but not OS, compared with EGFR-TKIs as a second-line treatment in advanced NSCLC with wild-type EGFR. Whether EGFR-TKIs should be used in EGFR wild-type patients should be considered carefully.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780111","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.295775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"}]}
