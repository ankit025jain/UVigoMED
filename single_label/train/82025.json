{"id":82025,"title":"Comparison of oral health among older people with and without dementia.","abstract":"Older people with dementia are very dependent on nursing, and caregivers are frequently confronted with oral-care-resistant behaviour which may lead to shortcomings in oral health.To compare oral hygiene and health status of institutionalised older people suffering, or not, from dementia.Prospective cohort study (single-blind).Institutionalised older population in south-west Germany.Ninety-three, allocated to two groups: dementia (n = 57) and non-dementia (n = 36) based on a mini mental state examination.Target variables were plaque control record (PCR), gingival bleeding index (GBI), community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN), and denture hygiene index (DHI). Differences between the dementia and non-dementia groups were evaluated by univariate testing of all target variables.Univariate analysis revealed the amount of plaque in the dementia group was significantly higher than in the non-dementia group (p = 0.004). Mean CPITN of participants in the dementia group was significantly worse than those of participants in the non-dementia group (p < 0.001). All participants in the dementia group had periodontitis in at least one of the sextants, compared with 74% in the non-dementia group (p < 0.001). For DHI (p = 0.198) and GBI (p = 0.275) no differences were found between the groups.Some aspects of oral hygiene and health seem to be worse for the institutionalised older people with dementia. Permanent specially adapted intervention for residents suffering from dementia in long-term care homes, and training for caregivers, is desirable to maintain life-long oral hygiene and health.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741890","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.737676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.587278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mental status examination","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_status_examination"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.561506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.489966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.474575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.395345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.38781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.297966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.213707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Institutionalisation","weight":0.0354391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalisation"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
