{"id":30675,"title":"Implementing and evaluating the German adaptation of the \"Strengthening Families Program 10 - 14\"- a randomized-controlled multicentre study.","abstract":"Substance use problems in childhood and adolescence can severely impact youth's physical and mental well-being. When substance use is initiated early, the risk for moving from hazardous substance use to substance use disorders (SUD) is particularly high to developmentally induced biological and psychological vulnerability towards chronic trajectories in youth. Thus, risk factors for developing SUD should be addressed early in life by adequate preventive measures reaching out to children, adolescents, and their families. The study described in this protocol will test the effectiveness of the German adaptation of the Strengthening Families Program for Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP 10-14) aimed at ten to 14 year old adolescents and their caregivers.The study is conducted in four large German cities by counselling centres in the areas of youth welfare, social work and addiction aid. The effectiveness of the manualised group programme \"Familien St√§rken\" consisting of seven sessions and four booster-sessions is tested among N?=?288 children and participating parents in a multicentre randomised controlled trial with standardised assessment instruments. The control condition receives a minimal 2-hour intervention on parenting delivered in a school setting. Data are collected shortly before and after as well as six and 18 months after the intervention. We expect to replicate the favourable effects of the SFP 10-14 programme in the United States in the area of substance use initiation, family functioning and individual psychosocial adjustment.The trial is expected to contribute to the growing literature on family-based preventive interventions, their effectiveness and feasibility. It is in line with several other current European efforts aimed at strengthening families against the detrimental effects of substance abuse in youth. The results of these trials will expand our knowledge on adapting evidence-based interventions and delivering them in diverse cultures and settings.Current Controlled Trials
