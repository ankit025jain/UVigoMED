{"id":33551,"title":"Detecting familial hypercholesterolaemia in the community: impact of a telephone call from a chemical pathologist to the requesting general practitioner.","abstract":"To determine whether a telephone call from a chemical pathologist to the requesting general practitioner (GP) of individuals at high risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) increases specialist referral and detection of FH.Individuals with an LDL-cholesterol ? 6.5 mmol/L without secondary causes were identified from a community laboratory; 100 cases and 96 historical controls. All laboratory reports (cases and controls) received interpretative comments highlighting FH. In addition, the cases' GPs received a telephone call from the chemical pathologist to highlight their patient's risk of FH and suggest specialist referral, whereas with the controls' GPs were not telephoned.After 12 months follow-up, 27 (27%) cases were referred to clinic compared with 4 (4%) controls (p < 0.0001). 25 cases were reviewed at clinic, 12 (48%) had definite FH and 18 (72%) had probable or definite FH according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria, 2 cases did not attend their clinic appointments. Genetic testing was performed in 23 individuals: 7 (30%) had pathogenic FH mutations. Genotypic cascade screening of 4 kindreds from the intervention group detected an additional 7 individuals with FH and excluded 5 mutation-negative family members.A telephone call from a chemical pathologist to the requesting GP of patients at high risk of FH was associated with significantly higher rates of FH detection and specialist referral. Over 70% of individuals with an LDL-cholesterol ? 6.5 mmol/L were diagnosed with FH. However, further investigation is required to improve the relatively low referral rate.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814411","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.871844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.808209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.682824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.569012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.469893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.46082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"History","weight":0.246946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.212801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Familial hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Waterfall","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall"},{"name":"Telephone call","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_call"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clan","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"Interpretative phenomenological analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretative_phenomenological_analysis"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
