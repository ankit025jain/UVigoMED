{"id":1066,"title":"The \"STEMI code\"- interventions to reduce time to reperfusion therapy: a novel approach and review of the literature.","abstract":"ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common presentation in the Emergency Room. Proper treatment requires precision and time saving procedures. Hospitals around the world are currently developing STEMI protocols to optimize this process since mortality and morbidity increase with time without treatment. These protocols may involve Percutaneous Interventions (PCI), fibrinolytics or both, to optimize outcomes. Protocols utilize different methods and techniques to improve Door-to-Balloon time. It is well established that PCI provides improved mortality with a lower complication rate when compared to fibrinolytic therapy, lack of availability being its biggest obstacle. Only a few PCI capable facilities are available and networking protocols are required to improve STEMI management in Puerto Rico- an area that needs vast improvement. Strategies that seek to reduce the intervention times are being evaluated and implemented throughout the world. We present an approach implemented at a local hospital called \"STEMI Code\".","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470913","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.723532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.509643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.481203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.468279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.45569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.133784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0526148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.0499999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Thrombolytic drug","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolytic_drug"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"}]}
