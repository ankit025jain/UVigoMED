{"id":68698,"title":"Categorizing intraoperative complications of retrograde intrarenal surgery.","abstract":"To review our intraoperative complications of retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for kidney calculi and stratify these complications according to the modified Satava classification system (SCS).230 patients (119 males, 111 females) who underwent RIRS because of kidney calculi were analyzed. We documented and stratified the intraoperative complications according to the modified SCS. There are four grades for this classification: grade 1 complications include events without consequences for patients; grade 2a complications include events that could be treated with endoscopic surgery intraoperatively; grade 2b complications include events which were treated with endoscopic treatment in another session, and grade 3 describes the events requiring laparoscopic or open surgery.Mean age was 39.1 years (range 1-78). The stone-free rate after one session was 81%. Intraoperative complications were recorded in 30.4% of the patients. According to the modified SCS, grade 1 complications were documented in 15.9%, grade 2a complications were documented in 5.6%, and grade 2b complications were documented in 8.9% of the patients. Grade 3 complications were not detected in any of the patients.In our opinion, the modified SCS can facilitate patients to understand the safety of this surgery and can make it easier to compare the results of different institutes and surgeons.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503707","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.571418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.471068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.359541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.209391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0621105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Satava","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satava"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"First grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
