{"id":22779,"title":"Mediastinitis due to Gram-negative bacteria is associated with increased mortality.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to describe the features of a large cohort of patients with postoperative mediastinitis, with particular regard to Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), and assess their outcome. This bicentric retrospective cohort included all patients who were hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit with mediastinitis after cardiac surgery during a 9-year period. Three hundred and nine patients developed a mediastinitis with a mean age of 65 years and a mean standard Euroscore of six points. Ninety-one patients (29.4%) developed a GNB mediastinitis (GNBm). Of the 364 pathogens involved, 103 GNB were identified. GNBm were more frequently polymicrobial (44% versus 3.2%; p <0.001). Being female was the sole independent risk factor of GNBm in multivariate analysis. Initial antimicrobial therapy was significantly more frequently inappropriate with GNBm compared with other microorganisms (24.6% versus 1.9%; p <0.001). Independent risk factors for inappropriateness of initial antimicrobial treatment were GNBm (OR = 8.58, 95%CI 2.53-29.02, p 0.0006), and polymicrobial mediastinitis (OR = 4.52, 95%CI 1.68-12.12, p 0.0028). GNBm were associated with more drainage failure, secondary infection, need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and/or use of vasopressors. Thirty-day hospital mortality was significantly higher with GNBm (31.9 % versus 17.0%; p 0.004). GNBm was identified as an independent risk factor of hospital mortality (OR = 2.31, 95%CI 1.16-4.61, p 0.0179).","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520879","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.47037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.425574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.408437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.370339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Mediastinitis","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinitis"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Secondary infection","weight":0.0540804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_infection"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.032721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"364","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/364"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Good News Bible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_News_Bible"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
