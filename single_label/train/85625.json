{"id":85625,"title":"Medical and interventional options to treat pulmonary embolism.","abstract":"Venous thromboembolism remains one of the most common conditions. Pulmonary embolism carries a mortality rate of over 15 % in the first 3 months after diagnosis. Venous thromboembolism is the fourth leading cause of death in the Western world, and the third leading cause of cardiovascular death trailing myocardial infarction and stroke. This section highlights the medical and interventional options presently available to treat this potentially lethal disease.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890764","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.448933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.217298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"}]}
