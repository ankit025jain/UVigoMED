{"id":91757,"title":"A new method for muscle fatigue assessment: Online model identification techniques.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to propose a method that allows extraction of the current muscle state under electrically induced fatigue.The triceps surae muscle of 5 subjects paralyzed by spinal cord injury was fatigued by intermittent electrical stimulation (5 Ã— 5 trains at 30 Hz). Classical fatigue indices representing muscle contractile properties [peak twitch (Pt) and half-relaxation time (HRT)] were assessed before and after each 5-train series and were used to identify 2 relevant parameters (Fm , Ur ) of a previously developed mathematical model using the Sigma-Point Kalman Filter.Pt declined significantly during the protocol, whereas HRT remained unchanged. Identification of the model parameters with experimental data yielded a model-based fatigue assessment that gave a more stable evaluation of fatigue than classical parameters.This work reinforces clinical research by providing a tool that clinicians can use to monitor fatigue development during stimulation.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Wounds and
