{"id":89590,"title":"[How much are hand injuries worth?].","abstract":"Hand injuries are some of the most commonly treated injuries at trauma emergency services. Their treatment may be costly and even more so when inappropriate treatment results in complications. The amount paid for the treatment of this kind of injuries may increase dramatically if one considers the direct costs (medical care) and the indirect costs (compensation-loss of profits) resulting from the severity of damage and its sequelae. The objective of this paper is to reveal certain figures that help measure the economic impact that these injuries represent and find ways to optimize resources, minimize costs and improve the care of these patients.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701778","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.423913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency service","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Profit (accounting)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Indirect costs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
