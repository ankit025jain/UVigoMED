{"id":46274,"title":"Transforming growth factor-? as a therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in patients as a consequence of long-standing preexisting liver illnesses, including viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or metabolic disease. In such preexisting liver diseases, TGF-? plays an important role in orchestrating a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell growth and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). TGF-? signaling promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by two mechanisms: first, via an intrinsic activity as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor and, second, via an extrinsic activity by inducing microenvironment changes, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, T regulatory cells, and inflammatory mediators. Although there is an increasing understanding on how TGF-? signaling is associated with tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma, it is not clear whether TGF-? signaling is limited to a certain subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or is a key driver of hepatocellular carcinoma during the entire tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Inhibitors of the TGF-? signaling have been shown to block hepatocellular carcinoma growth and progression by modulating EMT in different experimental models, leading to the clinical investigation of the TGF-? inhibitor LY2157299 monohydrate in hepatocellular carcinoma. Preliminary results from a phase II clinical trial have shown improved clinical outcome and also changes consistent with a reduction of EMT.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638984","annotations":[{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Paracrine signalling","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signalling"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.768283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.766442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.639076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.631563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.567305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.526962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.432345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Transition metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"},{"name":"Hydrate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"}]}
