{"id":86683,"title":"New onset right ventricular enlargement in recent dyspnea: Is echocardiography enough for a diagnosis of pulmonary thrombo-embolism?","abstract":"Pulmonary embolism may be often promptly diagnosed just by bedside echocardiography, in the case of new onset severe right ventricular enlargement, increased pulmonary pressure and dyspnea. However, CT confirmation could be required in the presence of contrasting findings during diagnostic work up. We report the case of a 79-year old woman who presented with acute dyspnea, right ventricular enlargement and leftward septal shift. Despite first diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, an irregular mass was detected at CT scan in mid left lung, apparently infiltrating left pulmonary artery branches, without signs of evident pulmonary thrombo-embolism. Visceral pleural and lymphonodular infiltration suspected for malignancy was also present. We hypothesize that acutely increased pulmonary pressures and enlarged right ventricle were caused by the infiltrating pulmonary mass, presumably a lung tumor, partly involving left pulmonary artery branches and by tumor pulmonary embolism. A diagnosis of pulmonary thrombo-embolism exclusively based on echocardiography may be occasionally misleading without a careful diagnostic work-up.
