{"id":30145,"title":"In vivo effect of apomorphine and haloperidol on MPP neurotoxicity.","abstract":"The involvement of dopaminergic (DAergic) receptor drugs in the neuroprotection against the neurotoxic action of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) in the DAergic terminals in striatum was studied using an intracerebral microdialysis technique. Twenty-four hours after surgery (day 1), apomorphine and haloperidol, alone or with 1 mmol/l of MPP(+) perfusion through the microdialysis probe, were systemically administered. Forty-eight hours after surgery (day 2), 1 mmol/l of MPP(+) was perfused for 15 min in all groups of animals and the output of dopamine was measured. The amount of dopamine was directly proportional to the remaining striatal DAergic terminals. The results show that: (1) subcutaneous administration of apomorphine before MPP(+) perfusion prevented MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity, and (2) intraperitoneal administration of haloperidol before MPP(+) perfusion did not prevent MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556705","annotations":[{"name":"Haloperidol","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloperidol"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.696885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.601632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.459182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Apomorphine","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomorphine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.184057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Microdialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdialysis"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Provincial_Parliament_(Ontario)"},{"name":"Output","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output"}]}
