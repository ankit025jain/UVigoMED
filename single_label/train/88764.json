{"id":88764,"title":"Why don't patients adhere to compression therapy?","abstract":"This article explores the psychological influences on patients and their choices over adopting (or not) the advice of health-care professionals (HCPs) with regard to their own health. The article will examine some key theories by reviewing studies as well as examining how the patient-HCP relationship has evolved over time to try and improve patient adherence. Although specifically focusing on the area of venous leg ulcers and compression therapy, the theories relate to many health conditions. Despite health advice and compression treatments being the cornerstone of ulcer prevention and recurrence when adhered to, patient adherence levels are often persistently poor, both anecdotally and via clinical study. This article attempts to explain what influences a patient's adherence.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796083","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.630781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.558272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.212913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.211952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Anecdotal evidence","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Self care","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_care"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Venous ulcer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_ulcer"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Cold compression therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_compression_therapy"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Cornerstone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone"}]}
