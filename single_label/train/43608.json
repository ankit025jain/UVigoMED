{"id":43608,"title":"Developing a decision-making model based on an interdisciplinary oncological care group for the management of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"To report our experience on implementation and preliminary results of a decision-making model based on the recommendations of an Interdisciplinary Oncological Care Group developed for the management of colorectal cancer.The multidisciplinary team identified a reference guideline using appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREE) tool based on a sequential assessment of the guideline quality. Thereafter, internal guidelines with diagnostic and therapeutic management for early, locally advanced and metastatic colonic and rectal cancer were drafted; organizational aspects, responsibility matrices, protocol actions for each area of specialty involved and indicators for performing audits were also defined.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) UK guideline was the reference for drafting the internal guideline document; from February to November 2013, 125 patients with colorectal cancer were discussed by and taken under the care of the Interdisciplinary Oncological Care Group. The first audit performed in December 2013 revealed optimal adherence to the internal guideline, mainly in terms of uniformity and accuracy of perioperative staging, coordination and timing of multi-modal therapies. To date, all patients under observation are within the diagnostic and therapeutic course, no patient came out from the multidisciplinary \"path\" and only in 14% of cases have the first recommendations proposed been changed. The selected indicators appear effective and reliable, while at the moment, it is not yet possible to assess the impact of the multidisciplinary team on clinical outcome.Although having a short observation period, our model seems capable of determining optimal uniformity of diagnostic and therapeutic management, to a high degree of patient satisfaction. A longer observation period is necessary in order to confirm these observations and for assessing the impact on clinical outcome.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778070","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.627589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.62,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.603014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.422917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Coming out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
