{"id":52724,"title":"Nurse perceptions of the Diabetes Get Checked programme.","abstract":"The Diabetes Get Checked programme provided a free annual diabetes check to people diagnosed with diabetes. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the impact this programme had on the practice of nurses; identify factors that nurses consider contributed to the success or failure of the programme in their work setting; and to elicit nurses' suggestions for future improved management and outcomes for people with diabetes.An observational study utilising an online survey was undertaken. A total of 748 people completed the survey - the majority being nurses. Data were analysed descriptively.The Diabetes Get Checked programme was shown to have had a substantial impact on the practice of nurses, enabling the development of new models of nursing care, improved educational levels among nurses (and doctors), improved confidence in the management of diabetes, and increased satisfaction in their work. Nurses in the study suggested future interventions and programmes designed to support people with diabetes. These include implementation of a multi-disciplinary wrap-around approach, enhanced case management and self-management, implementing direct funding for nurse-led services, and improving population-based approaches such as policy changes and social marketing.The study sought nurse's perspectives with regard to a recently terminated programme designed to provide care to people with diabetes. It identified areas that worked well in programme implementation and those that could be improved. These findings provide useful information for funders and planners developing new programmes designed to support people with diabetes.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575607","annotations":[{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.473576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.396419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.394889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.384485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.370077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Social marketing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"Checking (ice hockey)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Foreign policy of the George W.
