{"id":20366,"title":"Changes in meningococcal C epidemiology and vaccine effectiveness after vaccine introduction and schedule modification.","abstract":"Meningococcal C conjugate vaccine was included in December 2000 in the Spanish childhood vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. In 2006, routine vaccination was modified to two doses at 2 and 4-6 months and a booster dose during the second year of age. Additionally, successive catch-up campaigns were launched to extend protection to older groups. This study provides long-term information about the vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the impact of vaccination in meningococcal C disease epidemiology in Spain.We assessed surveillance data from season 1996/97 to season 2012/13 to describe changes in incidence and lethality of the disease. The vaccine-effectiveness study covered all cases notified from January 1st of 2001 onwards and evaluated vaccine effectiveness in both routines and in catch-up campaigns. To investigate the decline in protection over time, we compared the vaccine effectiveness within 1 year and more than one year since vaccination.The incidence of meningococcal serogroup C disease decreased first in those age-groups targeted for vaccination. But after 2006/07 season the decrease in incidence was generalised. Vaccine effectiveness was high in all vaccination programmes, although 2, 4-6 months (+ booster dose) routine showed higher overall vaccine effectiveness than 2, 4 and 6 months routine (99.3% vs. 90.2%). VE >1 year since vaccination was lower in 2, 4 and 6 months compared to 2 and 4-6 months (+ booster) routine (81.4% vs. 89.1%). For catch-up campaigns, VE increased and loss of VE decreased with the age of administration. Overall VE was 94.83 (CI95%: 93.37, 95.97), 98.82 (CI95%: 97.96, 99.31) and 90.89 (CI95%: 87.79, 93.21) for ? 1 and >1 year since vaccination, respectively.The meningococcal C conjugate vaccination programme has been extremely successful in controlling the disease and continues to be evaluated and adapted to the changes in the epidemiology of the disease to ensure long-term vaccine protection.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662700","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.810842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.44291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.32253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Ship naming and launching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching"},{"name":"Ketchup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"}]}
