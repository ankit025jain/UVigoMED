{"id":43954,"title":"Pluronic-poly[alpha-(4-aminobutyl)-1-glycolic acid] polymeric micelle-like nanoparticles as carrier for drug delivery.","abstract":"Pluronic-poly[alpha-(4-aminobutyl)-1-glycolic acid] (Pluronic-PAGA) with different types of Pluronic, the different molecule weight of PAGA, and the different molar ratios of Pluronic to PAGA were synthesized. These materials were bio-degradable, amphiphilic, could be degraded into non-toxic small molecules and could be used to carry drugs. 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) loaded Pluronic-PAGA micelle-like nanoparticles (5-Fu loaded P-PAGA NPs) were prepared by a simple self-assembly method, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscope. The degradation and release characteristics have also been studied in this paper. With the time passing, the 5-Fu loaded P-PAGA NPs degraded into smaller ones with the similar characteristics of the original NPs. Both the types of Pluronic and the molecule weight of the PAGA affected the releasing progresses. It was found that 5-Fu loaded P-PAGA NPs exhibited high growth inhibitory effect on human gastric cancer cells by MTT assay. The cellular uptake of Rhodamine B loaded P-PAGA NPs was higher than free Rhodamine B. This study suggested that the Pluronic-PAGA with acceptable drug entrapment efficiencies, drug loading efficiencies and tunable release profiles could offer an alternative carrier for 5-Fu delivery and have the potential for the delivery of other anti-tumour drug.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757952","annotations":[{"name":"Amphiphile","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphile"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.850298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.792177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.695154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.554481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Small molecule","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule"},{"name":"Dynamic light scattering","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_light_scattering"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.222361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Rhodamine","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodamine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Light scattering","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_scattering"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Glycolic acid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolic_acid"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.0197932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Fuel efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency"},{"name":"Transmission (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Tunable laser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunable_laser"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
