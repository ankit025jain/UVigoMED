{"id":63749,"title":"Nonadenomatous nonencapsulated thymic parathyroid tissue concomitant with primary hyperparathyroidism due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma.","abstract":"Primary hyperparathyroidism due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma is not infrequent. Primary hyperparathyroidism caused by unusual thymic nonadenomatous nonencapsulated parathyroid tissue has been reported before. Both can cause unsuccessful neck explorations. Here we presented for the first time a patient with hyperparathyroidism due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma concomitant to the presence of thymic nonadenomatous nonencapsulated parathyroid tissue.
