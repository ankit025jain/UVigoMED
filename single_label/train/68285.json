{"id":68285,"title":"Lycopene for the prevention and treatment of prostate disease.","abstract":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer are common diseases of the prostate gland. BPH is commonly treated by pharmaceutical products, which commonly improve symptoms but are often off-set by adverse events including erectile dysfunction, which affect quality of life. Similarly, a variety of treatment options exist for the treatment of prostate cancer. The applicability of these prostate cancer treatments is reliant on stage of disease. Whilst effectiveness of prostate cancer treatments may vary, common adverse effects include erectile dysfunction, incontinence and lower quality of life. Early evidence from systematic reviews has suggested that diet and lifestyle factors may be beneficial in reducing the risk of cancer. Lycopene, a member of the carotenoid family, found commonly in red pigmented fruit and vegetables has been established as having strong antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties. This chapter examines the current evidence on the use of lycopene as a preventive agent for prostate disease.
