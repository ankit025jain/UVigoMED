{"id":17402,"title":"Lipocalin 2 in cerebrospinal fluid as a marker of acute bacterial meningitis.","abstract":"Early differential diagnosis between acute bacterial and viral meningitis is problematic. We aimed to investigate whether the detection of lipocalin 2, a protein of the acute innate immunity response, may be used as a marker for acute bacterial meningitis.Transgenic mice expressing the human transferrin were infected by intraperitoneal route and were imaged. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sampled up to 48hours post- infection to measure lipocalin 2. We also tested a collection of 90 and 44 human CSF with confirmed acute bacterial or acute viral meningitis respectively.Lipocalin 2 was detected after 5 h in CSF during experimental infection in mice. Lipocalin 2 levels were significantly higher (p?<?0.0001) in patients with confirmed acute bacterial meningitis (mean 125 pg/mL, range 106-145 pg/mL) than in patients with acute viral meningitis (mean 2 pg/mL, range 0-6 pg/mL) with a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 71% in diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis.Increased levels of lipocalin 2 in cerebrospinal fluid may discriminate between acute bacterial and viral meningitis in patients with clinical syndrome of meningitis.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885531","annotations":[{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.84863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.757118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.582997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.406238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.392724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Bacterial meningitis","weight":0.220727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_meningitis"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.20264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Viral meningitis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_meningitis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
