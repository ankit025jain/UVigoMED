{"id":63875,"title":"A pilot study for the detection of FLT3-ITD mutation frequency in 25 Iraqi patients with acute lymphoid leukemia in 2 Iraqi hospitals.","abstract":"This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency of FLT3-ITD mutation in acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in Iraq, and to correlate this mutation with prognostic parameters of patients. A total of 25 individuals were enrolled (16 children with ALL and 9 adult with ALL), attending 2 teaching hospitals in Baghdad. Hematological investigations including complete blood picture, and bone marrow aspiration were performed. FLT3-ITD mutation was detected utilizing conventional PCR technology using specific primers. Two of 25 ALL patients (8%) showed a mutated band of FLT3-ITD mutation representing 12.5% of pediatric patients, and all the other ALL cases showed the absence of this mutation. These cases were an 8-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy, L2 subtype, who had achieved complete hematological remission throughout the study. In conclusion, FLT3-ITD mutation was found in 2 morphologically appearing pediatric ALL patients that was higher than previously reported worldwide. Bilineage cases could not be excluded owing to absence of flow cytometer analysis. A larger number of Iraqi ALL patients confirmed by flow cytometer is necessary to evaluate the prognostic effect of this mutation in pediatric age group, especially FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors might represent a promising target in ALL patients and can be used as minimal residual disease marker.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
