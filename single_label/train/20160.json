{"id":20160,"title":"Antibacterial activity of new oxazolidin-2-one analogues in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infections. The purpose of this study was the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of 10 new 3-oxazolidin-2-one analogues on 12 methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates. S. aureus confirmation was achieved via catalase and coagulase test. Molecular characterization of MRSA was performed by amplification of the mecA gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated via the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion susceptibility test protocol, using commonly applied antibiotics and the oxazolidinone analogues. Only (R)-5-((S)-1-dibenzylaminoethyl)-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (7a) exhibited antibacterial activity at 6.6 ?g. These results, allow us to infer that molecules such as 7a can be potentially used to treat infections caused by MRSA strains.
