{"id":43241,"title":"MicroRNAs 146a and 147b biomarkers for colorectal tumor's localization.","abstract":"The recently identified class of microRNAs (miRs) provided a new insight into cancer research, since abnormalities of members of microRNAs family have been found in various types of cancer. However, the relationship between five miRNAs (miR146a, miR155, miR21, miR135a, and miR147b) and colorectal cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we examined expression of these miRNAs in 25 pair-matched colon cancer tissues and normal colon mucosa. The expression levels of miR146a, miR155, miR21, miR135a, and miR147b were quantified by real-time PCR. We found that miR21, miR146a, and miR135a were all expressed at higher levels in colon tumors. On the other hand, miR146a and miR147b expressions are significantly higher in left colon compared to right colon. These two miRs, especially miR146a, seemed to be markers for the left colon tumors. Moreover, significant proportional and inverse correlations were found between miR expressions in tumor and healthy tissue, and the correlations profiles were different depending on cancer localization. Taken together, these results lead us to suggest the presence of different mechanisms regulating miRs expression and consequently their target genes in left and right colon. So the pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis would be different according to the site of the tumor.
