{"id":80535,"title":"Seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in blood donors and Chagas cardiomyopathy in patients from the coal mining region of Coahuila, Mexico.","abstract":"Chagas disease is considered a worldwide emerging disease; it is endemic in Mexico and the state of Coahuila and is considered of little relevance. The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in blood donors and Chagas cardiomyopathy in patients from the coal mining region of Coahuila, Mexico.Epidemiological, exploratory and prospective study in a general hospital during the period January to June 2011.We performed laboratory tests ELISA and indirect hemagglutination in three groups of individuals: 1) asymptomatic voluntary blood donors, 2) patients hospitalized in the cardiology department and 3) patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.There were three levels of seroprevalence: 0.31% in asymptomatic individuals, 1.25% in cardiac patients and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in 21.14%.In spite of having detected autochthonous cases of Chagas disease, its importance to local public health remains to be established as well as the details of the dynamics of transmission so that the study is still in progress.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626421","annotations":[{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.932498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.715275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.507659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.50247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.478533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.439051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.376714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Coal mining","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.364373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Coal","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Coahuila","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coahuila"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
