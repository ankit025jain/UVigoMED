{"id":82103,"title":"Impact of periodontal disease and periodontal therapy on oral health-related quality of life.","abstract":"To determine the impact of periodontal disease and periodontal therapy on oral health-related quality of life using the German version of the Oral Health Impact Profile, taking into account the possible effects of age, gender and socioeconomic factors.This is a study of 93 patients of both sexes aged 27-74 years. The sample included 82 patients with a diagnosis of periodontal diseases, 11 patients without periodontitis (control group). All patients used the German 14-item version of the Oral Health Impact Profile, as well as a socioeconomic and demographic questionnaire. This was used to assess oral health-related quality of life issues. The questionnaire and clinical inspection were done before and 6-8 weeks after the periodontal treatment.Periodontal diseases have an effect on oral health-related quality of life issues. Scores for the German 14-item version of the Oral Health Impact Profile were associated with severity of periodontal diseases, sex, age, oral hygiene and smoking habits. The highest scores included those patients with a probing pocket depth of > 7 mm. The median score of these patients was reduced from 14.4 at baseline to 5.5 after treatment (P = 0.007). These patients perceived physical, social and psychological changes in oral health-related quality of life after periodontal therapy. Median OHIP-G-14 scores were reduced from 6.3 at baseline to 4.8 6-8 weeks after treatment (P < 0.001). The number of teeth with a probing pocket depth > 3 mm could be reduced from 76.0% at baseline to 27.6% after treatment.The association between periodontal diseases and the oral health-related quality of life was determined. The positive effect of the periodontal treatment on the oral health related quality of life was also shown and was most pronounced for patients with a probing pocket depth of > 7 mm.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716244","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.37023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.334177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.29901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.233519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.193164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"German language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Inspection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection"},{"name":"Gingival and periodontal pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_and_periodontal_pocket"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"}]}
