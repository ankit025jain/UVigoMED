{"id":24058,"title":"Congenital malalignment of the great toenail. Report of two cases.","abstract":"Congenital malalignment of the great toenail is characterized by lateral deviation of nail plates, which are not parallel to the distal phalanx. We report two cases of congenital malalignment of the great toenail in two otherwise healthy children. Because this entity is probably underdiagnosed, a high index of suspicion is required to prevent from diagnostic errors and unnecessary treatments.
