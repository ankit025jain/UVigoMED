{"id":91795,"title":"[Housing Project 'Living Independently with Intensive Support (WmI)': The Scientific Evaluation].","abstract":"In Germany, people with multiple severe disabilities caused by brain injuries, are predominantly cared for in permanent residential living facilities. In 2009 the Fürst Donnersmarck Foundation (FDSt) launched a new housing project - supported living accommodations (SLA) - for this group of people. Residents from a permanent residential living facility (Fürst Donnersmarck House, FDH) are offered the opportunity to move into 2 newly built SLA with a 24/7 individual support of a social pedagogic staffs as well as nursing care. The aim of the study is to compare the changes of residents' social and health related outcomes in the SLA group as compared to the group remaining in stationary care.In a prospective longitudinal study (2009-2011) residents of the FDH are surveyed using standardized self- and proxy-rating instruments. Times of measurement are shortly before moving into the SLA (baseline, t1) and at follow-up after 6, 12 and 18 months after relocation (t2-t4). Additionally to residents' socio-demographic data, health outcomes including ADL functioning (EBI), quality of life (WHOQoL-Bref, EQ-5D), need of assistance (HMB-W), social inclusion/perceived disability (WHODAS II), anxiety and depression (HADS) and social contacts were evaluated.40 residents could be included into the study, 29 of them moved into 2 SLA. The underlying neurological causes of the handicap were mainly sequelae of acuired damage of the central nervous system during adult age. Residents are on average 46.2 years old and predominantly male (65%). During the study the perceived dis-ability (WHODAS II) increased statistically significant but we could not show differences between groups (p > 0.05). Changes in functional and cognitive everyday abilities, fear, depression and quality of life (WHOQoL-Bref, EQ-5D) could not be shown (p > 0.05). The perceived sense of -mastery (Pearlin Mastery Scale) increased statistically significant and showed more positive developments by tendency in SLA. Everyday activities in SLA increased to a large extent.Some positive but no overall effects of moving into SLA can be shown. It is remarkable that the serious changes of living conditions do not lead to less QoL or more anxiety in this vulnerable group of people but resulted in increasing external contacts and greater mobility. Social pedagogic support offers the residents the chance to bear a more self-determined life and to participate actively in new social networks.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474000","annotations":[{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.741074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.72117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.581855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.412117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.391924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.231171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Pedagogy","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Emotional intelligence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Age of consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent"},{"name":"Public housing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing"}]}
