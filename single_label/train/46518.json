{"id":46518,"title":"Treatment of lateral pelvic nodes metastases from rectal cancer: the future prospective.","abstract":"One feature of rectal cancer that remains controversial is the significance of lateral lymph node, because TME does not remove these nodes. We discussed the brief history of lateral nodes dissection and some problems in performing the extended surgery.In Japan, an ongoing prospective multicenter randomized trial comparing TME alone and TME with clearance of lateral node is progress. In the West, MERCURY study showed 11.7% of patients with rectal cancer had MRI-identified suspicious pelvic side wall nodes. Judging from incidence and prognosis, pelvic side wall nodes in the west are almost similar meaning as lateral nodes in Japan. There is long-standing controversy as to whether lateral lymph nodes metastasis represent systemic or localized disease. Though there has been reports suggesting effect of RT on lateral nodes metastases, the question remains whether preoperative CRT can fully sterilize lateral nodes deposits. Is it appropriate inspection assuming that positive CRM and bowel perforation is major cause of local recurrence after abdominoperineal resection? Some reports say that lateral node metastasis is major cause of local recurrence.We must share following views that the east and the west should join forces to improve selection criteria for lateral node dissection and neoadjuvant treatment to prevent overtreatment, and ultimately aim to improve quality of life and oncological outcome for patients with low rectal cancer.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629807","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.902567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.856384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.629401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.316595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mercury (planet)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Inspection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Localized disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_disease"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"}]}
