{"id":10624,"title":"What we have learned from animal models of HCMV.","abstract":"Although human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) primary infection is generally asymptomatic, in immune-compromised patients HCMV increases morbidity and mortality. As a member of the betaherpesvirus family, in vivo studies of HCMV are limited due to its species specificity. CMVs from other species are often used as surrogates to express HCMV genes/proteins or used as models for inferring HCMV protein function in humans. Using innovative experiments, these animal models have answered important questions about CMV's life cycle, dissemination, pathogenesis, immune evasion, and host immune response. This chapter provides CMV biologists with an overview of the insights gained using these animal models. Subsequent chapters will provide details of the specifics of the experimental methods developed for each of the animal models discussed here.
