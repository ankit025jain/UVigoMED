{"id":43776,"title":"Considerations and conditions involving protozoal inhabitation of the reptilian gastrointestinal tract.","abstract":"In mammals, gastrointestinal protozoal organism inhabitation has been well studied, with hundreds of species defined as parasites. While the mammalian protozoal relationships have been identified and categorized by anatomy, tropism, pathogenicity, and life cycles, relatively few species of protozoal organism relationships have been categorized in reptiles. Species of parasites are still being segregated from each other, and conflicting information needs to be clarified to completely understand the data already available. This article presents the information available to help reptile practitioners make evidence-based decisions regarding both the determination of a pathologic parasitic condition and direct appropriate treatment of patients.
