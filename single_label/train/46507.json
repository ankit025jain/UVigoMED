{"id":46507,"title":"Apoptotic and anti-apoptotic seromarkers for assessment of disease severity of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.","abstract":"This study aimed to find out non-invasive markers for the assessment of severity of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in an attempt to decrease the need for liver biopsy. It also aimed to evaluate the key role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of the disease and the suggested role of anti-apoptotic factors in therapeutic modalities and disease prognosis.The serum levels of soluble Fas (s. Fas), s. Fas ligand, cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) fragment and Bcl-2 were measured in 80 patients and 15 non-hepatic subjects as control. The patients were divided based on histological examination of liver biopsy into three groups. Group I included 40 patients with NASH, group II had 40 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) non-NASH and group III had 15 non-hepatic subjects as control. Apoptosis of hepatocytes was assessed by morphological examination using a light microscope and expressed as number per square millimetre.There was a significant increase in the serum levels of s. Fas, s. Fas ligand and CK-18 fragments in the NASH group. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 showed significantly low levels in NASH patients. Apoptosis of hepatocytes was significantly higher in the NASH group. The degree of apoptosis was inversely correlated with the level of Bcl-2. A significant correlation between both s. Fas and CK-18 fragment with liver histology with regard to lobular inflammation and ballooning was found.Increased serum levels of s. Fas and CK-18 fragment in the NASH group and its correlation with the severity of disease suggested the key role of apoptosis in NASH pathogenesis which can be used for the assessment of the severity of NASH. A high level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in NAFLD suggests its protective role in disease progress.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630506","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.789319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.767923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Optical microscope","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.607899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.606934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.563644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.156946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Virus classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_classification"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
