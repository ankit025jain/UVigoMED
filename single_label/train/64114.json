{"id":64114,"title":"[Usefulness of the guidelines for prevention of perioperative anaphylaxis associated with latex allergy].","abstract":"Anaphylaxis associated with latex allergy is one of the fatal complications during anesthesia. To prevent this complication, we find out latex allergy and high-risk patients by preoperative interview and keep away not only latex allergic patients but high-risk patients from latex allergen in the operating room. In this study, we evaluated the cost-benefit efficiency of our guidelines.This is a prospective observational study for six month. We classified the patients undergoing elective operation into three categories: latex allergy (group LA), high-risk of latex allergy (group LH) and control (group C), and we compared the incidence of perioperative anaphylaxis and the cost of using products without latex allergen.A total of 1.291 patients were enrolled in the analysis. Five patients (0.4%) and 206 patients (16.0%) categorized into group LA, and LH respectively. There was no patient diagnosed with anaphylaxis associated with latex allergy during the observation period. We are able to save the cost of 3.5 million yen every year by our method than using products without latex allergen for all cases.Our guidelines for prevention of perioperative anaphylaxis associated with latex allergy might be efficient from the standpoint of cost-benefit","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255667","annotations":[{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.662441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.122673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Latex allergy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex_allergy"},{"name":"Japanese yen","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"291","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/291"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Keep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
