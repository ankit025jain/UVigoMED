{"id":81586,"title":"Current nanotechnological strategies for an effective delivery of drugs in treatment of periodontal disease.","abstract":"Periodontal disease is a localized inflammatory disorder, with tissue destruction resulting from the host response to bacterial antigens and irritants. Several other risk factors, such as smoking, hormonal changes, diabetes, drugs, disease, and genetic factors, play an important role in the progression of periodontal disease. This disease results in the formation of periodontal pockets or deepened crevices between the gingival and tooth root that produce occasional pain and discomfort, impaired mastication, and irreversible tooth loss. The primary rationale for controlled, sustained, and targeted drug delivery is necessary to achieve better therapeutic outcomes or patient compliance against periodontal disease and its various stages. Both systemic (liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, hydrogels) and local (fibers, patches, films, gels) antibiotic/antimicrobial approaches have their important place in periodontal therapy. The overall goal of this article is to provide the clinician with information related to the pathogenesis, risk, polymer used for drug delivery, and current nanotechnological systems for an effective treatment of periodontal disease.
