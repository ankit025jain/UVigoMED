{"id":8736,"title":"Unique epitopes recognized by antibodies induced in Chikungunya virus-infected non-human primates: implications for the study of immunopathology and vaccine development.","abstract":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an Alphavirus that causes chronic and incapacitating arthralgia in humans. Although patient cohort studies have shown the production of CHIKV specific antibodies, the fine specificity of the antibody response against CHIKV is not completely defined. The macaque model of CHIKV infection was established due to limitations of clinical specimens. More importantly, its close relation to humans will allow the study of chronic infection and further identify important CHIKV targets. In this study, serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques collected at different time-points post infection were used to characterize the antibody production pattern and kinetics. Results revealed that anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing and the E2 glycoprotein, Capsid, nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins were targets of the anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques. Furthermore, linear B-cell epitopes recognized by these anti-CHIKV antibodies were identified, and mapped to their structural localization. This characterizes the specificity of anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques and further demonstrates the importance of the different regions in CHIKV-encoded proteins in the adaptive immune response. Information from this study provides critical knowledge that will aid in the understanding of CHIKV infection and immunity, vaccine design, and pre-clinical efficacy studies.
