{"id":69483,"title":"Primary intratesticular pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma: a rare case report.","abstract":"Intratesticular leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare tumor of the genitourinary system. We report a case of intratesticular pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma in a 68-year-old male who presented with gradual painless enlargement of the right scrotal mass over a period of 1-2 years. Radiological examination revealed a right testicular tumor.Right radical orchiectomy was performed with high ligation of the spermatic cord. Histopathological examination along with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of a pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma of the testis. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the 13 th case of primary intratesticular leiomyosarcoma and the third case of high-grade (pleomorphic) intratesticular leiomyosarcoma in an elderly male reported in the literature.
