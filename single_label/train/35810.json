{"id":35810,"title":"Liver transplantation in defects of cholesterol biosynthesis: the case of lathosterolosis.","abstract":"We report the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) in the only surviving patient with lathosterolosis, a defect of cholesterol biosynthesis characterized by high lathosterol levels associated with progressive cholestasis, multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation. From her diagnosis at age 2 she had shown autistic behavior, was unable to walk unaided and her sight was impaired by cataracts. By age 7 she developed end-stage liver disease. After a soul-searching discussion within the transplantation team, she was treated with LT as this represented her only lifesaving option. At 1-year follow-up, her lathosterol levels had returned to normal (0.61 mg/dL from 13.04 Â± 2.65) and her nutrition improved. She began exploring her environment and walking by holding onto an adult's hand and then independently. Her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had shown a normal picture at age 1, whereas a volume reduction of white matter with ex vacuo ventricular dilatation and defective myelinization were observed before transplant. At 5-year follow-up, a complete biochemical recovery, an arrest of mental deterioration and a stable MRI picture were achieved, with a return to her every day life albeit with limitations. Timely liver transplant in defects of cholesterol biosynthesis might arrest the progression of neurological damage.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621408","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.746293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.688474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.566255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.551766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.492744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.289583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.286373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.116011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0659939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
