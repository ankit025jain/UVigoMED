{"id":46294,"title":"Clinical significance of colonoscopy in patients with upper gastrointestinal polyps and neoplasms: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Some authors have studied the relationship between the presence of polyps, adenomas and cancers of upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach and duodenum) and risk of colorectal polyps and neoplasms; however, the results are controversial, which may be due to study sample size, populations, design, clinical features, and so on. No meta-analysis, which can be generalized to a larger population and could provide a quantitative pooled risk estimate of the relationship, of this issue existed so far.We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate risk of colorectal polyps or neoplasms in patients with polyps, adenomas or cancers in upper gastrointestinal tract comparing with controls. A search was conducted through PubMed, EMBASE, reference lists of potentially relevant papers, and practice guidelines up to 27 November 2013 without languages restriction. Odd ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models.The search yielded 3 prospective and 21 retrospective case-control studies (n?=?37152 participants). The principal findings included: (1) OR for colorectal polyps was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.04-1.26) in the gastric polyps group comparing with control groups; (2) Patients with gastric polyps and neoplasms have higher risk (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.06-1.62], and 1.72 [95% CI, 1.42-2.09], respectively) of colorectal neoplasms comparing with their controls; and (3) Positive association was found between the presence of colorectal neoplasms and sporadic duodenal neoplasms (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.64-4.11).Findings from present meta-analysis of 24 case-control studies suggest that the prevalence of colorectal polyps was higher in patients with gastric polyps than in those without gastric polyps, and the risk of colorectal neoplasms increases significantly in patients with gastric polyps, neoplasms, and duodenal neoplasms. Therefore, screening colonoscopy should be considered for patients with upper gastrointestinal polyps and neoplasms.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637723","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.869772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.827617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Small intestine cancer","weight":0.800488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine_cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.746486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.720725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.685203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.665592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
