{"id":90482,"title":"Plantar loading during jumping while wearing a rigid carbon graphite footplate.","abstract":"Fifth metatarsal stress fractures are common in sports and often result in delayed and non-union. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a rigid carbon graphite footplate (CGF) on plantar loading during take-off and landing from a jump. Nineteen recreational male athletes with no history of lower extremity injury in the past 6 months and no foot or ankle surgery in the past 3 years participated in this study. Subjects completed 7 jumping tasks while wearing a standard running shoe and then the shoe plus the CGF while plantar loading data was recorded. A series of paired t-tests were used to examine differences between the two footwear conditions independently for both takeoff and landing (a = 0.05). The contact area in the medial midfoot (p < .001) and forefoot (p = .010) statistically decreased when wearing the CGFP. The force–time integral was significantly greater when wearing the CGFP in the middle (p < .001) and lateral forefoot (p = .019). Maximum force was significantly greater beneath the middle (p < .001) and lateral forefoot (p < .001) when wearing the CGFP, while it was decreased beneath the medial midfoot (p < .001). During landing, the contact area beneath the medial (p = .017) and lateral midfoot (p = .004) were significantly decreased when wearing the CGFP. The force– time integral was significantly decrease beneath the medial midfoot (p < .001) when wearing the CGFP. The maximum force was significantly greater beneath the medial (p = .047) and middle forefoot (p = .001) when the subject was wearing the CGFP. The maximum force beneath the medial midfoot (p < .001) was significantly reduced when wearing the carbon graphite footplate. The results of the study indicate that the CGF is ineffective at reducing plantar loading during jumping and landing.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611163","annotations":[{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.639889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.59391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.551766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.50565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Graphite","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Stress fracture","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_fracture"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Shoe","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe"},{"name":"Jumping","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Footwear","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Athletic shoe","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_shoe"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Commonwealth Games","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games"},{"name":"Takeoff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff"},{"name":"Angling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angling"},{"name":"Landing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Footplate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footplate"},{"name":"Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._5_(Beethoven)"},{"name":"Uncial 047","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_047"}]}
