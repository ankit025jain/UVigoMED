{"id":89321,"title":"Anatomy and physiology of perforator flaps of the upper limb.","abstract":"Perforator flaps are an excellent reconstructive option for a functional upper limb reconstruction. This article explores the physiology and general principles of perforator flaps and their indications for use in reconstruction of the upper extremity. Workhorse perforator flaps of the upper extremity, such as the radial artery perforator, ulnar artery perforator, lateral arm perforator, posterior interosseous artery, first dorsal metacarpal artery perforator and perforator-based propeller flaps, are discussed in greater detail.
