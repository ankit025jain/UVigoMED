{"id":91377,"title":"Locking knee after intra-articular migration of broken patella tension band wire: an extraordinary intra-articular migration via pseudarthrosis line.","abstract":"Fixation of displaced patella fractures with tension band wiring is a commonly performed technique. Broken metal wires after such surgeries are not uncommon, however, intra-articular wire migration after failure of the tension band wires in the patella is uncommon and rarely described. In this study, we report a case of locking knee symptoms secondary to the migration of a broken patella wire into the knee joint through the pseudarthrosis line.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509227","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.533609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.52602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.212553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.105661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Joint lock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_lock"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
