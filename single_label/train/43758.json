{"id":43758,"title":"Genome-wide association study identifies variants associated with autoimmune hepatitis type 1.","abstract":"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an uncommon autoimmune liver disease of unknown etiology. We used a genome-wide approach to identify genetic variants that predispose individuals to AIH.We performed a genome-wide association study of 649 adults in The Netherlands with AIH type 1 and 13,436 controls. Initial associations were further analyzed in an independent replication panel comprising 451 patients with AIH type 1 in Germany and 4103 controls. We also performed an association analysis in the discovery cohort using imputed genotypes of the major histocompatibility complex region.We associated AIH with a variant in the major histocompatibility complex region at rs2187668 (P = 1.5 × 10(-78)). Analysis of this variant in the discovery cohort identified HLA-DRB1*0301 (P = 5.3 × 10(-49)) as a primary susceptibility genotype and HLA-DRB1*0401 (P = 2.8 × 10(-18)) as a secondary susceptibility genotype. We also associated AIH with variants of SH2B3 (rs3184504, 12q24; P = 7.7 × 10(-8)) and CARD10 (rs6000782, 22q13.1; P = 3.0 × 10(-6)). In addition, strong inflation of association signal was found with single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with other immune-mediated diseases, including primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, but not with single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with other genetic traits.In a genome-wide association study, we associated AIH type 1 with variants in the major histocompatibility complex region, and identified variants of SH2B3and CARD10 as likely risk factors. These findings support a complex genetic basis for AIH pathogenesis and indicate that part of the genetic susceptibility overlaps with that for other immune-mediated liver diseases.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768677","annotations":[{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Primary sclerosing cholangitis","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.739852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.728924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.583118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Primary biliary cirrhosis","weight":0.51563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_biliary_cirrhosis"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.48849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.420735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.266257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.140999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.131728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Inflation","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation"}]}
