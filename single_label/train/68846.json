{"id":68846,"title":"[Management of enzalutamide, a new hormonal therapy].","abstract":"Enzalutamide (MDV3100) is a non-steroidal antiandrogen of second generation that has shown efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The study AFFIRM demonstrated a statistically significant increase in overall survival among patients who have progressed following a docetaxel chemotherapy. Based on these results, a marketing authorization for enzalutamide has been granted. The enzalutamide has been shown to be generally well tolerated. Other trials are underway to evaluate its earlier use in the management of mCRPC. A pivotal registration phase III study (PREVAIL) is ongoing to investigate the effectiveness of enzalutamide in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy.
