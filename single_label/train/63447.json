{"id":63447,"title":"Chromosome 7q31.1 deletion in myeloid neoplasms.","abstract":"We studied monosomy and deletions of chromosome 7 in 208 patients with myeloid disorders; we found 39 patients (19%) with monosomy or deletion of chromosome 7: 24 patients with chromosome 7 deletion and 15 with monosomy 7. In the 24 patients with chromosome 7 deletions, studied with copy-number variants, short-tandem repeats, microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and deletion polymorphisms, the most common deleted region was 7q31.1 (20 patients). Deletion polymorphism studies performed in these 20 patients showed an interstitial deletion of at least 140 kilobase in 6 patients; the deletion spans between the genes forkhead box P2 and Myo D family inhibitor domain containing. Because both genes do not seem to be involved in leukogenesis, we suggest to look carefully into this deletion for the presence of tumor suppressor genes and microRNAs.
