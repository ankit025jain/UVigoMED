{"id":72735,"title":"Survivin suppression through STAT3/?-catenin is essential  for resveratrol-induced melanoma apoptosis.","abstract":"Although many chemotherapies have been developed for melanomas, successful therapy would be aided by the identification of intrinsic mechanisms that are crucial for melanoma survival. Here, we used resveratrol, a phytoalexin, as an anti-melanoma reagent. Applying resveratrol to various human and murine melanoma cell lines, we show that survivin is essential for melanoma survival in vitro and in vivo and is targeted by resveratrol. Furthermore, we identify the down regulation of survivin transcription by resveratrol through the suppression of ?-catenin and STAT3. In addition, over expression of survivin protects melanoma cells from resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these studies establish that targeting survivin could provide an opportunity to treat melanoma patients.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946930","annotations":[{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Phytoalexin","weight":0.610321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoalexin"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.482375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.473576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Survivin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivin"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"}]}
