{"id":85601,"title":"A public health emergency preparedness critical incident registry.","abstract":"Health departments use after-action reports to collect data on their experience in responding to actual public health emergencies. To address deficiencies in the use of such reports revealed in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and to develop an effective approach to learning from actual public health emergencies, we sought to understand how the concept and operations of a \"critical incident registry,\" commonly used in other industries, could be adapted for public health emergency preparedness. We conducted a workshop with public health researchers and practitioners, reviewed the literature on learning from rare events, and sought to identify the optimal characteristics of a critical incident registry (CIR) for public health emergency preparedness. Several key critical characteristics are needed for a CIR to be feasible and useful. A registry should: (1) include incidents in the response in which public health agencies played a substantial role, are \"meaningful,\" test one or more emergency preparedness capabilities, and are sufficiently limited in scope to isolate specific response issues; (2) be supported by a framework and standard protocols for including reports based on rigorous analysis of individual incidents and methods for cross-case analysis; and (3) include explicit incentives for reporting, to overcome intrinsic disincentives. With proper incentives in place, a critical incident registry can be a useful tool for improving public health emergency preparedness. Standard protocols for reporting critical events and probing analysis are needed to enable identification of patterns of successes and failures.
