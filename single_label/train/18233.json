{"id":18233,"title":"Neonatal necrotising fasciitis managed conservatively: an experience from a tertiary centre.","abstract":"Conventional therapy for neonatal necrotising fasciitis (NF) involves resuscitation and aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. This approach adds surgical stress in septicaemic neonates with low reserves. The present study reports a more conservative approach to the management of neonatal NF.A prospective study was conducted between July 2010 and June 2013 and included 11 cases of neonatal NF. Demographic characteristics of patients were noted. No debridement was performed. Dressings were applied after cleaning with normal saline every 24 hours. The necrotic slough was allowed to separate spontaneously. A record was made of type and duration of supportive modalities and complications. The primary outcome was recorded as final recovery, need of surgical intervention or need of grafting.Out of 11 neonates, 6 were males and 5 were females. Age ranged from 13 to 24 days (mean age 18.45±3.24 days), and weight varied from 1.8 to 2.6 kg (mean weight 2.12±0.24kg) at presentation. Duration of illness before admission to hospital ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean 4.84±2.13 days). The most common site of the initial involvement was the neck and upper thoracic region (n=4), scalp (n=3), lower back (n=2), face (n=1) and extremities (n=1). In all cases, the wound was cleaned with normal saline, dressed, necrotic slough was allowed to separate spontaneously and granulation tissue was allowed to develop; this took approximately 14 to 28 days (mean 20.45±5.78 days).As opposed to the conventional approach of aggressive debridement in neonatal NF, these cases can be managed conservatively without increase in morbidity or mortality. This approach also minimises the surgical risk and requirement of blood transfusion. Antifungal drugs have a definitive role in management of these immunologically deficient babies.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
