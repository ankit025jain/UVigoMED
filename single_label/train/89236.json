{"id":89236,"title":"From battleside to stateside: the reconstructive journey of our wounded warriors.","abstract":"Recent military operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) have led to further refinements of the military medical system's ability to provide advanced surgical care. The deployment of a global trauma care system has directly contributed to improved combat casualty survival rates. As a consequence of improved survivorship, a high-volume patient population of individuals having challenging multiple extremity injuries/amputations has presented to military treatment facilities. These patients present with unique mixed pattern blast injuries. Blast injuries incorporate multiple mechanisms of injury including penetrating fragmentary injury, blunt force trauma, flash burn, and overpressure wave damage. These complex injuries have furthered refinements in traditional reconstruction and facilitated early application of regenerative medicine therapies. This article summarizes information presented at the inaugural Garry Brody, MD Family Invited Lectureship presented at the 63rd California Society of Plastic Surgeons Annual.
