{"id":17849,"title":"Childhood stroke: results of 130 children from a reference center in Central Anatolia, Turkey.","abstract":"Although stroke among children is rare, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality. We aim to share our experience of children with arterial ischemic stroke.The initial symptoms, demographical features, risk factors, neurological examination, neuroradiological findings, and clinical follow-up data of 130 Turkish children seen between 2002 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed.Sixty-eight patients were male. Thirty of the children were aged from 1 to 12 months (seven of them died in this period). Focal neurological signs were the most common presentation, and hemiplegia or hemiparesis were the most common focal signs. Underlying risk factors were detected in 103 patients. Infections and congenital heart disease were the most common risk factors. Seven of the nine children with recurrent arterial ischemic strokes had one or more underlying diseases (moyamoya disease in two children along with factor V Leiden mutation, tuberculous meningitis, congenital heart disease, homocystinuria, and hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome). The arterial ischemic stroke was located in the middle cerebral circulation in 68 (36 left and 32 right) and in the posterior cerebral artery in 41. Eighteen children died. The neurological outcome was assessed in 98 children. Of these children, 66 children have neurological deficits and 52 children have seizures. Stroke in the first year of life is more often fatal. Recurrent stroke is associated with poor prognosis.Tuberculous meningitis is still a risk factor for arterial ischemic stroke in Turkey. Arterial ischemic stroke in the first year of life and recurrent arterial ischemic stroke represent poor prognostic features.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
