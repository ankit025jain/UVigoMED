{"id":82213,"title":"Biomechanics and peri-implantitis: The effect of a subcrestal wing-thread to decrease alveolar crestal bone strain. theory, finite element analysis, and clinical application.","abstract":"This study used finite element analysis and a clinical case example to test the hypothesis that a wing-thread placed 4 mm below the top of an implant would decrease crestal bone loss in function.Finite element analysis was used to compare standard and wing-thread implants subjected to axial and off-axis forces based on the hypothesis that decreasing bone strain at the alveolar crestal margin improves peri-implant bone stability. A clinical case example of the wing-thread implant was followed for 30 months.Stress concentration was diminished at the crest when a wing-thread was used compared to a standard implant body. Ninety-degree lateral forces were diminished by a factor of 10 in the wing-thread implant. A patient followed for 30 months showed stable bone levels around the wing-thread implants.The wing-thread hypothesis appears to have some support for increasing bone stability based on finite element analysis and early clinical results.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683590","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.612781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.545358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.492241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stress concentration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_concentration"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Crest (heraldry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Strain (materials science)","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(materials_science)"},{"name":"Finite set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
