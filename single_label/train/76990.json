{"id":76990,"title":"Complications of adjustable gastric banding surgery for obesity.","abstract":"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedures have a favorable risk-benefit profile and are increasingly important as part of the overall management of obesity. These procedures are effective at inducing weight loss and improving comorbid conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and sleep apnea. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has several typical complications, and family physicians should recognize these as part of a team-based approach to the management of obesity. Gastric band slippage, port or tubing malfunction, stomal obstruction, band erosion, pouch dilation, and port infection are examples of complications that may occur after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Upper gastrointestinal tract imaging is often required to diagnose these complications. Some complications can be managed in the primary care setting through behavioral diet modification or removal of fluid from the band (band deflation); however, other complications require surgical repair or removal of the band.
