{"id":44402,"title":"Ectopic expression of micro-RNA-1, 21 and 125a in peripheral blood immune cells is associated with chronic HBV infection.","abstract":"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in regulating genes of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of miR-1, 21 and 125a in the immune cells taken from the peripheral blood of patients suffering from chronic HBV infection (CHB). This cross-sectional study was performed on 60 CHB patients and 60 healthy controls and expression of miR-1, 21 and 125a was evaluated using quantitative Real-Time PCR. The results showed that expression of miR-1, 21 and 125a was significantly increased in CHB patients in comparison to healthy controls. Based on our results it may be concluded that increased expression of miR-1, 21 and 125a is significantly associated with CHB and may play key roles in the induction of impaired immune responses in CHB patients.
