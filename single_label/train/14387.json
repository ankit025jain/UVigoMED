{"id":14387,"title":"Therapeutic effect of Broussonetia papyrifera and Lonicera japonica in ovalbumin-induced murine asthma model.","abstract":"Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) Vent. and Lonicera japonica Thunb. have been used in recent medicinal research for their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of B. papyrifera and L. japonica ethanolic extracts in a murine model of ovalbumin-induced asthma, in which intra-peritoneal (IP) injections and aerosol ovalbumin delivery were used to induce allergic asthma. Bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), serum samples, lungs and livers were collected from the experimental groups. In the groups treated with B. papyrifera and L. japonica extracts, CD3, CD4, serum IgE and IL-4 levels; activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9; and eotaxin levels in the BALF significantly decreased to near normal levels. Results of a histopathological analysis showed that the level of inflammation and mucous secretions reduced in the treated groups compared to the corresponding levels in the other groups. Moreover, results of a serum enzymatic analysis showed the non-toxic nature of the extracts in the B. papyrifera and L. japonica treated groups. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the B. papyrifera and L. japonica extracts may be very effective against asthma and inflammation related diseases.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24427953","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.840988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.762811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.707899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.482445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.364652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.197488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.138135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"}]}
