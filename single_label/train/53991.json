{"id":53991,"title":"Autonomous and continuous adaptation of a bihormonal bionic pancreas in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"A challenge for automated glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the large variation in insulin needs between individuals and within individuals at different times in their lives.The objectives of the study was to test the ability of a third-generation bihormonal bionic pancreas algorithm, initialized with only subject weight; to adapt automatically to the different insulin needs of adults and adolescents; and to evaluate the impact of optional, automatically adaptive meal-priming boluses.This was a randomized controlled trial.The study was conducted at an inpatient clinical research center.Twelve adults and 12 adolescents with T1D participated in the study.Subjects in each age group were randomized to automated glycemic control for 48 hours with or without automatically adaptive meal-priming boluses.Mean plasma glucose (PG), time with PG less than 60 mg/dL, and insulin total daily dose were measured.The 48-hour mean PG values with and without adaptive meal-priming boluses were 132 ± 9 vs 146 ± 9 mg/dL (P = .03) in adults and 162 ± 6 vs 175 ± 9 mg/dL (P = .01) in adolescents. Adaptive meal-priming boluses improved mean PG without increasing time spent with PG less than 60 mg/dL: 1.4% vs 2.3% (P = .6) in adults and 0.1% vs 0.1% (P = 1.0) in adolescents. Large increases in adaptive meal-priming boluses and shifts in the timing and size of automatic insulin doses occurred in adolescents. Much less adaptation occurred in adults. There was nearly a 4-fold variation in the total daily insulin dose across all cohorts (0.36-1.41 U/kg · d).A single control algorithm, initialized only with subject weight, can quickly adapt to regulate glycemia in patients with TID and highly variable insulin requirements.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System
