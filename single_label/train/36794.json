{"id":36794,"title":"Detrimental effects of UV-B radiation in a xeroderma pigmentosum-variant cell line.","abstract":"DNA polymerase ? (pol ?), of the Y-family, is well known for its in vitro DNA lesion bypass ability. The most well-characterized lesion bypassed by this polymerase is the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. Historically, cellular and whole-animal models for this area of research have been conducted using UV-C (?=100-280 nm) owing to its ability to generate large quantities of CPDs and also the more structurally distorting 6-4 photoproduct. Although UV-C is useful as a laboratory tool, exposure to these wavelengths is generally very low owing to being filtered by stratospheric ozone. We are interested in the more environmentally relevant wavelength range of UV-B (?=280-315 nm) for its role in causing cytotoxicity and mutagenesis. We evaluated these endpoints in both a normal human fibroblast control line and a Xeroderma pigmentosum variant cell line in which the POLH gene contains a truncating point mutation, leading to a nonfunctional polymerase. We demonstrate that UV-B has similar but less striking effects compared to UV-C in both its cytotoxic and its mutagenic effects. Analysis of the mutation spectra after a single dose of UV-B shows that a majority of mutations can be attributed to mutagenic bypass of dipyrimidine sequences. However, we do note additional types of mutations with UV-B that are not previously reported after UV-C exposure. We speculate that these differences are attributed to a change in the spectra of photoproduct lesions rather than other lesions caused by oxidative stress.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
