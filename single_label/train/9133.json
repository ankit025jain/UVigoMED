{"id":9133,"title":"Effects of prenatal propofol exposure on postnatal development in rats.","abstract":"Preclinical studies suggest that propofol may cause damage to immature neurons. However, the effect of maternal propofol exposure on the neuronal development of the offspring is largely unknown. In this study, pregnant rats were assigned to receive continuous infusion of saline (control) or propofol for 1 h (1HP) or 2 h (2HP) on gestational day 18. An additional group (lipid) was assigned to receive continuous infusion of intralipid fat emulsion (vehicle of propofol) for 2 h. Pups were then tested on the appearance and progression of sensory and physical motor abilities between postnatal day 1 (P1) and P28. The brain and body weights of pups from 2HP group on P10 were significantly lower than those from the saline control group, although they were the same in all four groups at birth (P0). Pups from 1HP and 2HP groups, but not lipid group, showed slower maturation of eyes (delayed opening) and several neurological reflexes (hindlimb reflex, righting reflex); they also showed delayed improvement in execution on gait reflex and inclined board tests. The forelimb reflex and negative geotaxis were also delayed in 2HP group. All parameters examined except body weight of 2HP pups recovered to normal levels by P28. We conclude that administration of propofol to pregnant rats leads to retardation in physical and neurological reflex development in their offspring.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726880","annotations":[{"name":"Fat","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.75749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.705804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.34426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.328276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.161753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Taxis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.105451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Motor skill","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Weight training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trendelenburg position","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trendelenburg_position"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
