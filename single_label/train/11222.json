{"id":11222,"title":"Component analysis of Pu-erh and its anti-constipation effects.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Pu-erh tea on activated carbon-induced constipation in ICR mice. The changes in body weight, dietary intake, gastrointestinal transit, first black stool defecation time, number and weight of feces, water content of feces and various levels of substances in serum were used to evaluate the anti-constipation effects of Pu-erh tea. Body weight, dietary intake and the amount of water consumed by mice decreased with activated carbon-induced constipation and those of the sample treated group mice were higher than the control group mice. The first black stool time of normal, control, bisacodyl (100 mg/kg) and 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg Pu-erh tea treated mice were 90, 221, 118, 178, 155 and 139 min, respectively. Following oral administration of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of Pu-erh tea and 100 mg/kg of bisacodyl, the gastrointestinal transit rates were shortened by 48.6, 59.6, 78.0 and 91.9%, respectively. Serum levels of motilin (MTL), gastrin (Gas), endothelin (ET), acetylcholine enzyme (AchE), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were significantly increased and somatostatin (SS) was decreased when the mice were treated with different concentrations of Pu-erh tea compared with the untreated control mice. These results demonstrate that Pu-erh tea has a similar preventive effect to bisacodyl and it may be used as a functional food to prevent constipation.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Animal
