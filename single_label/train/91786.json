{"id":91786,"title":"Radiographic findings of femoroacetabular impingement in capoeira players.","abstract":"Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that requires extreme movements of the hip to perform jumps and kicks. This study evaluated a group of capoeira players to assess the prevalence of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in athletes practicing this martial art.Twenty-four experienced capoeira players (14 men, 10 women) underwent a diagnostic assessment, including clinical examination and standard radiographs of the pelvis and hips. The ?-angle, head-neck offset, crossover sign, acetabular index, lateral centre-edge angle, and the Tönnis grade were assessed using the radiographs. Clinical relationships for any radiographic abnormalities indicating FAI were also evaluated.Four subjects (17 %) reported pain in their hips. Forty-four hips (91.7 %) had at least one radiographic sign of CAM impingement, and 22 (45.8 %) had an ?-angle of more than 60°. Eighteen hips (37.5 %) had at least one sign of pincer impingement and 16 (33.3 %) a positive crossover sign. Sixteen hips (33.3 %) had mixed impingement. There was a significant positive association between having an ?-angle of more than 60° and the presence of groin pain (P = 0.002). A reduced femoral head-neck offset (P < 0.001) and an increased ?-angle on the anteroposterior radiograph (P = 0.008) were independently associated with a higher Tönnis grade.High prevalence of radiographic CAM-type FAI among these skilled capoeira players was found. In these subjects, a negative clinical correlation for an increased ?-angle was also detected. Additional caution should be exercised whenever subjects with past or present hip pain engage in capoeira.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474582","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.716206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.700877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.385609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Martial arts","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.161714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Femoral acetabular impingement","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_acetabular_impingement"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Capoeira","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Football Association of Ireland","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"}]}
