{"id":89819,"title":"Ensuring correct placement of proximal fixation in reconstruction intramedullary nailing for subtrochanteric femur fractures.","abstract":"Subtrochanteric femur fractures present a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. Anatomic reduction and stabilization can be technically difficult. A variety of intramedullary and extramedullary devices have been used to stabilize these fractures. The authors describe a novel technique for easier proximal interlock fixation for reconstruction intramedullary nailing to ensure proper placement into the nail. This will likely save time in a patient population that may be either frail and elderly or young with high-energy polytrauma, and it may reduce radiation exposure for both patients and surgeons.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679192","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.354278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.229485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.227953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.184596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Interlock (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlock_(engineering)"},{"name":"ABC (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"}]}
