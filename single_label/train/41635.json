{"id":41635,"title":"TH9 cells that express the transcription factor PU.1 drive T cell-mediated colitis via IL-9 receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells.","abstract":"The molecular checkpoints that drive inflammatory bowel diseases are incompletely understood. Here we found more T cells expressing the transcription factor PU.1 and interleukin 9 (IL-9) in patients with ulcerative colitis. In an animal model, citrine reporter mice had more IL-9-expressing mucosal T cells in experimental oxazolone-induced colitis. IL-9 deficiency suppressed acute and chronic colitis. Mice with PU.1 deficiency in T cells were protected from colitis, whereas treatment with antibody to IL-9 suppressed colitis. Functionally, IL-9 impaired intestinal barrier function and prevented mucosal wound healing in vivo. Thus, our findings suggest that the TH9 subset of helper T cells serves an important role in driving ulcerative colitis by regulating intestinal epithelial cells and that TH9 cells represent a likely target for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908389","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.648117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.619436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.514693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.344178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.312037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Interleukin 9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_9"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Polyurethane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Leaky gut","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut"}]}
