{"id":53124,"title":"Efficacy assessment of newly developed open-window intervention needles for the treatment of cystic thyroid nodules that cannot be aspirated.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to develop a novel open-window needle aspiration method and evaluate its efficacy in drainage and sclerotherapy of cystic thyroid nodules that cannot be aspirated with an 18-gauge needle.Two rectangular windows 5.0?mm in length and 1.0?mm wide were placed at the end of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCA) needle trocar to develop a new open-window intervention needle. The efficiency of the open-window intervention needle was compared either to a porous interventional needle or to an ordinary PTCA needle by assessing the aspiration efficiency. The efficacy of the modified open-window approach was tested by carrying out sclerotherapy and drainage on 21 thyroid cystic nodules that could not be aspirated with an 18-gauge needle and comparing it to aspiration with an 18-gauge PTCA needle of 50 cystic thyroid nodules.The efficacy of aspirating coupling agents of various specifications using the new open-window intervention was superior to aspiration using the PTCA trocar needle or a porous needle (p<0.05). Ethanol ablation efficacy in the treatment of 21 cystic thyroid nodules that could not be aspirated with an 18-gauge needle and the aspiration efficacy of 50 cystic thyroid nodules with an 18-gauge PTCA needle were not significantly different (p>0.05).The new open-window intervention needle approach was highly effective in conducting ethanol ablation of cystic thyroid nodules that could not be aspirated using conventional methodologies.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24547900","annotations":[{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.779278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.444238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.412353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.189319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Trocar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocar"},{"name":"Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_transhepatic_cholangiography"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Aspirated consonant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Rectangle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Ordinary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cholangiography","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"}]}
