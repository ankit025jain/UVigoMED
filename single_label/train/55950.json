{"id":55950,"title":"Transconjunctival epiblepharon repair.","abstract":"To document the use of a transconjunctival approach to lower eyelid epiblepharon repair.Retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent transconjunctival lower eyelid epiblepharon repair.Nine patients underwent repair via this approach. All patients experienced the resolution of their keratitis and cilia-cornea touch by a 3-month postoperative interval, and no patient developed a postoperative complication. Furthermore, no patient developed cutaneous scarring.Conventional approaches to lower eyelid epiblepharon repair have necessitated the creation of a skin and muscle flap, thus risking the development of scarring and a cosmetically unacceptable eyelid crease. This report documents the use of a transconjunctival approach for the management of this condition that avoids external incisions and provides excellent outcomes without scarring of the anterior lamella of the eyelid.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777274","annotations":[{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Crease (cricket)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"}]}
