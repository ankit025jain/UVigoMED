{"id":23972,"title":"Childhood pneumonia in developing countries.","abstract":"Pneumonia is a widespread and common infectious lung disease that causes inflammation, which can lead to reduced oxygenation, shortness of breath, and death. An estimated nearly 1.2 million children younger than 5 years died in 2011 from pneumonia. Most of these deaths occured in developing countries where access to care is limited and interventions that have improved care in developed countries are scarce. Despite substantial increases in our understanding of the clinical syndrome of pneumonia and its aetiologies, its accurate diagnosis is challenging when clinical indicators are relied on, and improves only modestly with addition of laboratory, microbiological, or radiographical tests. Prevention programmes and treatment guidelines have led to impressive reductions in disease, but children remain at risk of misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. Research to address challenges in the aetiological diagnosis of pneumonia and widespread implementation of treatment interventions beyond vaccines and antibiotics are necessary to mitigate the burden of pneumonia and improve child survival.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461618","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.720592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.547295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.518285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.484048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_Guidelines_from_The_Medical_Letter"},{"name":"Child survival","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_survival"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
