{"id":44142,"title":"Therapeutic outcomes of endoscopic resection for superficial non-ampullary duodenal tumor.","abstract":"Endoscopic resection (ER) is widely used as a minimally invasive therapy to remove superficial non-ampullary duodenal tumor (SNADT). However, the indication criteria have not yet been clearly determined. At our institute, ER is done only for SNADT measuring ? 20 mm. We report our findings on the therapeutic outcomes of ER of SNADT.We carried out ER in 47 patients with SNADT. Indication criteria for ER included a lesion suspected as high-grade dysplasia or mucosal cancer and measuring ? 20 mm. The ER methods used to carry out en bloc resection were endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR: 17 lesions) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD: 30 lesions). We then analyzed the therapeutic outcomes between them.There were no significant differences between the EMR and ESD groups with regard to age, sex, location of the lesion, and histology. The most frequent gross types resected by EMR and ESD were 0-IIa and 0-IIc, respectively (P=0.004). Median procedure time was significantly longer in ESD than in EMR, 79.5 and 9 min, respectively (P<0.001). R0 resection was achieved in 10 cases by EMR (59%) and in 27 cases by ESD (90%) (P=0.017). No complications occurred in cases that underwent EMR, but immediate and delayed perforations occurred in three patients who underwent ESD, although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.467).Using our indication criteria, which limited lesion size to ? 20 mm, satisfactory therapeutic outcomes of ER of SNADT were obtained.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750149","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.64757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.284157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.255123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.169228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.149621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Electrostatic discharge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge"},{"name":"Apple IIc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIc"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Monobloc engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Institute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
