{"id":23534,"title":"[Successful home-made fecal transplant for an elderly woman].","abstract":"Recurrent clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a challenge for infectious disease specialists. A third of first recurrences will fail antibiotic therapy. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this, such as persistence of spores, inadequate antibody response, and altered gut microbiota. Standard recommendations for CDI treatment include metronidazole and vancomycin. Fecal transplant has proven to be an effective therapy for recurrent CDI. Infusion of stools can be administered to the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract during an endoscopic procedure or using nasogastric/duodenal or rectal tubes. Elderly persons have an increased incidence of recurrent infection and have a higher mortality rate. We propose a home-based delivery method using a 5 ml syringe for intrarectal infusion of stools.
