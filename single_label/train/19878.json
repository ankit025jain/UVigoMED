{"id":19878,"title":"Single-stage revision for fungal peri-prosthetic joint infection: a single-centre experience.","abstract":"Fungal peri-prosthetic infections of the knee and hip are rare but likely to result in devastating complications. In this study we evaluated the results of their management using a single-stage exchange technique. Between 2001 and 2011, 14 patients (ten hips, four knees) were treated for a peri-prosthetic fungal infection. One patient was excluded because revision surgery was not possible owing to a large acetabular defect. One patient developed a further infection two months post-operatively and was excluded from the analysis. Two patients died of unrelated causes. After a mean of seven years (3 to 11) a total of ten patients were available for follow-up. One patient, undergoing revision replacement of the hip, had a post-operative dislocation. Another patient, undergoing revision replacement of the knee, developed a wound infection and required revision 29 months post-operatively following a peri-prosthetic femoral fracture. The mean Harris hip score increased to 74 points (63 to 84; p < 0.02) in those undergoing revision replacement of the hip, and the mean Hospital for Special Surgery knee score increased to 75 points (70 to 80; p < 0.01) in those undergoing revision replacement of the knee. A single-stage revision following fungal peri-prosthetic infection is feasible, with an acceptable rate of a satisfactory outcome.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692616","annotations":[{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.57098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.523766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.505365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.484707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hospital for Special Surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_for_Special_Surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
