{"id":31286,"title":"First case report of vanadium metallosis after ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty.","abstract":"The development of metallosis as a complication following rupture of a hip replacement is known to occur as a result of contact with metal components of the prosthesis (1).In such cases, high cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) levels in the blood have been reported by several Authors (2).Recently, it has been stressed that the clinical investigation should focus on general reactions to high circulating metal levels, such as toxicity for the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system (3).Despite the increasing interest of literature in ceramic-on-ceramic hip arthroplasty (4),little is known about these complications, and in particular of metallosis. To our knowledge this is the first description of a condition of extensive metallosis and radiographic signs presenting as a result of wear of a ceramic-on-ceramic prosthesis.
