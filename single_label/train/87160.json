{"id":87160,"title":"Factors associated with acceptability of HIV self-testing among health care workers in Kenya.","abstract":"Health care workers (HCWs) in sub-Saharan Africa are at a high risk of HIV infection from both sexual and occupational exposures. However, many do not seek HIV testing. This paper examines the acceptability of an unsupervised facility-based HIV self-testing (HIVST) intervention among HCWs and their partners and factors associated with uptake of HIVST among HCWs. HCWs in seven large Kenyan hospitals were invited to participate in pre-HIVST information sessions during which they were offered HIVST kits to take home for self-testing. A post-intervention survey was conducted among 765 HCWs. Forty-one percent attended the information session; of those, 89% took the HIVST kits and of those, 85% self-tested. Thirty-four percent of surveyed HCWs used the HIVST to test themselves. Of those who took the HIVST kit and had partners, 73% gave the kit to their partner and 86% of them indicated their partner self-tested. Factors positively associated with use of the HIVST on self were being female, being single, and being a HCW from Homa Bay Hospital (located in a high HIV prevalence area). HIVST is acceptable to HCWs and their partners. However, strategies are needed to increase HCWs attendance at pre-implementation information sessions.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974123","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.817704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.588761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.409345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.223504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Homa Bay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homa_Bay"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0269276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Drum kit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_HIV/AIDS_adult_prevalence_rate"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0153745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Child care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care"},{"name":"Public legal education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_legal_education"}]}
