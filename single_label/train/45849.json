{"id":45849,"title":"The socio-economic impact of chronic pancreatitis: a systematic review.","abstract":"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory disorder with pain being the most frequent symptom. It is associated with loss of function, pancreatogenic diabetes and digestive enzyme deficiency. The impact of local complications and loss of pancreatic function results in unknown and unreported costs. This study attempts to identify both the direct and indirect costs associated with CP.A MEDLINE literature review was performed for all relevant articles relating to any aspect of direct and indirect costs as a result of CP.In the UK, there are 12,000 admissions per annum of patients with CP at an estimated cost of £55.8 million. The costs for loss of pancreatic function are estimated at £45-90 million and $75.1 million for endocrine and exocrine function, respectively. Chronic pain contributes $638 million per year in costs. The protracted course of CP and paucity of monetary data make quantifying direct and indirect costs difficult. An estimate of direct and indirect costs is at £285.3 million per year. This equates to £79,000 per person per year.Patients with CP consume a disproportionately high volume of resources.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661411","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Digestive enzyme","weight":0.859694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_enzyme"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.787238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"638","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/638"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"Monetary policy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Indirect costs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs"},{"name":"Per annum","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_annum"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
