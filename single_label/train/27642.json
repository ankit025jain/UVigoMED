{"id":27642,"title":"[Relationship between resting heart rate and carotid artery structure in young hypertensive patients].","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between resting heart rate (RHR) and carotid artery structure in young hypertensive patients.A total of 663 primary hypertensive patients aged between 18 and 45 (38.01 Â± 5.78) were chosen from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from January, 2009 to January, 2012. Patients under this study were divided into three groups according to their RHRs: group A (RHR<70 bpm, n = 163), group B (70 bpm?RHR<80 bpm, n = 268), group C (RHR?80 bpm, n = 232). Data on bilateral carotid artery intima-media thickness, common carotid artery diameter were detected by carotid ultra- sonography. Indexes of carotid artery were analyzed by both variance and bi-variate correlation analysis.1) Differences in the blood pressure among three groups showed statistical significance (P < 0.01), with diastolic pressure in group A higher than in group B (P < 0.05), while both systolic and diastolic pressure in group C higher than in group B (P < 0.01). 2) In group A, the right carotid artery diameter was higher than in group C (P < 0.05) and the left carotid artery diameter higher than in group B (P < 0.05) with the left carotid artery diameter higher than in group C (P < 0.05). 3) Significant positive correlations were found between RHR and blood pressure (r = 0.112,0.118) and negative correlation between RHR and left carotid artery diameter (r = -0.89). However, correlation between RHR and right carotid artery diameter was not significant (r = -0.075, P = 0.068).When blood pressure had an increase, we found that the carotid artery diameter was decreasing along with the increasing RHR among the young hypertensive patients.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009038","annotations":[{"name":"Heart","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.480975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.340467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.222135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Xinjiang Medical University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_Medical_University"},{"name":"Xinjiang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"663","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/663"},{"name":"268","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/268"},{"name":"Canonical correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Index (publishing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(publishing)"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
