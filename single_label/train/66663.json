{"id":66663,"title":"Interleukin-17 promotes development of castration-resistant prostate cancer potentially through creating an immunotolerant and pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment.","abstract":"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been demonstrated to promote formation and growth of hormone-na√Øve prostate adenocarcinoma in mice. IL-17's role in development of castration-resistant prostate cancer is unknown. In the present study, we investigated IL-17's role in castration-resistant prostate cancer in a mouse model.IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) deficient mice were interbred with Pten conditional mutant mice to produce RC(+) mice that maintained IL-17RC expression and RC(-) mice that were IL-17RC deficient. Male RC(+) and RC(-) mice were Pten-null and were castrated at 16 weeks of age when invasive prostate cancer had already formed. At 30 weeks of age, all male mice were analyzed for the prostate phenotypes.RC(-) mice displayed prostates that were smaller than RC(+) mice. Approximately 23% of prostatic glands in RC(-) mice, in contrast to 65% of prostatic glands in RC(+) mice, developed invasive adenocarcinomas. Compared to castrate RC(+) mice, castrate RC(-) mouse prostate had lower rates of cellular proliferation and higher rates of apoptosis as well as lower levels of MMP7, YBX1, MTA1, and UBE2C proteins. In addition, castrate RC(-) mouse prostate had less angiogenesis, which was associated with decreased levels of COX-2 and VEGF. Moreover, castrate RC(-) mouse prostate had fewer inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and macrophages.Taken together, our findings suggest that IL-17 promotes development of invasive prostate adenocarcinomas under castrate conditions, potentially through creating an immunotolerant and pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691769","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.843035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.817451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.756197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.74432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.735843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.689325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.59066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.264373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.227966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.122449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"MMP7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP7"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Suppressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
