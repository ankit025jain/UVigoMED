{"id":19343,"title":"[Role of anesthesiologist in prevention of perioperative infection].","abstract":"Perioprative infection has a significant impact on outcome of surgical patients. Anesthesiologists have roles in reducing infection by application of appropriate prophylactic measures. Hand hygiene is a prerequisite when contacting patients in the operating room. Bundled-preventive approaches should be applied during insertion of intravascular lines, specifically central venous lines. Application of appropriate skin preparation and/or dressings with antiseptics is important. Appropriate selection of antimicrobials depending on surgeries and patients' background, and avoidance of periopeative hypothermia are significant preventive measures for surgical wound infection. To reduce postoperative pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia, avoidance of aspiration during intubation process or mechanical ventilation is necessary. Tracheal tube with a subglottic secretion drainage port might be applied in patients anticipated to receive longer period of postoperative mechanical ventilation and to have a greater risk of postoperative pneumonia.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724436","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Antiseptic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.75984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.748581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.732163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.458068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.376971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.196775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
