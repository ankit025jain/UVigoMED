{"id":29479,"title":"Pharmacovigilance of herb-drug interactions among preoperative patients.","abstract":"The Pharmacovigilance Center of the University of Florence conducted a survey across 3 hospitals in Tuscany (Empoli, Florence, and Prato) on a sample population consisting of 478 patients admitted to the hospital for a preoperative assessment before surgical intervention. The aim of the study was to assess the concomitant use of herbal remedies (HRs) and prescribed medications and to evaluate the most important potential interactions. Almost 50% of the patients surveyed-238 of 478 (49.8 %)-used at least 1 HR. Among them, 55 (23.1%) were actually exposed to at least 1 potential interaction. In particular, 42 participants had an HR-drug interaction and 17 participants had a dietary supplement drug interaction. A large percentage of patients undergoing surgery take HRs that could potentially interact with drugs administered perioperatively. Antihypertensive, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and central nervous system (CNS) agents were the main products involved. The use of HRs is not devoid of risks and adverse effects due to potential interactions that may be serious or even lifethreatening. HR-drug interactions should be deeply investigated, especially in high-risk patient populations. Health care professionals should pay close attention and always investigate the consumption of HRs among their patients.
