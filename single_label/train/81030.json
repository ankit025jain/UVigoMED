{"id":81030,"title":"Association of inconclusive sera for human immunodeficiency virus infection with malaria and Epstein-Barr virus infection in Central Africa.","abstract":"Among 464 sera from adults in Cameroon, 56 (12.1%) gave inconclusive HIV serology. All were negative for HIV-1 DNA; 44.6% (n = 25) were significantly associated with Plasmodium (42.8%) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (17.8%) infections. In Central Africa, sera giving inconclusive results for HIV are frequently associated with malaria, EBV infection, or both.
