{"id":79233,"title":"[Complications in hearing aid fitting without otolaryngologist expertise].","abstract":"Hearing loss is a symptom. The underlying disease must be investigated by an otolaryngologist, in order to ensure timely identification of alterations in disease course, complications and newly occurring secondary disease.During the course of 1 year, 484 case studies in which treatment errors had arisen due to lack of otolaryngologist involvement during hearing aid fitting were collected from 115 practices and 7 ENT clinics, as well as from the patient representatives of the Federal Joint Committee. Depending on the type and cause of the individual complications, these were classified into five groups and described cumulatively.A total of 484 cases in which results had been incorrectly interpreted or charged to the wrong payer organization were presented in the form of a systematic overview. Furthermore, serious technical deficits, as well as unnecessary temporary and inappropriate fittings were observed.The aforementioned cases are interpreted on the basis of regulations governing hearing aid fitting and current legal practices. These case reports clearly demonstrate that otolaryngologist expertise are required not only at the first hearing aid fitting, but also for subsequent fittings, in order to appropriately treat the underlying disease. Only so can the patient be protected from damage to their health and financial complications, and health insurance providers avoid wasting resources.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463415","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.814694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.110309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Cachexia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Joint committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_committee"},{"name":"Legal practice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_practice"}]}
