{"id":34364,"title":"Object-based mental rotation and visual perspective-taking in typical development and Williams syndrome.","abstract":"This study examined Object-based (OB) rotation and Visual Perspective-Taking (VPT) abilities in Williams syndrome (WS) compared to typically developing (TD) 5-10-year-olds. Extensive difficulties with both types of imagined rotation were observed in WS; WS performance was in line with the level of ability observed in TD 5-year-olds. However, an atypical pattern of errors on OB and VPT tasks was observed in WS compared to TD groups. Deficits in imagined rotations are consistent with known atypical cortical development in WS. Such difficulties in updating the position of the self following movement in WS may have implications for large-scale spatial navigation.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742311","annotations":[{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.33963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Williams syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_syndrome"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Mental rotation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_rotation"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Writers_to_Her_Majesty's_Signet"},{"name":"Vermont Public Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_Public_Television"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Odense Boldklub","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odense_Boldklub"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Spatial navigation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_navigation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Williams F1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_F1"},{"name":"Neurotypical","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"}]}
