{"id":20738,"title":"Streptococcus pneumoniae serogroup 6 clones over two decades.","abstract":"The major evolutionary stresses on Streptococcus pneumoniae are thought to be the widespread use of antibiotics and the deployment of effective vaccines against the capsular polysaccharides. Our current knowledge of genetic lineages among pneumococcal isolates comes largely from investigations just before and after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduced in 2000. We examined 66 serogroup 6 isolates from the 1970s, long before the introduction of PCV7 and before widespread penicillin resistance was common in Birmingham, Alabama, to look for ancestors of the clones that came into play around the introduction of the PCV7 vaccine. The hypothesis was that some clonal complexes, if not individual clones, would be stable enough to persist over this period of time. We compared the 1970s isolates with 122 isolates from the 1990s in US and worldwide collections. Genotyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that while some clones were probably localized to our area, others have persisted within groups that have expanded or diminished over the years.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
