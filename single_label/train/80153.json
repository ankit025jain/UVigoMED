{"id":80153,"title":"In vitro development of Eucoleus böhmi eggs in different environmental conditions.","abstract":"The development of Eucoleus böhmi eggs was evaluated in vitro in order to acquire information on the life cycle of this neglected respiratory nematode affecting canids. Fecal cultures were prepared using fecal samples from a positive dog and maintained at different conditions of temperature (20?±?1 and 5?±?1 °C) and relative humidity (RH) (85?±?5 and 45?±?5%). Egg development was microscopically examined at days +7, +15, and +30. In addition, in order to assess the vitality of eggs maintained at 5?±?1 °C for 30 days, these latter cultures were moved, placed at 20?±?1 °C and 85?±?5% RH, and observed for further 30 and 40 days. The results showed that at 20?±?1 °C and 85?±?5% RH, the totality of eggs completed development in 30 days, while about 26 and 70% of eggs were already fully developed after 7 and 15 days, respectively. No egg development occurred after 30 days at 5?±?1 °C, while 100% of eggs placed at 5?±?1 °C for 30 days and then moved at 20?±?1 °C and 85?±?5% RH for further 40 days were found fully developed.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777343","annotations":[{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.701021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.670714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.630684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Canidae","weight":0.531033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae"},{"name":"Spawn (biology)","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(biology)"},{"name":"Relative humidity","weight":0.33386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"855","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/855"},{"name":"Solar eclipse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
