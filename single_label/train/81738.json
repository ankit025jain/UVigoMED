{"id":81738,"title":"The incidence of satellite cysts in keratocystic odontogenic tumors.","abstract":"Renaming of the Odontogenic Keratocyst as the Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor by the World Health Organization (WHO) is based on the aggressive nature of this lesion. Satellite cysts founded in the walls of the original cysts may give rise to a new lesion formation. The aim of this retrospecitve study was to identify the existence of specific features according incidence of satellite cysts and the pallisading of the basal layer of the epithelium and to establish their mutual correlation. The histopathologic data of Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor on the basis of new WHO's classification (2005) were analized. Prominent palisade basal cell layer was found in 415 (94.75%) and partially absent palisade basal cell layer in 23 (5.25%) cases. Satellite cysts were presented in prominent palisade basal cell layer in 85 specimens (20.5%) and in cases with partial absent of the palisade basal layer in 3 spicemens (13%). The higher the frequency of pallisading was the higher the frequency of satellite cysts was (p > 0.05).","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851628","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.720727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.506391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.249429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.220329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.145669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Odontogenic","weight":0.0977821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Palisade","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade"},{"name":"Keratocystic odontogenic tumour","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratocystic_odontogenic_tumour"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Satellite","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"}]}
