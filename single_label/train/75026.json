{"id":75026,"title":"[Comparison of 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling and positron emission tomography-computed tomography in the brain disorders].","abstract":"To evaluate the diagnostic agreement of 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pCASL) and ¹?F-fluorodeoxyglucose and ¹¹C-Methionine positron emission tomography-computed tomography(PET/CT) for brain disorders.3D-pCASL and PET/CT were performed on 7 patients with different brain disorders, and the diagnostic agreement was assessed by visual observation.Four tumor lesions presented hyperperfusion on 3D-pCASL, and hypermetabolism on PET/CT. One demyelinated lesion and one metabolic lesion showed hyperperfusion on 3D-pCASL, and one infected lesion showed hypoperfusion on 3D-pCASL ;all these three lesions showed hypermetabolism on PET/CT.3D-pCASL can non-invasively evaluate the perfusion state of the brain disorder in vivo and have a good dignostic consistency with PET/CT.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176205","annotations":[{"name":"Artery","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.503856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Demyelinating disease","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demyelinating_disease"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.051953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Hypermetabolism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermetabolism"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Spin (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)"},{"name":"Greenhouse gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas"}]}
