{"id":38349,"title":"Examining the relationship between heart rate and problem behavior: a case study of severe skin picking in Prader-Willi syndrome.","abstract":"Few studies have examined the relationship between heart rate and self-injurious behavior (SIB) shown by individuals with IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities). In this single-case study, we simultaneously monitored heart rate and activity levels during a functional analysis of severe skin picking behavior exhibited by a young man with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Results of the functional analysis indicated that the participant's skin picking was maintained by automatic reinforcement. A within-session analysis of the data indicated that skin picking bouts resulted in an increase in heart rate, suggesting a positive- automatic reinforcement function. These data indicate that inclusion of heart rate and activity-level monitoring during a functional analysis may provide important additional information concerning the determinants of SIB.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432859","annotations":[{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.615553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.562713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.247145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Functional analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis"},{"name":"Dermatillomania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatillomania"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"International Direct Dialling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Direct_Dialling"},{"name":"Post-hoc analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hoc_analysis"},{"name":"PWS (aircraft manufacturer)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWS_(aircraft_manufacturer)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"}]}
