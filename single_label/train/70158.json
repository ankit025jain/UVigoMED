{"id":70158,"title":"To scoop or not to scoop: the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of the scoop-shave biopsy for pigmented lesions.","abstract":"Concern over transection of melanomas has inhibited many practitioners from using the scoop-shave for removal of pigmented lesions.To assess the safety and efficacy of the scoop-shave for pigmented lesions.The practitioner's clinical diagnosis, intent (sample or completely remove), and removal technique (excision, punch, shave biopsy, or scoop-shave) were recorded. Pathology results including the status of the peripheral and deep margins were subsequently documented.Over an 8-month period, 333 procedures were performed. Of the 11 melanomas (6 in situ and 5 invasive) removed by the scoop-shave, none had positive deep margins and 6 (2 in situ and 4 invasive) were completely removed. One of the 50 dysplastic nevi removed by scoop-shave had a positive deep margin (moderately dysplastic). Forty-six dysplastic nevi were completely removed by the scoop-shave. When the practitioner's intent was \"complete removal,\" the lesion was completely removed 73.1% of the time by scoop-shave, 91% by standard excision, 18.1% by shave biopsy, and 78.6% by punch excision (p < .0001).The scoop-shave is a safe and effective technique for diagnosis and treatment of melanocytic lesions.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229784","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Dysplastic nevus","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplastic_nevus"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Nevus","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.367501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.320466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Shaving","weight":0.170908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Scoop (term)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoop_(term)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Concern Worldwide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_Worldwide"}]}
