{"id":60908,"title":"[Cost per responder associated with romiplostim and rituximab treatment for adult primary immune thrombocytopenia in France].","abstract":"This analysis compared the response rates and cost per responder associated with romiplostim and rituximab in adult immune thrombocytopenia from the French National Health System payer perspective.A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost per patient and per responder of treating adult immune thrombocytopenia patients with romiplostim versus rituximab over 6 months. A systematic literature review identified phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Published response rates were extracted (response definition: ?50×10(9) platelets/liter). Resource utilization was based on French and international treatment guidelines, and clinical expert opinion. Unit costs were derived from literature and French reimbursement lists, and included the costs of routine physician visits, treatment administration, and emergency care. Non-responders incurred bleeding-related event costs.The literature review identified a phase 3 randomized controlled trial for romiplostim with a response rate of 83%. Due to a lack of phase 3 randomized controlled trials for rituximab, a systematic review of studies was selected as the best source, reporting a response rate of 62.5%. Romiplostim and rituximab were associated with similar treatment costs, with an estimated cost per patient for romiplostim of €17,456 and €17,068 for rituximab. Rituximab resulted in a 30% higher cost per responder (€27,308 for rituximab versus €21,031 for romiplostim). Romiplostim use reduced drug administration, intravenous immunoglobulin, and bleeding-related hospitalization costs compared to rituximab.Due to its high efficacy leading to lower bleeding-related costs, romiplostim represents an efficient use of resources for adult immune thrombocytopenia patients in the French healthcare system.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797790","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.741113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.657265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.608074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.581676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.470556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.456178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"France","weight":0.445936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.28029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Romiplostim","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romiplostim"},{"name":"Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_Guidelines_from_The_Medical_Letter"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Decision analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis"}]}
