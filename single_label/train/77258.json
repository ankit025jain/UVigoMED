{"id":77258,"title":"State of the art: sleeve gastrectomy.","abstract":"In the biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) type duodenal switch, sleeve gastrectomy was applied as the restrictive part instead of a horizontal gastrectomy in the original Scopinaro type BPD. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was used as a first step in a staged concept for high-risk patients undergoing bariatric surgery. However, it is now being increasingly favored as a stand-alone procedure. This article discusses the history, surgical technique, early results, metabolic effects, mid- to long-term results regarding weight loss, improvement of comorbidities and quality of life, management of complications and indications. LSG is a safe and effective bariatric procedure with satisfying weight loss results and effects on comorbidities. Further data are required to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of LSG. In patients with very high initial BMI, LSG can be used in a staged concept. Other indications are: in cases with dense adhesions of the small bowel, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients where repeated endoscopy of the duodenum is necessary.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819496","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.843035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.82913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.403229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.168244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Duodenal switch","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenal_switch"},{"name":"Sleeve gastrectomy","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve_gastrectomy"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
