{"id":85151,"title":"Effect of Kuwanon G isolated from the root bark of Morus alba on ovalbumin-induced allergic response in a mouse model of asthma.","abstract":"The root bark of Morus alba L. (Mori Cortex Radicis; MCR) is traditionally used in Korean medicine for upper respiratory diseases. In this study, we investigated the antiasthmatic effect of kuwanon G isolated from MCR on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma in mice. Kuwanon G (1 and 10?mg/kg) was administered orally in mice once a day for 7?days during OVA airway challenge. We measured the levels of OVA-specific IgE and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in the sera or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and also counted the immune cells in BAL fluids. Histopathological changes in the lung tissues were analyzed. Kuwanon G significantly decreased the levels of OVA-specific IgE and IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the sera and BAL fluids of asthma mice. Kuwanon G reduced the numbers of inflammatory cells in the BAL fluids of asthma mice. Furthermore, the pathological feature of lungs including infiltration of inflammatory cells, thickened epithelium of bronchioles, mucus, and collagen accumulation was inhibited by kuwanon G. These results indicate that kuwanon G prevents the pathological progression of allergic asthma through the inhibition of lung destruction by inflammation and immune stimulation.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116225","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.89767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.822731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.706257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.434085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.244039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.189783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Morus (plant)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morus_(plant)"},{"name":"Traditional Korean medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Korean_medicine"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
