{"id":30169,"title":"Striatal cholinergic cell ablation attenuates L-DOPA induced dyskinesia in Parkinsonian mice.","abstract":"3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating side effect of long-term dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's Disease. At present, there are few therapeutic options for treatment of LID and mechanisms contributing to the development and maintenance of these drug-induced motor complications are not well understood. We have previously shown that pharmacological reduction of cholinergic tone attenuates the expression of LID in parkinsonian mice with established dyskinesia after chronic L-DOPA treatment. The present study was undertaken to provide anatomically specific evidence for the role of striatal cholinergic interneurons by ablating them before initiation of L-DOPA treatment and determining whether it decreases LID. We used a novel approach to ablate striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) via Cre-dependent viral expression of the diphtheria toxin A subunit (DT-A) in hemiparkinsonian transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the choline acetyltransferase promoter. We show that Cre recombinase-mediated DT-A ablation selectively eliminated ChIs when injected into striatum. The depletion of ChIs markedly attenuated LID without compromising the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA. These results provide evidence that ChIs play a key and selective role in LID and that strategies to reduce striatal cholinergic tone may represent a promising approach to decreasing L-DOPA-induced motor complications in Parkinson's disease.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553948","annotations":[{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.827622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cholinergic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Choline","weight":0.748875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.662928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.561565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Interneuron","weight":0.465467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.456322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.409085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.389465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.385045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Diphtheria","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0893438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Choline acetyltransferase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline_acetyltransferase"},{"name":"Cre recombinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cre_recombinase"},{"name":"Diphtheria toxin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria_toxin"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"}]}
