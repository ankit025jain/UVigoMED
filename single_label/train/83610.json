{"id":83610,"title":"[The species and karyotype composition of malaria mosquito larvae in different water reservoirs of the city of Moscow].","abstract":"The species and karyotype composition of malaria mosquito larvae was investigated in different water reservoirs of the city of Moscow. Cytogenetic analysis identified 2 malaria mosquito species: An. maculipennis Mg and An. messeae Fall. An. messeae was predominant in all the biotopes studied. The proportion of An. maculipennis varied from 0 to 23.8% and averaged 6.27%. An. messeae larvae were found to have chromosomal polymorphism. Individual local An. messeae populations having a definite, historically established, time and space resistant karyotype structure were shown to form in Moscow. The resistance of the karyotype structure of the populations was provided by reversible fluctuations in the rate of chromosomal inversions.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296424","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.765444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.724856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.509759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.502215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.443581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Chromosomal inversion","weight":0.265579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_inversion"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.232246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.150793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.039935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Autumn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Biotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
