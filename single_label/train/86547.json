{"id":86547,"title":"The first reference equations for the 6-minute walk distance over a 10 m course.","abstract":"As primary care practice space is mostly limited to 10?m, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) over a 10?m course is a frequently used alternative to evaluate patients' performance in COPD. Considering that course length significantly affects distance walked in 6?minutes (6MWD), this study aims to develop appropriate reference equations for the 10?m 6MWT.181 healthy subjects, aged 40-90?years, performed two standardised 6MWTs over a straight 10 m course in a cross-sectional study.Average distance achieved was 578Â±108?m and differed between males and females (p<0.001). Resulting sex-specific reference equations from multiple regression analysis included age, body mass index and change in heart rate, explaining 62% of the variance in 6MWD for males and 71% for females.The presented reference equations are the first to evaluate 6MWD over a 10?m course and expand the usefulness of the 6MWT.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764113","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.232246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Base on balls","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Measurement while drilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_while_drilling"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
