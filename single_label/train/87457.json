{"id":87457,"title":"Comparative results of treatment of open diaphyseal fractures of tibia by the use of commonly used external fixators.","abstract":"The present study was being undertaken in retrospective and prospective basis to investigate the ultimate outcome of the procedure in type IIIA and type IIIB injuries. We have used simple AO type of external fixator and applied uniplanar double tube frame and unilateral biplanar frame. Frames were selected randomly; unilateral uniplanar frame in some patients having type IIIA wound and in some patients having type IIIB wound. Similarly, unilateral biplanar frames were used in some patients with observations have shown that these external fixators are simple, easy to apply, cost-effective and yield acceptably good results. Thus, the 'external fixator' application for the management of open fractures of tibia may give good results even to the poor patients and may be suitable for underdeveloped and developing countries. A study was undertaken by the committee on fracture and traumatic surgery of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons to evaluate the efficacy and practicability of this method of treatment. The study was carried out in the department of orthopaedics, RG Kar Medical College & Hospital, Kolkata in retrospective and prospective basis since June, 2005. Forty-seven patients were selected from the outpatients department and emergency department having open fracture of shaft of the tibia with or without fracture of the fibula and were treated in the orthopaedic indoor department. The patients were followed up for 6 months to 2 years. Out of 47 cases, 2 patients could not be communicated for follow-up. Normal union could be seen in 25 patients followed by delayed union (n = 11) and malunion (n = 11). Joint shiffness was seen in 16 patients.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154154","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.827763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.691835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.619384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.609978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Kolkata","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.489419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.353472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Orthopaedic_Surgeons"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Body of tibia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_tibia"},{"name":"R.
