{"id":78361,"title":"Laryngeal papillomatosis associated dysplasia in the adult population: an update on prevalence and HPV subtyping.","abstract":"The objectives were to determine the prevalence of laryngeal dysplasia and associated human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes in adult patients, 18 years or older, suffering from laryngeal papillomatosis at a tertiary care institution.Retrospective cohort study.Patients with biopsy proven laryngeal papillomatosis were identified via chart review. All available pathology specimens were reviewed by a dedicated head and neck pathologist to confirm/refute the diagnosis of laryngeal dysplasia, and grade the level of dysplasia. Interrater agreement was compared using cross-tabulation methods. Specimens identified to be positive for dysplasia underwent further testing via in situ hybridization for low-risk (6/11) or high-risk (16/18) HPV subtypes.Of the 85 subjects identified to have laryngeal papillomatosis, 24(28%) demonstrated laryngeal dysplasia. There was good interrater agreement on the presence of dysplasia; however, there was only fair agreement on the grade of dysplasia. Of the pathology specimens tested for HPV subtype, the majority of patients (62%) were positive for HPV 6/11, including all high-grade dysplasia patients. Three (12%) dysplasia specimens were negative for both high- and low-risk HPV subtypes.We found a 28% prevalence of dysplasia in our patient population with the majority of patients positive for low-risk HPV subtypes indicating that high-risk HPV subtypes do not predispose laryngeal papilloma patients to dysplasia.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690979","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.823712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.592871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.57403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.213657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.159007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Federal subjects of Russia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia"},{"name":"Laryngeal papillomatosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_papillomatosis"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"1618","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1618"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Papillomatosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomatosis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"}]}
