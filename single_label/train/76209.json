Unavailable patients and those discharged within 24 hours were excluded. Anthropometric data included body weight, height (or length), and mid-upper arm circumference. The type, severity, and prevalence rate of malnutrition were defined based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.The sample was hospitalized children and adults: 108 and 571 were children aged 6 months to 18.9 years old and adult patients, respectively. The overall rate of pediatric wasting (weight-for-height ? -2 SD or BMI ? -2 SD, kg/m²) was 19.0% (n= 19/100) and that of stunting (height-for-age ? -2 SD) was 13.9% (n=14/101). Using either the mid-upper arm circumference <11.5 cm or the weight-for-height and weight-for-length ? -3 SD, the rate of severe wasting among children aged 6-59 months old was 7.0% (n=3/43). None of the children were obese based on weight-for-length, weight-for-height, or BMI. In adults, the prevalence of under-nutrition (BMI<18.5 kg/m²) was 33.3% (n=141/423) while that of obesity (BMI ? 30 kg/m²) was 0.9% (n=4/423). Adults admitted to the Respiratory Diseases ward had the highest prevalence of under-nutrition, 40.9% (n=38/93).The prevalence of malnutrition was high in this cohort of hospitalized patients, particularly in adults, but comparable to other published reports. Obesity was nearly nonexistent in both children and adults.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164455","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Vietnam","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.666928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.635403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.632087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.630904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.601646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.401911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.378721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.37225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Hanoi","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.27956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.170044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Wasting","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasting"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Ward (country subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
