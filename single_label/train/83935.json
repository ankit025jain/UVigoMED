{"id":83935,"title":"A mobility program for an inpatient acute care medical unit.","abstract":"For many patients, hospitalization brings prolonged periods of bed rest, which are associated with such adverse health outcomes as increased length of stay, increased risk of falls, functional decline, and extended-care facility placement. Most studies of progressive or early mobility protocols designed to minimize these adverse effects have been geared toward specific patient populations and conducted by multidisciplinary teams in either ICUs or surgical units. Very few mobility programs have been developed for and implemented on acute care medical units. This evidence-based quality improvement project describes how a mobility program, devised for and put to use on a general medical unit in a large Midwestern academic health care system, improved patient outcomes.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25210811","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.664403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.646062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.298481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Midwestern United States","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.168036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Bed rest","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_rest"},{"name":"Tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"Gulf War syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War_syndrome"}]}
