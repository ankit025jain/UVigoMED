{"id":80351,"title":"Antibody-mediated control of Trypanosoma vivax infection fails in the absence of tumour necrosis factor.","abstract":"Trypanosoma vivax causes a wasting disease affecting livestock breeding and agriculture in developing countries of sub-Sahara Africa and South America. Being an extracellular parasite, control of T. vivax has been proposed to be mediated by host antibodies. However, the use of a comparative infection model of wild-type (WT) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) knockout (TNF(-/-) ) mice shows that the latter is unable to control first-peak parasitaemia, despite the presence of specific antitrypanosome antibodies. In contrast, WT mice parasitaemia peak control coincides with a combined early onset of TNF production and induction of specific antibodies. TNF is mainly produced by liver-associated monocytes and neutrophils. In this study, no other correlation between cellular immunomodulations and peak parasitaemia control was observed, underscoring the importance of the role of TNF in the control of T. vivax infections.
