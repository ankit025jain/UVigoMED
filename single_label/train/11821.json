{"id":11821,"title":"A simple alopecia scoring system for use in colony management of laboratory-housed primates.","abstract":"Alopecia in captive primates continues to receive attention from animal care personnel and regulatory agencies. However, a method that enables personnel to reliably score alopecia over time and under various conditions has proven difficult to achieve.The scoring system developed by the behavioral and veterinary staffs at the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) uses the rule of 9s to estimate the percentage of the body affected with alopecia (severity) and how the alopecia presents itself (pattern). Training and scoring can conveniently be managed using photographic images, cage-side observations, and/or physical examinations.Personnel with varying degrees of experience were quickly trained with reliability scores ranging from 0.82 to 0.96 for severity and 0.82 to 0.89 for pattern using Cohen's ?.This system allows for reliable and consistent scoring across species, sex, age, housing condition, seasons, clinical or behavioral treatments, and level of personnel experience.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571509","annotations":[{"name":"Animal","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.514344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.500359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.445855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.338213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.309929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.242852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.141784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Baldness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldness"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Editor-in-chief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief"},{"name":"Rugby league nines","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league_nines"},{"name":"National Primate Research Center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Primate_Research_Center"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
