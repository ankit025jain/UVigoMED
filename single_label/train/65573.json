{"id":65573,"title":"[Nephrectomy: complication management].","abstract":"Nephrectomy is a standard procedure that is associated with a low complication rate.Based on an analysis of the literature, expert recommendations, and our own experience, the management of complications during and after nephrectomy is described.Complications during and after nephrectomy can be avoided by careful surgical planning, optimal approach and exposure, and precise knowledge of the principles of anatomy. The treatment of bleeding complications and injuries to neighboring structures are essential elements in the management of complications. Hernia and relaxation of the lumbar muscles should be avoided.Morbidity associated with nephrectomy can be reduced by careful surgical planning and paying attention to the basic anatomical and surgical principles.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806803","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.26782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.258198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.113965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Surgical planning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_planning"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
