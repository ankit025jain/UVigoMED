{"id":84734,"title":"Organ-dependent response in antioxidants, myoglobin and neuroglobin in goldfish (Carassius auratus) exposed to MC-RR under varying oxygen level.","abstract":"Cyanobacterial bloom, a common phenomenon nowadays often results in the depletion of dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) and releases microcystin-RR (MC-RR) in the water. Information on the combined effects of MC-RR and hypoxia on the goldfish is lacking, therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating the effect of two doses of MC-RR on the antioxidants and globin mRNA of goldfish under normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation. The result showed that MC-RR at both doses (50 and 200 ?g kg(-1) body weight) significantly (p<0.05) induced superoxide dismutase activities in the liver and kidney but catalase activities and total antioxidant capacity were low in these organs during hypoxia and reoxygenation compared to normoxia and control. Myoglobin and neuroglobin mRNAs in MC-RR group were significantly induced in the brain only and are believed to protect the brain from oxidative damage. However, other organs were unprotected and extensive damage was observed in the liver cells. Our results clearly demonstrated that MC-RR and hypoxia-reoxygenation transitions were synergistically harmful to the goldfish and could impair its adaptation to hypoxia, especially during reoxygenation.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25048936","annotations":[{"name":"Myoglobin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Globin","weight":0.51794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globin"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.394015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.199516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Neuroglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglobin"},{"name":"Goldfish","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Flower","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"}]}
