{"id":48675,"title":"Efficacy of topical recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor for treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers: Systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) is used topically in the treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers. There have been few meta-analyses of the efficacy of rhPDGF in this treatment context. The aim of this study was to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of rhPDGF in the treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers.We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge databases up to April 30, 2014. Studies were identified and selected, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. The primary efficacy outcome was complete healing rate. Adverse events were also assessed. The studies were evaluated for quality and publication bias.A total of 6 randomized controlled trials including 992 patients were selected from 173 identified studies. The studies compared rhPDGF treatment in the context of standard of care (SOC) to placebo or SOC alone. In the absence of study heterogeneity, a fixed-effects model was performed, and the combined odds ratio (OR) indicated a significantly greater complete healing rate in patients treated with rhPDGF compared to placebo or SOC alone. The ORs ranged from 0.58 to 2.77, with a combined OR of 1.53 (95% CI = 1.14 to 2.04, p = 0.004). A sensitivity analysis (leave-one-out method) indicated good study reliability, and a funnel plot with Egger test showed no publication bias.These results indicate that rhPDGF is efficacious in the treatment of diabetic lower-extremity ulcers.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060693","annotations":[{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.817921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Funnel plot","weight":0.748875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.561357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.408474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.282575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.239066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.157776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Plot (graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(graphics)"}]}
