{"id":88334,"title":"Does pernio cause nail dystrophy?","abstract":"Pernio is an abnormal inflammatory response to moisture and cold. It is characterized with inflammatory, erythema or violet, painful or itchy cutaneous lesions affecting distal extremities, particularly the fingers and toes. It is more common in women. A literature search showed no reports of nail deformities due to pernio. Here, we present a pernio case who developed nail deformities after extended exposure to cold, if combined with other facilitating factors.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864616","annotations":[{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.748652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.644115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.557647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.331718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Moisture","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Violet (color)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(color)"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Nail disease","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_disease"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
