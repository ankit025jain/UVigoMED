{"id":62332,"title":"Control of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura by sirolimus in a child with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and somatic N-RAS mutation.","abstract":"We describe an infant who developed juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) at the age of 6 months. Myeloproliferation was effectively controlled by low-dose cytosine arabinoside and 13-cis retinoic acid therapy. Two years after therapy for JMML was stopped, at the age of 5 years, the patient developed autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP was transiently controlled by plasma exchange, prednisolone, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide, but relapsed within a short time. Long-term control of TTP was established by sirolimus. Somatic N-RAS G38A?Gly13Asp substitution was restricted to hematopoietic cells. The somatic N-RAS mutation may link myeloproliferation and autoimmunity.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590757","annotations":[{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Myeloproliferative disease","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_disease"},{"name":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.82223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Retinoic acid","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid"},{"name":"Somatic cell","weight":0.817759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.697661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.679559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.581855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.450118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cytosine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cis-trans isomerism","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis-trans_isomerism"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Arabinose","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabinose"}]}
