{"id":87339,"title":"Grief and gratitude.","abstract":"People cope with loss and other traumatic life events in their own ways and according to their own individual timelines. Grief is not the same for everyone. Although people may pass through some of the same stages, they do not necessarily go through all of them or in the same order. Oftentimes, gratitude is more readily expressed nearer the time of the life-changing event--gratitude to those who provide care and comfort and gratitude for surviving the ordeal. Clients who are struggling for survival may find it easier to express their gratitude rather than their grief, but eventually expressing both is necessary for full emotional recovery.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252384","annotations":[{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Grief","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cope"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Trial by ordeal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal"},{"name":"Gratitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude"},{"name":"Clients (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clients_(album)"}]}
