{"id":34739,"title":"Current understanding of ZIP and ZnT zinc transporters in human health and diseases.","abstract":"Zinc transporters, the Zrt-, Irt-like protein (ZIP) family and the Zn transporter (ZnT) family transporters, are found in all aspects of life. Increasing evidence has clarified the molecular mechanism, in which both transporters play critical roles in cellular and physiological functions via mobilizing zinc across the cellular membrane. In the last decade, mutations in ZIP and ZnT transporter genes have been shown to be implicated in a number of inherited human diseases. Moreover, dysregulation of expression and activity of both transporters has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic diseases including cancer, immunological impairment, and neurodegenerative diseases, although comprehensive understanding is far from complete. The diverse phenotypes of diseases related to ZIP and ZnT transporters reflect the multifarious biological functions of both transporters. The present review summarizes the current understanding of ZIP and ZnT transporter functions from the standpoint of human health and diseases. The study of zinc transporters is currently of great clinical interest.
