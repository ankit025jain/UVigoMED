{"id":53603,"title":"Effects of HMGA2 on malignant degree, invasion, metastasis, proliferation and cellular morphology of ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"To analyze effects of high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) on malignant degree, invasion, metastasis, proliferation and cellular morphology of ovarian cancer cells.Three methods were applied to observe the effect on HMGA2 expression in ovarian cancer cells and ovarian epithelial cells.After the application of siRNA-HMGA2, number of T29A2-cell clones was decreased, there was significant difference compared with the negative control Block-iT. After application of let-7c, number of T29A2+ cell clones was decreased significantly, however, after the application of Anti-let-7, the number of clones restored, and there was no significant difference compared with the negative control group. After interference, the number of T29A2- cells which passed through Matrigel polycarbonate membrane were significantly lower than the negative control group. After the treatment of siRNA-HMGA2, let-7c and sh-HMGA2 respectively, growth and proliferation of T29A2-, T29A2+ and SKOV3 were slower, and the phenomenon was most obvious in SKOV3. Stable interference of HMGA2 induced mesenchymal-epithelial changes in the morphology of SKOV3-sh-HMGA2.HMGA2 can promote malignant transformation of ovarian cancer cells, enhance cell invasion and metastasis, and promote cell growth and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, which can cause ovarian cancer to progress rapidly and affect the quality of life.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507678","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.719848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.658944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.640718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.538962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.517882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.441319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.419367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Polycarbonate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate"},{"name":"High-mobility group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-mobility_group"},{"name":"HMGA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA"},{"name":"HMGA2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA2"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"T29 Heavy Tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T29_Heavy_Tank"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
