{"id":43592,"title":"Screening and selection of peptides specific for esophageal cancer cells from a phage display peptide library.","abstract":"Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract and is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the absence of early clinical symptoms. Although surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy represent the major treatment methods employed for this cancer, the prognosis of esophageal cancer remains poor.A Ph.D.-12TM Phage Display Peptide Library was screened using an esophageal cancer cell line, Eca109, and a normal esophageal epithelial cell line to identify novel ligands that selectively bind the surface of esophageal cancer cells with high affinity.Two polypeptides were isolated that exhibited higher binding affinities and specificity for the Eca109 cells. These peptides were further validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunofluorescence assays, and immunohistochemistry assays.Two polypeptides with high binding affinities to esophageal cancer cells were isolated from the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library. Further studies are needed to characterize the biological effects of these polypeptides and to explore the potential for these peptides to be used for the early screening of esophageal cancer or for cell-targeted therapies that would reduce the toxic side effects of cancer treatment.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779651","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Phage display","weight":0.573109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.265789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.25769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.199109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.120567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.026953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Trabecular meshwork","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecular_meshwork"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Doctor of Philosophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy"}]}
