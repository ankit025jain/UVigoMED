{"id":87371,"title":"[Locking plate external fixator for the treatment of middle and distal tibial fractures].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of locking plate external fixator in treating middle and distal tibial fractures.From January 2010 to January 2013,18 patients suffered from middle and distal tibial fractures were treated by locking plate external fixator,including 11 males and 7 females, with an average age of 53.5 (ranged from 13 to 80) years old,the course of disease ranged from 2 h to 3 d. According to AO classification, 4 cases were type A,11 cases were type B and 3 were type C. Among them,6 patients were open fracture, including 2 cases with type I, 3 cases with type II and 1 case with type III, according to Gustilo classification), 12 patients were close fracture. Operation time, postoperative complications were observed, and Johner-Wruhs scoring were used to evaluate clinical outcomes.All patients were followed up from 6 to 15 (meaned 11) months. Two cases occurred skin necrosis (1 case occurred bone exposure), 2 cases occurred delayed union (all were open fracture), and 1 case occurred nail infection. No screw loosening or broken occurred. According to Johner-Wruhs scoring, 10 cases obtained excellent result,6 cases good,and 2 cases fine.Locking plate external fixator for the treatment of middle and distal tibial fractures, which has advantages of lessen damage, shorter operative time, less complications and rapid functional recovery, is one of good choice.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241461","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.706223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.67,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.264181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.213079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"AC power plugs and sockets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
