{"id":86111,"title":"[Treatment of severe asthma: expert opinion].","abstract":"Severe asthmatics account 10% of the all asthmatic population. Those asthmatics whose disease is inadequately controlled account for up to half of the cost for asthma, because they have more emergency room visits, more hospital admission and greater absenteeism from work. New therapeutic options were tried in those patients whose asthma was uncontrolled with standart high dose inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta-2 agonsit combination therapy. In this paper taking into account the conditions of our country, current literature was reviewed and treatment options was discussed and graded recommendations are made for daily clinical practice in patients with severe treatment-refractory asthma.
