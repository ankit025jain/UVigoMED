{"id":8618,"title":"Prevalence of ovine footrot in the tropical climate of southern India and isolation and characterisation of Dichelobacter nodosus.","abstract":"The present communication records the first determination of the prevalence of footrot in the unexpected situation of the tropical climate of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, two states in southern India where the maximum temperature rises to 42 degrees C. In total, 73 outbreaks of footrot in Nellore brown sheep were investigated in 11 districts of Andhra Pradesh and one district of Tamil Nadu during the period March 2009 to March 2011.The overall prevalence of ovine footrot was 15%, with severity scores of 2 to 4 (lesion severity scale 0 to 4). The outbreaks occurred mostly during the rainy season, which is usually from June to December. From a total of 1,050 samples of lesions in naturally infected sheep, 478 (45.5%) were positive for Dichelobacter nodosus. Serogrouping of the isolates revealed six serogroups: A, B, C, E, F and I. Among the positive samples, 448 (93.7%) were a single serogroup and 30 (6.3%) carried a mixed infection with two serogroups. Taking single and mixed infections together, serogroup B was most frequent at 50.4% and was found in all districts, followed by serogroup I in 29.3% of samples, A in 14%, F in 6.7% and C in 5.6%. Serogroup E was detected in only one sample. Serogroups A and F were detected for the first time in India. All of 58 D. nodosus isolates in a sub-sample representing different serogroups were found to be virulent, based on the production of thermostable proteases and the presence of the integrase A gene intA. Thus, the present paper reporting isolation and characterisation of D. nodosus confirms the occurrence of virulent footrot in the tropical climate of southern India.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761738","annotations":[{"name":"Andhra Pradesh","weight":0.879079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.796219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tamil Nadu","weight":0.756221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"India","weight":0.501696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Tamil language","weight":0.399857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.381649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.264111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.238691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.207507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Tropical climate","weight":0.203229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate"},{"name":"Wet season","weight":0.189179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Integrase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase"},{"name":"Nellore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellore"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Brown","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown"}]}
