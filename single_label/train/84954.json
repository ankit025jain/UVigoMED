{"id":84954,"title":"[The impact of male phytoestrogenization on the somato-sexual development and fertility of the offsprings in rats].","abstract":"The effect of phytoestrogen-rich diet administered to male rats in a dose 20 mg/kg of body weight for 30 days with the mixture of phytoestrogens on reproductive function of male offspring and the effect of additional phytoestrogenization during milk feeding have been investigated. It was shown that male phytoestrogenization leads to feminization of the offsprings. Specifically, at birth, the ano-genital distance in males was less than that measured in control rats: (2.7 +/- 0.1) vs (3.1 +/- 0.0) mm (P < 0.05). This and additional phytoestrogenization of newborn rats during milk feeding inhibit their somatic and sexual development, weakening sexual activity in adults and reducing fertility at the expense of dectreased fertilizing capacity of sperm. A possible mechanism for the observed effects may be a reduction of relative androgenization due to increased of estradiol concentration by 3-4 times. Analysis of the data revealed a significant impact of phytoestrogens in father's diet on reproductive function of their offsprings under conditions of additional phytoestrogenization after birth.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007526","annotations":[{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.552528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.544251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0875503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Phytoestrogens","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogens"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0479663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Primogeniture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
