{"id":39589,"title":"Quantification of the fat fraction in the liver using dual-energy computed tomography and multimaterial decomposition.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of postcontrast, dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) using multimaterial decomposition (MMD) for quantification of the hepatic fat fraction (HFF).Various degrees of fatty liver were produced in 16 rabbits divided into 4 groups, by feeding them a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. After 6 weeks, precontrast, single-energy computed tomography (SECT) and postcontrast DECT were performed, and HFF maps were obtained from the DECT using MMD. T2*-corrected, multiecho, chemical-shift imaging for obtaining the proton density fat fraction (PDFF) map and histologic assessment of the hepatic steatosis were also performed. The Pearson correlations coefficients were calculated, and Bland-Altman analysis was performed of the fat fractions determined by DECT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathology. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to detect 5% hepatic steatosis or greater. The histologic HFF was used as the reference standard, and PDFFs determined by chemical-shift imaging as the technical standard.The HFFs calculated by MMD of postcontrast DECT scans were strongly correlated with those of pathology as well as the PDFFs of MRI (P < 0.05), and the mean differences of the Bland-Altman plots between the HFFs of DECT with MMD and the PDFFs of MRI were close to zero. The diagnostic performance of postcontrast DECT with MMD for detecting 5% hepatic steatosis or greater was comparable to that of the attenuation value of precontrast SECT and the PDFFs of MRI (P = 0.17-0.82).Quantification of the HFF using postcontrast DECT with MMD was feasible and showed comparable sensitivity and specificity to the precontrast SECT for the detection of hepatic steatosis.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25162291","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.648904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.630044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.439247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.387117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.38029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.230134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.065579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"}]}
