{"id":75421,"title":"Concise guidance: diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults.","abstract":"This concise guidance comprises a distillation of recommendations for the diagnosis and management of epilepsies for non-specialists and is based on updated clinical guideline 137 published by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). It is intended to provide the generalist at the front line (particularly but not exclusively in the acute hospital setting) with an accessible and up-to-date outline of key guidance on assessment, clinical management, communication and referral. Recommendations abstracted verbatim from the guideline are highlighted. Brief explanatory or supporting comment is given where appropriate.
