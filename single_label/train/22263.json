{"id":22263,"title":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gram-negative bacteria.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO) caused by gram-negative bacteria (GNB).We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with HVO from three tertiary-care hospitals over a 7-year period.Of the 313 microbiologically diagnosed HVO cases, GNB was responsible for 65 (20.8%) cases. Compared with patients with MSSA HVO, patients with GNB HVO were more likely to be female (P = 0.03) and have diabetes (P = 0.03), but less likely to have epidural abscess (P = 0.02) and paravertebral abscess (P = 0.003). Clinical outcomes were similar between the GNB and MSSA groups, including in-hospital mortality (4.6% vs. 7.8%; P = 0.53), recurrence (9.7% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.20), and sequelae (31.7% vs. 32.2%; P = 0.95). Among GNB-infected patients, recurrence rates differed according to the total duration of antibiotic treatment: 40.0% (4-6 weeks), 33.3% (6-8 weeks), and 2.1% (? 8 weeks) (P = 0.002).GNB HVO was responsible for 20.8% of adult cases of HVO. Despite some differences in clinical and radiological presentation, clinical outcomes were similar between GNB and MSSA HVO. Antibiotic therapy for ? 8 weeks may benefit patients with GNB HVO.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561018","annotations":[{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.894529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.732752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.549971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.505798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
