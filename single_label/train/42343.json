{"id":42343,"title":"Effects of vedolizumab induction therapy for patients with Crohn's disease in whom tumor necrosis factor antagonist treatment failed.","abstract":"There is an increasing need for new treatments for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in whom previous therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists has failed. We performed a placebo-controlled, phase 3, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab, an antibody against the integrin ?4?7, as induction therapy.Patients with moderately to severely active CD (CD activity index [CDAI] score, 220-400 points) were assigned randomly to groups given vedolizumab (300 mg) or placebo intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary analysis involved 315 patients with previous TNF antagonist failure (ie, an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance of ?1 TNF antagonists); we determined the proportion of patients in clinical remission (CDAI, ?150 points) at week 6. Secondary analyses evaluated outcomes at weeks 6 and 10 in this population and in the overall population (N = 416), which included patients naive to TNF antagonist therapy (n = 101).Among patients who had experienced previous TNF antagonist failure, 15.2% of those given vedolizumab and 12.1% of those given placebo were in remission at week 6 (P = .433). At week 10, a higher proportion of this population given vedolizumab was in remission (26.6%) than those given placebo (12.1%) (nominal P = .001; relative risk, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.6). A higher proportion of patients with previous TNF antagonist failure given vedolizumab also had a CDAI-100 response (?100-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at week 6 than those given placebo (39.2% vs 22.3%; nominal P = .001; relative risk, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5). Adverse event results were similar among all groups.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859203","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.826185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.664758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.602988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.525167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"TNF inhibitor","weight":0.298912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_inhibitor"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
