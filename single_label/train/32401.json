{"id":32401,"title":"Incontinentia pigmenti: report on data from 2000 to 2013.","abstract":"We report here on the building-up of a database of information related to 386 cases of Incontinentia Pigmenti collected in a thirteen-year activity (2000-2013) at our centre of expertise. The database has been constructed on the basis of a continuous collection of patients (27.6/year), the majority diagnosed as sporadic cases (75.6%). This activity has generated a rich source of information for future research studies by integrating molecular/clinical data with scientific knowledge. We describe the content, architecture and future utility of this collection of data on IP to offer comprehensive anonymous information to the international scientific community.
