{"id":11369,"title":"Corneal lymphatic valve formation in relation to lymphangiogenesis.","abstract":"We have recently provided evidence showing that luminal lymphatic valves are formed right after the onset of corneal inflammatory lymphangiogenesis (LG). The purpose of this study was to further characterize the long-term time course, spatial distribution, directional orientation, and functional implications of the valve formation in relation to corneal LG.Corneal LG was induced in normal adult BALB/c mice by a modified suture placement model with equal distribution in the nasal and temporal side. Whole-mount corneas were harvested every 2 weeks for up to 8 weeks post suturing for immunofluorescent microscopic assays. Quantitative analysis on both lymphatic vessels and valves was performed by using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. Corneal lymphatic live imaging was performed to show functional drainage of the valves.Lymphatic vessel invasion areas at 4, 6, and 8 weeks were significantly less than the peak at 2 weeks post corneal suturing. In contrast, the ratio of lymphatic valves to vessel invasion area was at its lowest at 2 weeks with a peak approximately at 6 weeks post suturing. Lymphatic valves were more localized in the nasal quadrant at all time points studied, and most of the well-formed valves were directionally oriented toward the limbus. The lymphatic valves function to guide lymphatic drainage outside the cornea.This study presents new insights into corneal lymphatic valve formation and function in inflammatory LG. Further investigation on lymphatic valves may provide novel strategies to interfere with lymphatic maturation and function and to treat lymphatic-related disorders.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Animal
