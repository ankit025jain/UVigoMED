{"id":45637,"title":"Clinicopathological characteristics of PIK3CA and HBx mutations in Korean patients with hepatocellular carcinomas.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common form of cancer in the Korean population, caused primarily by infection with either the Hepatitis B or C virus. Progression of this disease is frequently associated with mutations in either phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha (PIK3CA) or hepatitis B virus X (HBx) gene. Previous studies have examined the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in HCC, although the clinical significance of these mutations has not been studied in a Korean population. In addition, HBx appears to play a key role in modulating a wide range of cellular functions, leading to HCC. In this study, we examined microdissected tumor samples from 50 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy at Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center. These patients were screened for mutations in PIK3CA and HBx to identify the clinical outcomes associated with these mutations. Exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA and the entirety of HBx were screened for mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 7 of 50 patients (14%). Among the 42 patients who were seropositive for hepatitis B, 17 (40.5%) had HBx mutations and 4 (9.52%) had mutations in PIK3CA. PIK3CA mutations were strongly correlated with tumor size. Patients harboring HBx mutations exhibited a longer time to recurrence; this difference was statistically significant not only in comparison with the PIK3CA mutation but also compared with those without any mutations. This result suggests a role for PIK3CA and HBx mutations as prognostic markers in HCC.
