{"id":71601,"title":"Systematic review of high-dose and standard-dose chemotherapies in the treatment of primary well-differentiated osteosarcoma.","abstract":"The objective of this study is to evaluate whether high-dose chemotherapy is more efficacious than standard-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of primary well-differentiated osteosarcoma. The Cochrane systematic evaluation method was adopted. A database search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, OVID, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database and the Chinese Biomedical Literature CD-ROM Database. The quality of the included studies was jointly evaluated by two reviewers, and homogeneous studies were included for meta-analysis. A total of five studies were included in this meta-analysis, with 1,415 subjects with primary, nonmetastatic, well-differentiated osteosarcoma in the limbs. No statistically significant differences were found between the high-dose chemotherapy group and the low-dose group in 5-year event-free survival [RR 1.04, 95 %CI (0.95, 1.13)], 5-year overall survival [RR 1.02, 95 %CI (0.95, 1.10)], local recurrence rate [RR 0.90, 95 %CI (0.59, 1.39)], proportion of subjects with good histological response [RR 0.93, 95 %CI (0.81, 1.07)], or limb salvage rate [RR 0.97, 95 %CI (0.92, 1.02)]. A statistically significant difference was observed in the 5-year event-free survival between the subjects with good histological response to preoperative chemotherapy and the subjects with poor histological response [RR 1.55, 95 %CI (1.19, 2.00), P?<?0.001]. High-dose chemotherapy did not show superior efficacy to low-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of primary well-differentiated osteosarcoma. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to provide additional reliable evidence for our observation.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25053592","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.622356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.555014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.385295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.347521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"China","weight":0.205101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.115606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Central Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"CD-ROM","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM"}]}
