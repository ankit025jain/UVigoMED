{"id":82435,"title":"[Relationship between menopause and tooth loss].","abstract":"This work proposes to evaluate the relationship between menopause and oral health by a cross-sectional study conducted on 202 menopausal women with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and not menopausal women, with backgrounds socio-economic and socio-cultural variety and aged 42 to 80 years. Two hundred and two patients were the subject of an interrogation and a detailed clinical examination. Relations between menopausal and dental mortality were determined by bi and multi analyses varied. The result notes that the number of missing teeth is lowest among women from backgrounds socio - economic favored (p = 0.015). In addition, the number of missing teeth is highly correlated with dry mouth (p = 0,000). On the other hand, postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy have less missing teeth than postmenopausal women without hormone replacement therapy, (p = 0.02). In addition, the number of missing teeth is significantly increased in non-diabetic heart women, (OR = 1,215). This result is essentially the same in heart patient, non-diabetic postmenopausal patients without HRT, (OR = 1,214). Finally, we note a link between stressful events and dental mortality (p = 0.042).","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624645","annotations":[{"name":"Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)","weight":0.835613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.616243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.615553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.548086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.447452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.424377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.397007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.276266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Interrogation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation"},{"name":"Sociocultural evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution"}]}
