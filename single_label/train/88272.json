{"id":88272,"title":"Structural changes of the carpal tunnel, median nerve and flexor tendons in MRI before and after endoscopic carpal tunnel release.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural changes of the carpal tunnel, median nerve, and flexor tendons in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR). We studied 36 hands undergoing ECTR. In MRI, the cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel and the median nerve at the hamate and the pisiform levels were measured. The distance from the volar side of carpal bone to the median nerve or tendons and the volar displacement were measured. In post-operative MRI, the transverse carpal ligament could not be well delineated and the carpal tunnel was significantly enlarged both at the hamate and pisiform levels. The median nerve was enlarged at the hamate level. The median nerve and flexor tendons significantly moved to the volar side. The volar displacement of the median nerve and flexor digitorum superficialis in the long and ring fingers was greater than the other tendons.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875502","annotations":[{"name":"Median nerve","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve"},{"name":"Flexor retinaculum of the hand","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_retinaculum_of_the_hand"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle","weight":0.799206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_digitorum_superficialis_muscle"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.792725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.785321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.702046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.496418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Pisiform bone","weight":0.429026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisiform_bone"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.343279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Hamate bone","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamate_bone"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council_on_Tolerance_and_Reconciliation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
