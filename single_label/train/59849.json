{"id":59849,"title":"Busuishengxue ranules mediate their effects upon non-severe aplastic anemia via mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.","abstract":"To observe the clinical efficacy of Busuishengxue granules on non-severe aplastic anemia (NSAA) and investigate its effect on the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway.Sixty NSAA patients were divided equally into two groups. Subjects in the experimental group were treated with Busuishengxue granules, and the control group with Zaizaoshengxue tablets. The treatment course was 6 months and curative efficacy was compared between the two groups as well as with 10 healthy individuals. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Western blotting was employed to detect the expression of enzymes in the MAPK/ERK pathway.The efficacy of Busuishengxue granules was significantly better than that of Zaizaoshengxue tablets (P < 0.05). Before treatment, expression of JNK, phospho-ERK 1/2 and p-JNK was higher, and [Ca2+]i higher, than that of the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment with Busuishengxue granules, expression of all enzymes related to signal transduction pathways in the blood cells of NSSA patients were altered to different degrees.Busuishengxue granules had a better effect with regard to improving symptom scores, increasing the number of blood leukocytes, and increasing hemoglobin levels than Zaizaosh-engxue tablets, and they differed slightly in terms of increasing the number of platelets.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102686","annotations":[{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.737987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.621983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.429766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
