{"id":70054,"title":"The efficacy of mammography boot camp to improve the performance of radiologists.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of a mammography boot camp (MBC) to improve radiologists' performance in interpreting mammograms in the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) in Korea.Between January and July of 2013, 141 radiologists were invited to a 3-day educational program composed of lectures and group practice readings using 250 digital mammography cases. The radiologists' performance in interpreting mammograms were evaluated using a pre- and post-camp test set of 25 cases validated prior to the camp by experienced breast radiologists. Factors affecting the radiologists' performance, including age, type of attending institution, and type of test set cases, were analyzed.The average scores of the pre- and post-camp tests were 56.0 ± 12.2 and 78.3 ± 9.2, respectively (p < 0.001). The post-camp test scores were higher than the pre-camp test scores for all age groups and all types of attending institutions (p < 0.001). The rate of incorrect answers in the post-camp test decreased compared to the pre-camp test for all suspicious cases, but not for negative cases (p > 0.05).The MBC improves radiologists' performance in interpreting mammograms irrespective of age and type of attending institution. Improved interpretation is observed for suspicious cases, but not for negative cases.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246818","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.658497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.1695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.135256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munhwa_Broadcasting_Corporation"},{"name":"Digital mammography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mammography"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Typeface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface"},{"name":"Camp (style)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)"},{"name":"Boot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Test set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set"},{"name":"Group medical practice in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_medical_practice_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Recruit training","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruit_training"}]}
