{"id":47307,"title":"Fatty liver and serum cholinesterase are independently correlated with HbA1c levels: cross-sectional analysis of 5384 people.","abstract":"To examine the association between glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fatty liver markers.This cross-sectional analysis stratified subjects into quintiles based on HbA1c. Fatty liver using ultrasonography scores (FLUS) were assigned as follows: 2 points, moderate or severe fatty liver; 1 point, mild fatty liver; and 0 points, normal liver. Subjects with viral hepatitis, alcohol intake >175 g/week or receiving hypoglycaemic treatment were excluded.The study included 5384 subjects. Serum cholinesterase (ChE) and FLUS showed a significant graded increase with increasing HbA1c. In linear regression analysis stratified by body mass index (BMI) and age, ChE and FLUS were significantly associated with lower (1 + 2) and higher (3 + 4 + 5) HbA1c quintiles, respectively, independent of BMI and age.The findings show that both ChE and FLUS are significantly correlated with HbA1c, independent of BMI and age.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595150","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.65969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.63328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.588761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Cholinesterase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinesterase"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chemical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Household income in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
