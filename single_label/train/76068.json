{"id":76068,"title":"[Chicory extract's influence on gut bacteria of abdominal obesity rat].","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy mechanisme of chicory extract interventing abdominal obesity rat from the aspect of gut bacteria.Male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups, namely the normal group, model group, large and small dose group of chicory and the fenofibrate group. Normal group was given deionized water, the other group was given fructose water and give the medical treatment of chicory and fenofibrate. Assay triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL by biochemical methods and measure body weight and abdominal circumference and microscopicly observe the count changes of gut bacteria through real-time PCR method.Compared with normal group, the triglyceride level and abdominal circumference were significantly higher (P < 0.05), weight and high-density lipoprotein increased but no significant changes and E. coli, lactobacillus increased significantly. Compared with model group, chicory extract large and small dose group and the fenofibrate group can significantly reduce triglyceride levels (P < 0.05), reduce the number of E. coli and Lactobacillus and increase the number of bifidobacteria. The fenofibrate group can significantly reduce total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein levels.The chicory's treatment effect on abdominal obesity is significant. The efficacy mechanisme intervention abdominal obesity may be related to the reduction of the number of lactic acid bacteria and E. coli and the increase of bifidobacteria.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272847","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Chicory","weight":0.891156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicory"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium","weight":0.878915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"},{"name":"Lactic acid bacteria","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Fructose","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.617648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.345704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.250128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.190815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Purified water","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water"},{"name":"Fenofibrate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenofibrate"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
