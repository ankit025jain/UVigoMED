{"id":51621,"title":"The development of new basal insulins: is there any clinical advantage with their use in type 2 diabetes?","abstract":"The basal insulin products currently on market do not optimally mimic endogenous insulin secretion. These unmet clinical needs have fueled the development of new basal insulin analogues for improving their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics profile.We review the recent literature investigating the efficacy and safety of new basal insulin analogues in type 2 diabetes, as in the USA, insulin utilization accounted for 26% of treatment visits for these patients in 2012. Insulin degludec is a desB30 insulin acylated at the LysB29 residue with a glutamate linker and 16-carbon fatty diacyl side chain. Insulin lispro has been PEGylated at lysine B28, via a urethane bond, which increases the hydrodynamic size of the molecule and reduces its absorption and clearance following subcutaneous administration. Glargine U300 represents a new high-strength glargine formulation (300 U/ml): once injected, U300 forms a compact subcutaneous depot with a smaller surface area to produce a more gradual and prolonged release. Both PEG-lispro and glargine U300 are not yet on the market.Ultra-long acting and high-strength formulations of new basal analogues have the potential for less glycemic variability, less (nocturnal) hypoglycemia and weight-loss advantage for PEG-lispro. However, these new basal insulin analogues need to be monitored closely for adverse signals.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673155","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.734501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.675266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.622055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.551787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.380041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.374405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Insulin glargine","weight":0.317942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_glargine"},{"name":"Insulin analog","weight":0.268808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_analog"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.264995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Basal rate","weight":0.209117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_rate"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.122093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0886576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.0517852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Polyurethane","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Insulin lispro","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_lispro"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Acylation","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acylation"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"}]}
