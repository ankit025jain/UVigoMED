{"id":63052,"title":"Iron status of pregnant Indian women from an area of active iron supplementation.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the iron status of pregnant tribal women from Ramtek, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India using a combination of indices.A community-based observational study was conducted to assess iron status using a convenience sample of pregnant Indian tribal women from Ramtek. Pregnant women were recruited at 13 to 22 wk gestation (first visit; n = 211) and followed to 29 to 42 wk gestation (second visit; n = 177) of pregnancy. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data; iron supplement intake; and blood samples for estimating hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were obtained.The mean (SD) Hb concentration at recruitment was 106 (15) g/L and 106 (14) g/L at the second visit; 41% of the women at recruitment and 55% at second visit were anemic (14% higher, PÂ < 0.001). No women at recruitment and 3.7% at second visit had SF concentration < 15 ng/mL; and 3.3% at recruitment and 3.9% at the second visit had sTfR > 4.4 ng/mL (0.6% higher, P = 0.179). Almost 62% and 71% of pregnant women used iron supplements at both visits, respectively. Iron supplement intake > 7 d in the preceding month improved the Hb concentration by 3.23 g/L and reduced sTfR concentration by 13%; women who were breastfeeding at the time of recruitment had 11% higher SF concentration.The iron indices suggest that pregnant tribal women of central India, although anemic, had good iron status. Use of iron supplements > 7 d in the preceding month improved iron status; however, non-iron-deficiency anemia persisted in this group.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484679","annotations":[{"name":"Iron supplements","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplements"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.828943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Transferrin receptor","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.602939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"India","weight":0.512734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.475277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Maharashtra","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Tribe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
