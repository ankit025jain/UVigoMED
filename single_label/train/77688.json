{"id":77688,"title":"Stooped postures are modified by pretask walking in a simulated weed-pulling task.","abstract":"Seasonal agricultural workers are hired in some sectors for intermittent manual weed removal, a stoop and grasp harvesting task likely similar to those associated with the high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in agriculture. Evaluation of this task in an experimental situation would be useful for identifying and controlling musculoskeletal injury risks, presuming a valid experimental model of the task can be created. The purpose of the present study was to examine how a relevant work-related task, namely prolonged walking, altered the biomechanics of manual weed removal in a laboratory setting. Preliminary field assessments informed the development and analysis of a simulated manual weed removal with two separate conditions: not primed, where 11 participants (4 female, mean age 21.6 years) manually removed a simulated weed six times, and primed, where 23 participants (13 female, mean age 22.1 years) walked 1600 m prior to manually removing the same simulated weed six successive times. Segment end point markers and experimental motion capture were used to determine hip, knee, and ankle angles, as well as toe-target proximity, during weed removal. Significant differences between primed and not primed participants were found for angular displacement at the ankle (t(32) = 5.08, P < .001) and toe-target proximity (t(32) = 2.78, P = .008), where primed participants had increased ankle flexion and a greater distance to the weed, leading to decreased trunk flexion during the harvesting task. These findings suggest that priming can positively influence whole-body postures for manual weed removal.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417529","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.462384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.422869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.376917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.255832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Weed","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.151959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Angular displacement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_displacement"},{"name":"Motion capture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_injury"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"1600","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1600"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Primer (paint)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(paint)"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Echinopsis pachanoi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinopsis_pachanoi"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
