{"id":17322,"title":"Novel vaccination strategies against tuberculosis.","abstract":"The tuberculosis (TB) pandemic continues to rampage despite widespread use of the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin) vaccine. Novel vaccination strategies are urgently needed to arrest global transmission and prevent the uncontrolled development of multidrug-resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in the field of vaccine development with numerous innovative preclinical candidates and more than a dozen vaccines in clinical trials. These vaccines are developed either as boosters of the current BCG vaccine or as novel prime vaccines to replace BCG. Given the enormous prevalence of latent TB infection, vaccines that are protective on top of an already established infection remain a high priority and a significant scientific challenge. Here we discuss the current state of TB vaccine research and development, our understanding of the underlying immunology, and the requirements for an efficient TB vaccine.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890836","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.613123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.537024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Research and development","weight":0.290576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"BCG vaccine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG_vaccine"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.027246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
