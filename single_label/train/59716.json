{"id":59716,"title":"[Refractory cytopenia of children and acquired aplastic anemia: a clinical and pathological study of 130 cases].","abstract":"To explore the clinical characteristics and histopathological morphology features of bone marrow biopsies between refractory cytopenia of children (RCC) and acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) to facilitate the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment of RCC and AAA.We retrospectively analyzed clinical data and histopathological morphology of bone marrow biopsies in RCC or AAA patients referred to our hospital from January 2011 to December 2012.There were totally 130 patients studied. The final diagnoses of them were RCC in 78 cases (60.0%) and AAA in 52 cases (40.0%). The median WBC count, absolute neutrophil count, blood platelet count, hemoglobin level, and reticulocyte count were all higher in RCC children than AAA (P<0.01). All of RCC patients showed hypocellular biopsy specimens, and 84.6% (66/78) of them had cellularity of bone marrow biopsy specimens ranging from 20% to 60%. Patchy pattern distribution was seen in 98.7% (77/78) of RCC cases, and micromegakaryocyte was found in 61.5% (48/78) of RCC cases. All of AAA patients showed severe hypocellular biopsy specimens, and 88.5% (46/52) of them had cellularity of bone marrow biopsy specimens under 5%. Megakaryocyte was not found in 98.1% (51/52) of AAA cases. The response rates of immunosuppressive therapy using CsA ± rabbit anti- thymocyte globulin ± androgen ± traditional Chinese medicine for patients with RCC and AAA were 59.5% and 26.9% at 3 months (P=0.011), and 75.0% and 38.1% at 6 months, respectively (P=0.007).RCC patients showed milder cytopenia and bone marrow hyperplasia than AAA. Patchy distribution of hematopoietic cells, erythroid islands with a marked left shift and micromegakaryocytes were decisive histomorphological patterns used to separate RCC from SAA. Immunosuppressive therapy using CsA ± rabbit anti- thymocyte globulin ± androgen ± traditional chinese medicine was an effective therapy in patients with RCC and AAA, and the outcome of immunosuppressive therapy for RCC patients was superior to that of AAA patients.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152119","annotations":[{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Reticulocyte","weight":0.750037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulocyte"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.714035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.713684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.703173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.686898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.621983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Megakaryocyte","weight":0.39465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megakaryocyte"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.303233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.249996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Absolute neutrophil count","weight":0.172569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_neutrophil_count"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Thymocyte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymocyte"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
