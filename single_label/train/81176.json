{"id":81176,"title":"Knowledge, attitudes and practices among parents and teachers about soil-transmitted helminthiasis control programs for school children in Guimaras, Philippines.","abstract":"We determined the attitudes toward and practices regarding soil-transmitted helminthes (STH) control among parents and school teachers to identify reasons behind attitudes and practices that do not promote STH control. Written knowledge, attitudes and practices surveys were distributed to parents (N = 531) and teachers (N = 105) of students at 11 elementary schools in Guimaras Province, the Philippines. The survey addressed attitudes about mass drug administration (MDA), knowledge about STH control, hygienic practices, and acceptability of distributing deworming tablets among teachers. More than 90% of parents and teachers held favorable attitudes towards MDA. Sixty-nine percent of parents and 75.5% of teachers believed stool exams were necessary before MDA. Thirty-seven percent of parents stated they would not allow teachers to administer deworming tablets and 91.5% of parents feared teachers would not detect side effects of the medication. Forty-eight percent of teachers felt they could safely give deworming tablets and 81.4% of teachers were afraid of managing the side effects of deworming tablets. Forty-seven point eight percent of parents and 42.2% of teachers stated defecation in the open occured in their community. Although attitudes toward STH control were largely favorable, misconceptions about the MDA strategy, lack of support for teachers giving deworming tablets, and the practice of open defecation still exist as barriers to STH control efforts. The next step to achieve effective STH control will be to clarify misconceptions in education campaigns, to train teachers about medication administration, campaign to improve sanitation and hygiene and begin targeted mass treatment in Guimaras, the Philippines.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437309","annotations":[{"name":"Philippines","weight":0.758285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"},{"name":"School","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.501421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.38097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.210315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Elementary school","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.065791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Helminthiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthiasis"},{"name":"Mass drug administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_drug_administration"},{"name":"Guimaras","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guimaras"},{"name":"Deworming","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworming"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"531","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/531"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Political campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign"},{"name":"Teacher education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher_education"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Train","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train"}]}
