{"id":69080,"title":"Long-term follow-up of kidney transplants in a region of Southern Italy.","abstract":"Several donor and recipient factors are known to be associated with graft loss in a kidney transplant. In this retrospective single-center study, we analyzed the effect of clinical and immunologic factors on kidney transplant outcomes in our region in Italy.The study included 245 transplanted recipients from deceased donors at Federico II University of Naples, Kidney Transplant Centre, between the years 2000 and 2006. Age, cause of death, history of hypertension, hypotension or cardiac arrest, length of time spent in the intensive care unit, serum creatinine levels and human leukocyte antigen typing all were evaluated in the donors. Age, time spent on the wait list, human leukocyte antigen typing, antibody sensitization, and allocation were evaluated in the recipients. Age, donor/recipient matching, and human leukocyte antigen mismatches also were evaluated.Cox regression analysis showed that in recipients, time spent on the wait list increased the risk of restarting dialysis (OR 1.019, 95% CI: 1.000-1.038; P = .050) and dying (OR 1.017, 95% CI: 1.000-1.038; P = .032). Patients who received a kidney from a donor with a history of hypertension presented a major risk of death (OR 3.212, 95% CI: 1.190-8.668; P = .021), while human leukocyte antigen-A mismatch increased the risk of restarting dialysis (OR 3.137, 95% CI: 1.255-7.842; P = .014).In our study, in recipients, time spent on the wait list, and a history of hypertension were associated with a greater risk of death. Human leukocyte antigen-A mismatch is associated with a greater risk of restarting dialysis.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471718","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.808614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.718098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.704888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.615992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.484469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.430911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Naples","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1908","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
