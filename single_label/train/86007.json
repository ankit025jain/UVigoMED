{"id":86007,"title":"Dual-energy CT pulmonary angiography in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: value for the detection and quantification of pulmonary venous congestion.","abstract":"To evaluate if vascular and pulmonary parenchymal enhancement values in dual-energy (DE) CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) can suggest the diagnosis of pulmonary congestion.DE-CTPA images of 90 out of 1321 patients negative for pulmonary embolism showed signs of congestive heart failure. We measured DE-derived pulmonary parenchymal [perfused blood volume (PBV)], pulmonary artery (PA) and left atrium (LA) enhancement values in these patients and in 142 control patients. Enhancement values were compared between the populations and correlated with serum values of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and proBNP, where available.No significant difference of PBV but significant differences of mean PA and LA enhancement and individual enhancement differences (PA?-?LA) were found between the populations. PA?-?LA was higher in patients with elevated BNP and proBNP and was positively correlated with these values. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a moderate discriminatory power of the PA?-?LA difference for the presence of cardiac biomarker elevations.PBV in DE-CTPA is not altered in patients with signs of congestive heart failure. However, differences in enhancement values in the pre- and post-pulmonary vessels were found in comparison with the control population.Altered pulmonary vascular haemodynamics in pulmonary venous congestion are not reflected in dual-energy-derived PBV maps. In the diagnosis of left heart failure in patients with chest pain and dyspnoea, density measurements in the pulmonary artery and in the left atrium in CTPA images may be a helpful diagnostic tool.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract
