{"id":84865,"title":"[The main repair pathways of double-strand breaks in the genomic DNA and interactions between them].","abstract":"Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) resulting from cellular metabolic processes and external factors are a serious threat to the stability of the genome. Therefore, the cells have different molecular mechanisms for the efficient repair of this type of d√°-mage. In this review we consider two main biochemical pathways of double-strand DNA breaks repair in eukaryotic cells--DNA strands nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination between sister chromatids or chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Numerous data obtained recently for various eukaryotic cells suggest that complex interplay between the major DSB repair pathways normally facilitate the efficient repair and maintenance of the structural and functional genome integrity, but at the same time, under conditions ofgenotoxic factors exposure may induce increased genomic instability.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25019146","annotations":[{"name":"Homologous recombination","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Chromatid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid"},{"name":"Homologous chromosome","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_chromosome"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sister chromatids","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_chromatids"},{"name":"Non-homologous end joining","weight":0.408914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
