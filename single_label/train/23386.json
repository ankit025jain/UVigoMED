{"id":23386,"title":"Evaluating the diagnoses of gastric antral lesions using magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging in a Chinese population.","abstract":"To evaluate the accuracy of diagnosing gastric antral lesions in routine clinical practice using magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) as a real-time diagnosing technique.Consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy were selected for the study. In each patient, the mucosa of the gastric antrum was observed by M-NBI, and the gastric microstructure was categorized into five types (A-E). Based on these patterns, histological types were predicted in a real-time manner. The accuracy of these predictions was evaluated based on histological findings. Inter-observer agreement was also assessed.A total of 207 sites in 90 patients were examined by M-NBI. Compared with type A gastric microstructure, types B and C gastric microstructure showed a significantly higher degree of inflammation (P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of types B + C microstructure as a predictor of gastric inflammation were 85.4, 81.7 and 83.1 %, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of type D microstructure as a predictor of gastric intestinal metaplasia were 71.8, 95.2 and 90.8 %, respectively, and those of type E microstructure as a predictor of early gastric cancer were 80.0, 98.9 and 97.6 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of type B alone, type C alone and types B + C combined for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection were 52.2 and 87.0 %, 22.8 and 92.2 %, 75.0 and 79.1 %, respectively. The kappa value for the inter-observer agreement was 0.715 (95 % confidence interval 0.655-0.895).In conclusion, M-NBI can significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction of histopathology of gastric antral lesions in vivo, implying the possibility of using M-NBI as an effective diagnosis technique.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488235","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Metaplasia","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.74932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.702753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.455681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Intestinal metaplasia","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_metaplasia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.276854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Antrum","weight":0.249429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antrum"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Pyloric antrum","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyloric_antrum"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"American English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Magnification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
