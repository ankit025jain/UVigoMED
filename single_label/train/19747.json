{"id":19747,"title":"[Vaginal colonization by Candida spp. Frequency and description of the species isolated in asymptomatic women].","abstract":"During reproductive age 75% of women experience at least one episode of vulvovaginal candidiasis, approximately 6% to 55% of healthy women are asymptomatic carriers. In Mexico there are no current data of the frequency of vaginal colonization by Candida in the general population.To determine the frequency of the colonization by Candida species in asymptomatic women.A descriptive, open, observational, prospective, cross sectional study was carried out in adult women attending the cervical cytology department at Hospital General Dr. Manuel Gea Gonz√°lez in Mexico City. The study was conducted from January to May 2013.There were a total of 150 samples of asymptomatic women between 15 and 77 years (mean 43 years). We obtained positive culture for Candida in 19 samples (12.6 %). 47% of the species corresponded to C. albicans, however, it was isolated other species such as C. krusei in 26%, C. glabrata (21%) and C. tropicalis by 15%.Our findings are consistent with data reported in the literature. It is relevant the isolation of non-albicans Candida species. These findings may be caused by an increase of inappropriate therapies.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701855","annotations":[{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.609038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.562205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.512941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.507163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.361876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.352134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mexico City","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.270298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Candida krusei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_krusei"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Cross section (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Panaeolus tropicalis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panaeolus_tropicalis"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Gea (spider)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gea_(spider)"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
