{"id":62080,"title":"Overexpression of microRNA-143 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells.","abstract":"Microrna-143 (miR-143) has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor, yet its role in hematological tumors has not been determined. Thus, we aimed to explore the expression and function of miR-143 in leukemia cells. miR-143 expression was assessed in bone marrow samples from 63 leukemia patients and 15 healthy controls using q-PCR, and its correlation with DNMT3A expression was determined. In addition, after lentiviral-mediated miR-143 overexpression, K562 cell proliferation was evaluated using CCK-8 analysis; cell cycle progression and apoptosis were determined using flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 and -9 was assessed by q-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Leukemia patients had significantly lower relative miR-143 expression than healthy controls (P=0.004), and the expression levels of miR143 and DNMTA3A were negatively correlated (r=-0.663, P=0.001). Overexpression of miR-143 decreased DNMT3A mRNA and protein expression, and significantly reduced K562 cell proliferation at 72 and 96 h (both P ? 0.018). In addition, reduced colony formation and cell cycle progression were observed upon miR-143 overexpression. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the early apoptosis rate was higher in the miR-143 group than the rate in the NC group. Bcl-2 mRNA expression and pro-caspase-3 and -9 protein expression were reduced in the miR-143-expressing cells. These findings suggest that miR-143 plays an important role in leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis, possibly through silencing of DNMT3A. Further studies are necessary to determine the prognostic value and therapeutic potential of targeting miR-143.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626955","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.680784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"DNA methyltransferase","weight":0.665178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.517193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
