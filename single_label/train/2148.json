{"id":2148,"title":"Gut microbiota in cirrhotic liver transplant candidates.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the gut microflora of liver transplant candidates.Fecal microflora of 20 cirrhotic liver transplant candidates was analyzed basing on prospectively collected stool samples. The results were compared with those of 20 non-cirrhotic patients with liver disease and/or abnormal liver function tests, 20 patients with Crohnâ€™s disease, and 20 patients without any gastrointestinal disease. Moreover, correlations between particular counts of microbiota, as well as between microbial counts and stool pH were examined.The pattern of fecal microbiota of liver transplant candidates was characterized by increased counts of lactobacilli (p=0.001), including hydrogen peroxide producing strains (p=0.008). In these patients, lactobacilli were positively correlated to enterococci (p=0.006) and bifidobacteria (p=0.004). No correlations other than those observed for lactobacilli in general were observed between hydrogen peroxide producing lactobacilli and the remaining microbiota. Increased yeast and Escherichia coli counts were associated with a tendency towards lower (p=0.095) and higher (p=0.072) stool pH, respectively.Surprisingly, gut microflora of liver transplant candidates with cirrhosis is particularly enriched with lactobacilli, including hydrogen peroxide producing strains. Thus, the use of other potentially beneficial microorganisms, such as particular yeast strains, might be more appropriate for these patients.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436359","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.486533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.364973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.296392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.13094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"}]}
