{"id":88539,"title":"The oculocardiac reflex in an adult with a non-displaced orbital floor fracture.","abstract":"The current dogma is that the oculocardiac reflex from orbital trapdoor fractures occurs only in children and young adults. We present the occurrence of the oculocardiac reflex in an adult with a non-displaced orbital floor fracture. CT demonstrated the adventitia surrounding the inferior rectus trapped in and below the orbital floor fracture. The patient's oculocardiac reflex resolved by early next morning, presumably from the tissue escaping from the orbital floor defect.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830832","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.568837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inferior rectus muscle","weight":0.292047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.26538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.145077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Dogma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma"},{"name":"Adventitia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventitia"},{"name":"Oculocardiac reflex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocardiac_reflex"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Trapdoor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"}]}
