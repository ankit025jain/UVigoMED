{"id":88165,"title":"Staged treatment of proximal tibial fracture using external locking compression plate.","abstract":"To share our preliminary clinical success and failure with using an external locking compression plate (LCP) for proximal tibial fractures, further refine the indications for this procedure and review relevant published reports.The current study reports two cases of proximal tibial fracture treated with external LCP as the second stage of a two-stage treatment. One patient was a 59-year-old man with a closed proximal tibial/fibular fracture caused by falling on ice while getting out of his car, and another patient was a 42-year-old male smoker with right comminuted proximal tibia, tibial plateau and proximal fibular fractures. The outcomes were evaluated by radiographs and weight bearing status.In the first case, the fracture healed uneventfully whereas the second case required further open-reduction with internal fixation because correct alignment could not be achieved with an external LCP.Correct alignment of proximal tibial fractures followed by use of an external LCP can achieve favorable outcomes.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890298","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.845287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.605816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.562336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.421461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.28711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.181703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.134583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.102124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Multistage rocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Ice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"}]}
