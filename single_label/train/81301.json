{"id":81301,"title":"Effects of Lactobacillus salivarius-containing tablets on caries risk factors: a randomized open-label clinical trial.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius on caries risk factors.The study was performed in 64 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of L. salivarius-containing tablets on caries risk factors. The participants were divided randomly into four groups, and took tablets containing L. salivarius WB21, L. salivarius TI 2711, Ovalgen® DC (antibody against glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans), or xylitol. Levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, amount of salivary flow, salivary pH, and salivary buffering capacity were assessed before and after taking the tablets. Subsequently, a short-term administration trial using L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets was performed in eight healthy volunteers. The participants took L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets (2.0 × 10(9) colony forming units/day) for 2 weeks, and the numbers of mutans streptococci in saliva were counted.The levels of mutans streptococci seemed to decrease in the L. salivarius WB21, TI 2711, and Ovalgen® DC groups compared to the xylitol group, with no significant differences between the groups. Lactobacilli levels significantly increased in the L. salivarius WB21 and TI 2711 groups compared to the other groups. Concerning salivary flow and salivary pH, no significant differences were observed between the groups. The salivary buffering capacity significantly increased in the L. salivarius TI 2711 group (P = 0.003) and Ovalgen® DC group (P = 0.002) compared to the xylitol group. The short-term administration trial showed that the L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets significantly decreased the number of mutans streptococci (P = 0.039).L. salivarius-containing tablets were suggested to increase resistance to caries risk factors.UMIN000013160 (registration date: February 14, 2014).","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178882","annotations":[{"name":"Xylitol","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Lactic acid bacteria","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.559022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Caries","weight":0.145686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Glucosyltransferase","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucosyltransferase"},{"name":"February 14","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_14"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Texas Instruments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Buffering agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffering_agent"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"The WB Television Network","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network"},{"name":"Colonialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism"}]}
