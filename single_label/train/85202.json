{"id":85202,"title":"Low-normal lung volume correlates with pulmonary hypertension in fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia: computer-aided 3D quantitative analysis of chest CT.","abstract":"We investigated whether the lung volume determined on CT, especially the volume of the normal lung, is correlated with mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with chronic fibrosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP).The subjects were 40 patients with IIP who underwent right heart catheterization (RHC) and chest CT. Thirty-three patients (82.5%) were smokers or former smokers. Using a computer-aided system, the lungs in the 3D CT images were automatically categorized pixel-by-pixel with gaussian histogramnormalized correlations, and the relative volume of each lesion to the CT lung volume was calculated as \"normal(%),\" \"ground-glass opacities(%),\" \"consolidation(%),\" \"emphysema(%),\" and \"fibrosis(%).\" The relationship between each \"volume(%)\" and pulmonary hypertension was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. ROC curves were constructed to assess the predictive value of these CT-based volumes in the identification of pulmonary hypertension.Sixteen patients had pulmonary hypertension at rest (mean PAP > 25 mm Hg on RHC). Emphysema constituted more than 10% of the CT lung volume in 13 patients. On multivariate analysis of each volume(%), normal(%) was significant for detecting pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96; p = 0.02). On ROC analysis, the AUC of normal(%) was 0.849 (0.731-0.967).The relative CT volume of any single lesion was of limited value in predicting pulmonary hypertension in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. In these patients, normal(%), measured by a 3D computer-aided system, was correlated with pulmonary hypertension measured by RHC.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract
