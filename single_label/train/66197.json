{"id":66197,"title":"Resistive intrarenal index: myth or reality?","abstract":"In renal diagnosis, the B-mode ultrasound is used to provide an accurate study of the renal morphology, whereas the colour and power Doppler are of strategic importance in providing qualitative and quantitative information about the renal vasculature, which can also be obtained through the assessment of the resistive index (RI). To date, this is one of the most sensitive parameters in the study of kidney diseases and allows us to quantify the changes in renal plasma flow. If a proper Doppler ultrasound examination is carried out and a critical analysis of the values obtained is performed, the RI measurement at the interlobar artery level has been suggested in the differential diagnosis between nephropathies. The aim of this review is to highlight the pathological conditions in which the study of intrarenal RI provides useful information about the pathophysiology of renal diseases in both the native and the transplanted kidneys.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734937","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.637919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.499824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.321863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.19049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mythology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Renal blood flow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_blood_flow"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Critical thinking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"}]}
