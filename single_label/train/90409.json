{"id":90409,"title":"[Mallet finger: surgery versus splinting].","abstract":"Mallet finger is a very common injury, but there is still much discussion about the best treatment. Mallet finger should be operated on if a fracture is larger than 1/3 of the articular surface or in volar subluxation, because otherwise the fracture may remain unstable or there may be loss of function. However, we believe that most mallet fingers can be treated conservatively. Consideration of the relevant literature from PubMed shows that nearly all cases of mallet finger can be treated conservatively with a splint, without significant differences in function, deformity or pain versus surgical treatment. Although there is no significant difference in complications between splinting and surgery, the complications of an operation may be far more serious. In spite of the current operation indication, we should be more reluctant to operate on mallet finger.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618239","annotations":[{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.693414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.493781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.166114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Hammer","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mallet locomotive","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallet_locomotive"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
