{"id":54623,"title":"Copy number variations of TBK1 in Australian patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.","abstract":"To investigate the presence of TBK1 copy number variations in a large, well-characterized Australian cohort of patients with glaucoma comprising both normal-tension glaucoma and high-tension glaucoma cases.A retrospective cohort study.DNA samples from patients with normal-tension glaucoma and high-tension glaucoma and unaffected controls were screened for TBK1 copy number variations using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Samples with additional copies of the TBK1 gene were further tested using custom comparative genomic hybridization arrays.Four out of 334 normal-tension glaucoma cases (1.2%) were found to carry TBK1 copy number variations using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. One extra dose of the TBK1 gene (duplication) was detected in 3 normal-tension glaucoma patients, while 2 extra doses of the gene (triplication) were detected in a fourth normal-tension glaucoma patient. The results were further confirmed by custom comparative genomic hybridization arrays. Further, the TBK1 copy number variation segregated with normal-tension glaucoma in the family members of the probands, showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. No TBK1 copy number variations were detected in 1045 Australian patients with high-tension glaucoma or in 254 unaffected controls.We report the presence of TBK1 copy number variations in our Australian normal-tension glaucoma cohort, including the first example of more than 1 extra copy of this gene in glaucoma patients (gene triplication). These results confirm TBK1 to be an important cause of normal-tension glaucoma, but do not suggest common involvement in high-tension glaucoma.","date":"2014-12-09","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284765","annotations":[{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.815556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.814798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.570618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.311485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.230405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0891297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"TANK-binding kinase 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TANK-binding_kinase_1"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"1045","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1045"},{"name":"Reduplication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
