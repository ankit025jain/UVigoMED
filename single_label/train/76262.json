{"id":76262,"title":"Insulin acutely triggers transcription of Slc2a4 gene: participation of the AT-rich, E-box and NFKB-binding sites.","abstract":"The insulin-sensitive glucose transporter protein GLUT4 (solute carrier family 2 member 4 (Slc2a4) gene) plays a key role in glycemic homeostasis. Decreased GLUT4 expression is a current feature in insulin resistant conditions such as diabetes, and the restoration of GLUT4 content improves glycemic control. This study investigated the effect of insulin upon Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression, focusing on the AT-rich element, E-box and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NFKB) site.Rat soleus muscles were incubated during 180 min with insulin, added or not with wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma isoform (PI3K)-inhibitor), ML9 (serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) inhibitor) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF, GLUT4 repressor), and processed for analysis of GLUT4 protein (Western blotting); Slc2a4, myocyte enhancer factor 2a/d (Mef2a/d), hypoxia inducible factor 1a (Hif1a), myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (Nfkb1) messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)); and AT-rich- (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)-binding site), E-box- (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A)- and myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1)-binding site), and NFKB-binding activity (electrophoretic mobility assay).Insulin increased Slc2a4 mRNA expression (140%) and nuclear proteins binding to AT-rich and E-box elements (~90%), all effects were prevented by wortmannin and ML9. Insulin also increased Mef2a/d and Myod1 mRNA expression, suggesting the participation of these transcriptional factors in the Slc2a4 enhancing effect. Conversely, insulin decreased Nfkb1 mRNA expression and protein binding to the NFKB-site (~50%). Furthermore, TNF-induced inhibition of GLUT4 expression (~40%) was prevented by insulin in an NFKB-binding repressing mechanism. GLUT4 protein paralleled the Slc2a4 mRNA regulations.Insulin enhances the Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in the skeletal muscle by activating AT-rich and E-box elements, in a PI3K/AKT-dependent mechanism, and repressing NFKB-site activity as well. These results unravel how post-prandial increase of insulin may guarantee GLUT4 expression, and how the insulin signaling impairment can participate in insulin resistance-induced repression of GLUT4.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
