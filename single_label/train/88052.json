{"id":88052,"title":"[Studying of cytokine dynamics in injured persons with severe burns for estimation of severity and prognosis].","abstract":"Dynamics of a blood serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- alpha), interleukines (IL-1beta, IL-10) in 35 patients, suffering severe burn, and possibility of application of these indices as biomarkers of the severity state and the complications prognosis, were studied. During the investigation there was established, that TNF-alpha concentration on the 8 - 10th and 19 - 21th day after trauma does the best for characterization of a burn total area, while the IL-1beta concentration on the 8 - 10th day after trauma - the deep affections severity and the IL-10 concentration on the 19 - 21th day after trauma - the deep affections severity. Hyperreactivity, caused by enhanced production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-10, witnesses the raised risk of development of the organs complications. And adversely, hypo- and areactivity in extended and deep burns witnesses about enhanced risk of lethality. The blood serum concentration of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-10 is expedient to use as a biomarkers of the patients state severity and for the course prognosis of pathological process.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923123","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.733564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.442459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.256263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
