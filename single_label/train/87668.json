{"id":87668,"title":"A modified lateral canthal approach for the treatment of zygomatic complex fractures.","abstract":"We present a modification of the classic lateral canthal approach by means of which the anatomy of the lateral palpebral edges will remain unscathed, with the incision beginning 2 mm lateral to the external canthus. We have used this technique in 76 patients at 3 major trauma centers in Bogota, Colombia, from January 2006 to January 2012. The approach provided excellent access to the frontozygomatic area, lateral wall of the orbit, and malar body. This method avoids important anatomic structures and offers outstanding cosmetic results, especially in adult patients.
