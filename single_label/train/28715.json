{"id":28715,"title":"Can monitoring consumer requests for opioid-replacement therapy improve access to treatment?","abstract":"This study examined data recorded by one urban publicly funded opioid-replacement therapy clinic (from 2009 to 2011) to identify whether these data could be used to inform the rostering of clinicians more effectively to improve access to treatment.Data analysis incorporated descriptive and inferential methods.There were trends in the times of the year consumers seek opioid-replacement therapy, similarity and differences between gender requests for treatment and variation in consumer wait time on triage.National reporting of opioid-replacement therapy triages would help gain a better understanding of the number of people in need of treatment. If opioid-replacement therapy providers monitored consumer triages, they could roster more effectively, have gender-specific clinicians available, acknowledge and inform consumers of wait time on triage and allow re-orientation of services to lower wait time.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807739","annotations":[{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_National_Reporting"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Public library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"}]}
