{"id":54190,"title":"Strengths-oriented therapeutic conversations for families of children with chronic illnesses: findings from the Landspitali university hospital family nursing implementation project.","abstract":"Psychosocial services have been recommended for families of children with chronic illnesses to assist them in adjusting to the illness experience. However, little is known about the benefit of psychosocial interventions in clinical practice. This study aimed at evaluating the benefits of a two-session family therapeutic conversation intervention (FAM-TCIs) for families of children diagnosed with asthma, cancer, or diabetes. A secondary data analysis was conducted on intervention data from 37 families of children with chronic illnesses. Mothers of the children/teenagers perceived significantly higher family support after the FAM-TCI compared with before; mothers reported significantly higher collaboration and problem-solving abilities on the expressive family functioning scale after the FAM-TCI. However, no significant differences were found on the fathers' perceived family support nor on their expressive family functioning after the FAM-TCI compared with that before the intervention. It is promising that mothers of children with chronic illness perceived the two-session FAM-TCI to be beneficial to them. More attention should be paid to psychosocial interventions for families of children with chronic illnesses.
