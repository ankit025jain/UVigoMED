{"id":76808,"title":"Does impedance measure a functional state of the body fat?","abstract":"The aim was to compare methods of body fat measurement in different BMI groups. An additional aim was to discuss differences reflecting the structural and functional changes of fat tissue. The study group included 130 adult Caucasian women stratified by body mass index (BMI): 18-24.99 (n=30), 25-29.99 (n=26), 30-34.99 (n=33), 35-39.99 (n=30), and BMI>/=40 (n=11). Bioelectrical impedance was performed using Tanita TBF 410 GS, Bodystat 1500, and Omron BF 300. A caliper type Best was also applied. Correspondence of four methods with DEXA was assessed using the Bland-Altman and ANOVA analyses. Measurements by BIA were not significantly different from DEXA up to BMI of 30, but DEXA significantly overestimated in the higher BMI subgroup by all three methods. Caliper measurement significantly underestimated DEXA in all BMI subgroups. BIA methods overestimated DEXA for the obese subjects. Tanita did statistically the best. The Caliper test appeared less preferable than the BIA methods, especially in the higher BMI subgroup. DEXA and Caliper measurements seem to be the best estimate of structural (anatomical) fat quantity. We hypothesize that BIA methods could also measure some other physiopathological conditions like inflammation, hydration or cell infiltration of fat.
