{"id":40368,"title":"Gaviscon Double Action Liquid (antacid & alginate) is more effective than antacid in controlling post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure in GERD patients: a double-blind crossover study.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that Gaviscon Double Action Liquid (a combination alginate-antacid) administered post-prandially co-localises with the acid pocket, the 'reservoir' for post-prandial acid reflux.To compare the effectiveness of Gaviscon Double Action Liquid to an equivalent strength antacid without alginate in controlling post-prandial acid reflux in GERD patients.Fourteen GERD patients undertook two 3.5-h high-resolution manometry/pH-impedance studies during which they ate a standardised meal. In a double-blinded randomised crossover design they then took Gaviscon or CVS brand antacid, each with ~18 mmol/L acid neutralising capacity. The primary outcome was distal oesophageal acid exposure; secondary outcomes were number of reflux events, proximal extent of reflux, nadir pH of the refluxate, mechanism of reflux and reflux symptoms scored with a validated instrument.Ten patients completed the study. Gaviscon studies had significantly less distal oesophageal acid exposure and greater nadir refluxate pH in the 30-150 min post-prandial period than antacid studies. There were no differences in the number of reflux events (acid or weakly acidic) or the number of proximal reflux events (15-17 cm above the LES) with either study medication.Gaviscon Double Action Liquid is more effective than an antacid without alginate in controlling post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure. However, the number and spatial distribution of reflux events within the oesophagus are similar. This suggests that Gaviscon main effectiveness relates to its co-localisation with and displacement/neutralisation of the post-prandial acid pocket, rather than preventing reflux.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041141","annotations":[{"name":"Antacid","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antacid"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.820103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Alginic acid","weight":0.749649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alginic_acid"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.66664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Gaviscon","weight":0.453889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaviscon"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.410173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.261252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.0565641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Concurrent Versions System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Brand","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1517","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1517"},{"name":"Flour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"}]}
