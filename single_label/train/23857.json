{"id":23857,"title":"Immunogenicity, impact on carriage and reactogenicity of 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine in Kenyan children aged 1-4 years: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The impact on carriage and optimal schedule for primary vaccination of older children with 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein-D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) are unknown.600 Kenyan children aged 12-59 months were vaccinated at days 0, 60 and 180 in a double-blind randomized controlled trial according to the following vaccine sequence: Group A: PHiD-CV, PHiD-CV, diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP); Group B: PHiD-CV, DTaP, PHiD-CV; Group C: hepatitis A vaccine (HAV), DTaP, HAV. Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae was measured at five timepoints. In 375 subjects, serotype-specific responses were measured by 22F-inhibition ELISA and opsonophagocytic killing assays (OPA) one month after vaccination.Following one dose of PHiD-CV, >90% of recipients developed IgG?0.35 µg/mL to serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V and 18C and OPA?8 to serotypes 4, 7F, 9V, 18C, 23F. After a second dose >90% of recipients had IgG?0.35 µg/mL to all vaccine serotypes and OPA?8 to all vaccine serotypes except 1 and 6B. At day 180, carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci was 21% in recipients of two doses of PHiD-CV (Group A) compared to 31% in controls (p?=?0.04). Fever after dose 1 was reported by 41% of PHiD-CV recipients compared to 26% of HAV recipients (p<0.001). Other local and systemic adverse experiences were similar between groups.Vaccination of children aged 12-59 months with two doses of PHiD-CV two to six months apart was immunogenic, reduced vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage and was well-tolerated. Administration of PHiD-CV would be expected to provide effective protection against vaccine-type disease.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465570","annotations":[{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"DPT vaccine","weight":0.900255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.858115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Pertussis","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis A vaccine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A_vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Pertussis vaccine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
