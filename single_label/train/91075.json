{"id":91075,"title":"Self-expanding foam for prehospital treatment of severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage: dose finding study.","abstract":"Noncompressible abdominal bleeding is a significant cause of preventable death on the battlefield and in the civilian trauma environment, with no effective therapies available at point of injury. We previously described the development of a percutaneously administered, self-expanding, poly(urea)urethane foam that improved survival in a lethal Grade V hepatic and portal vein injury model in swine. In this study, we hypothesized that survival with foam treatment is dose dependent.A high-grade hepatoportal injury was created in a closed abdominal cavity, resulting in massive noncompressible hemorrhage. After injury, the animals were divided into five groups. The control group (n = 12) was treated only with fluid resuscitation, and four polymer groups received different dose volumes (Group 1, n = 6, 64 mL; Group 2, n = 6, 85 mL; Group 3, n = 18, 100 mL; and Group 4, n = 10, 120 mL) in addition to fluids. Ten minutes after injury, the foam was percutaneously administered, and animals were monitored for 3 hours.Survival with hepatoportal injury was highest in Group 4 (90%) and decreased in a dose-dependent fashion (Group 3, 72%; Group 2, 33%; Group 1, 17%). All polymer groups survived significantly longer than the controls (8.3%). Hemorrhage rate was reduced in all groups but lowest in Group 4 versus the control group (0.34 [0.052] vs. 3.0 [1.3] mL/kg/min, p < 0.001). Increasing foam dose volume was associated with increased peak intra-abdominal pressure (88.2 [38.9] in Group 4 vs. 9.5 [3.2] in the controls, p < 0.0001) and increased incidence of focal bowel injuries.The self-expanding foam significantly improves survival in a dose-dependent fashion in an otherwise lethal injury. Higher doses are associated with better survival but resulted in the need for bowel resection.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553527","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.804242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.736754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.694294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.668233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.651895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.620849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.558183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.501589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.350485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Bowel resection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_resection"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Civilian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"}]}
