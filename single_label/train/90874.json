{"id":90874,"title":"Health service and medication use among veterans with persistent postconcussive symptoms.","abstract":"Persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS) are noted when a series of cognitive, emotional, and somatosensory complaints persist for months after a concussion. Clinical management of PPCS can be challenging in the veteran population because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms and co-occurrence with affective disturbances such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. In this study, we compared health service and medication use patterns in a sample of 421 veterans with PPCS with an age-matched cohort of case controls. The results suggest that the veterans with PPCS showed high rates of medical and mental health service utilization during a mean treatment period of 2 years. Although chronic pain commonly co-occurs with PPCS in veterans, service use and medication prescribing trends seem to have been influenced more by the presence of PTSD than chronic pain. Our findings reinforce the overlap among PPCS, PTSD, and chronic pain and demonstrate the complexity inherent in treating these conditions in veterans.
