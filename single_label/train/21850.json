{"id":21850,"title":"Early specification of CD8+ T lymphocyte fates during adaptive immunity revealed by single-cell gene-expression analyses.","abstract":"T lymphocytes responding to microbial infection give rise to effector cells that mediate acute host defense and memory cells that provide long-lived immunity, but the fundamental question of when and how these cells arise remains unresolved. Here we combined single-cell gene-expression analyses with 'machine-learning' approaches to trace the transcriptional 'roadmap' of individual CD8(+) T lymphocytes throughout the course of an immune response in vivo. Gene-expression signatures predictive of eventual fates could be discerned as early as the first T lymphocyte division and may have been influenced by asymmetric partitioning of the receptor for interleukin 2 (IL-2R?) during mitosis. Our findings emphasize the importance of single-cell analyses in understanding fate determination and provide new insights into the specification of divergent lymphocyte fates early during an immune response to microbial infection.
