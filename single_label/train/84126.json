{"id":84126,"title":"[Effectiveness of manual therapy and traction for lumbar disc herniation: a meta-analysis].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of manual therapy and traction for lumbar disc herniation and analyze the current status of this kind of randomized clinical trial (RCT).Database of CNKI, VIP, WANFANG, PubMed and OVID were searched. Some relevant journals were manually retrieved. A total of 2 874 literatures on manual therapy and traction for lumbar disc herniation were collected, of which 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Jadad score scale was used to evaluate the quality,and RevMan5.0 was used for meta-analysis of literatures.The results of the meta-analysis of all trials involved were as followed:the combined effect of the effective rate was RR = 1.10, 95% CI [1.06, 1.14], the combined effect of the cure rate was RR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.21,1.52], the combined effect of the VAS was RR = 1.37, 95% CI [1.28, 1.45], the combined effect of the JOA was RR = 4.75, 95% CI [4.40, 5.09].The overall quality of the current RCT researches about manual therapy for lumbar disc herniation was lower,and did not support the conclusion that manual therapy was more effective than traction for lumbar disc herniation.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167673","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Jadad scale","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadad_scale"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.324989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Manual therapy","weight":0.232246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_therapy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"874","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/874"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_Preservation_Act_of_1970"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Very Important Person","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
