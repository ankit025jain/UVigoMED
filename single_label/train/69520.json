{"id":69520,"title":"Sex differences in the human peripheral blood transcriptome.","abstract":"Genomes of men and women differ in only a limited number of genes located on the sex chromosomes, whereas the transcriptome is far more sex-specific. Identification of sex-biased gene expression will contribute to understanding the molecular basis of sex-differences in complex traits and common diseases.Sex differences in the human peripheral blood transcriptome were characterized using microarrays in 5,241 subjects, accounting for menopause status and hormonal contraceptive use. Sex-specific expression was observed for 582 autosomal genes, of which 57.7% was upregulated in women (female-biased genes). Female-biased genes were enriched for several immune system GO categories, genes linked to rheumatoid arthritis (16%) and genes regulated by estrogen (18%). Male-biased genes were enriched for genes linked to renal cancer (9%). Sex-differences in gene expression were smaller in postmenopausal women, larger in women using hormonal contraceptives and not caused by sex-specific eQTLs, confirming the role of estrogen in regulating sex-biased genes.This study indicates that sex-bias in gene expression is extensive and may underlie sex-differences in the prevalence of common diseases.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438232","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.882576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sex-determination system","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Hormonal contraception","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_contraception"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.627993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.486846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.447966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.292047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"}]}
