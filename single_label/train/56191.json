{"id":56191,"title":"Complement factor I polymorphism is not associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in a chinese population.","abstract":"To identify the associations of the two complement factor I (CFI) polymorphisms rs10033900 and rs2285714 with risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in a Chinese case-control study.A total of 900 subjects - 300 controls, 300 cases with nAMD and 300 cases with PCV - were included in the present study. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes. The allelic variants of rs10033900 and rs2285714 were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The differences in allele distribution between the cases and controls were tested by a ?(2) test with age and gender adjusted for by logistic regression analysis. We also performed a meta-analysis of the case-control studies of rs10033900 and rs2285714 based on the currently available evidence from the literature. The meta-analysis was conducted via an inverse-variance, fixed-effects model, as previously described.No statistically significant association was observed between the two polymorphisms of CFI and AMD risk, including nAMD, PCV and combined AMD (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). By meta-analysis, we detected significant associations between both of the SNPs and late AMD, which is consistent with previous results (odds ratio, OR, rs10033900 = 0.814, p rs10033900 < 0.001; OR rs2285714 = 1.221, p rs2285714 < 0.001). For rs2285714, the results of the meta-analysis were less reliable due to its heterogeneity.In our case-control study, neither of the two SNPs most studied (rs10033900 or rs2285714) in the CFI gene was a risk factor for developing nAMD or PCV in a Chinese population. Additional large, comprehensive and well-designed association studies are needed to better understand the role of ethnicity and other gene interactions in the association between the CFI gene and AMD.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye
