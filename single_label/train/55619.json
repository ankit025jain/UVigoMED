{"id":55619,"title":"Comparison of diagnostic tests in distinct well-defined conditions related to dry eye disease.","abstract":"This study compares signs, symptoms and predictive tools used to diagnose dry eye disease (DED) and ocular surface disorders in six systemic well-defined and non-overlapping diseases. It is well known that these tests are problematic because of a lack of agreement between them in identifying these conditions. Accordingly, we provide here a comparative clinical profile analysis of these different diseases.A spontaneous and continuous sample of patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS) (n=27), graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) (n=28), Graves orbitopathy (n=28), facial palsy (n=8), diabetes mellitus without proliferative retinopathy (n=14) and glaucoma who chronically received topical drugs preserved with benzalkonium chloride (n=20) were enrolled. Evaluation consisted of a comprehensive protocol encompassing: (1) structured questionnaire - Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI); (2) tear osmolarity (TearLab Osmolarity System - Ocusense); (3) tear film break-up time (TBUT); (4) fluorescein and lissamine green staining; (5) Schirmer test and (6) severity grading.One hundred and twenty five patients (aged 48.8 years-old ± 14.1, male:female ratio=0.4) were enrolled in the study, along with 24 age and gender matched controls. Higher scores on DED tests were obtained in Sjögren Syndrome (P<0.05), except for tear film osmolarity that was higher in diabetics (P<0.001) and fluorescein staining, that was higher in facial palsy (P<0.001). TFBUT and OSDI correlated better with other tests. The best combination of diagnostic tests for DED was OSDI, TBUT and Schirmer test (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95% and accuracy 99.3%).DED diagnostic test results present a broad range of variability among different conditions. Vital stainings and TBUT correlated best with one another whereas the best test combination to detect DED was: OSDI/TBUT/Schirmer.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Eye
