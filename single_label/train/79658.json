{"id":79658,"title":"[Longitudinal observations on effect of schistosomiasis control in Gongan County, Hubei Province].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of schistosomiasis control in Gongan County, Hubei Province by longitudinal observations so as to provide the evidence for formulating the schistosomiasis control strategy in lake and marshland regions.The schistosomiasis epidemic data in Gongan County from 2000-2013 were collected by the retrospective research method, and analyzed about the changing tendency of human and cattle infection rates, and Oncomelania hupensis snail situation.The tendency of schistosomiasis epidemic situation was descended from 2000 to 2013. The human infection rate declined from 12.62% in 2000 to 0.69% in 2013. The decline scope of human infection rate was 24.1% in the first stage, 64.4% in the second stage, and 73.0% in the third stage. Eight acute schistosomiasis cases were reported in the first stage, 15 cases in the second stage, and none in the third stage. The cattle infection rate declined from 6.50% in 2000 to 0.30% in 2013. The rise scope of cattle infection rate was 74.2% in the first stage, but the decline scope was 75.0% in the second stage and 87.6% in the third stage. All the cattle were disposal at the end of 2013. The infection rate of snails, area with infected snails, and average density of living snails in the first stage increased by 18.1%, 46.0% and 7.6%, respectively. The 3 indexes above-mentioned in the second stage decreased by 76.8%, 97.8% and 37.9%, respectively. In the third stage, the infection rate of snails and area with infected snails decreased by both 100%, but the average density of living snails increased by 2.7%. The infected snails were found from 2000 to 2011, but none in 2012 and 2013. The infection rate of snails and area with infected snails dropped yearly, the infection rate of snails declined from 0.0007% in 2000 to 0.0002% in 2011, and the area with infected snails declined from 267.8 hm2 in 2000 to 6.37 hm2 in 2011.After the implementation of the integrated schistosomiasis prevention and control strategy with the emphasis on infectious source control, the human and cattle schistosome infection rates decline significantly. Hereafter, it is necessary to prevent the schistosomiasis epidemic outbreak or rebound.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051834","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.779985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lake","weight":0.542674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.403723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.399321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.316561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.272868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.172547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Marsh","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0585896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Revision control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"267","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/267"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Multistage rocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"},{"name":"Telescopic sight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopic_sight"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Rebound (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hereafter (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereafter_(film)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
