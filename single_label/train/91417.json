{"id":91417,"title":"Increased incidence of adrenal gland injury in blunt abdominal trauma: a computed tomography-based study from Pakistan.","abstract":"To determine the frequency of adrenal injuries in patients presenting with blunt abdominal trauma by computed tomography (CT).During a 6 month period from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011, 82 emergency CT examinations were performed in the setting of major abdominal trauma and retrospectively reviewed for adrenal gland injuries.A total of 7 patients were identified as having adrenal gland injuries (6 males and 1 female). Two patients had isolated adrenal gland injuries. In the other 5 patients with nonisolated injuries, injuries to the liver (1 case), spleen (1 case), retroperitoneum (2 cases) and mesentery (4 cases) were identified. Overall 24 cases with liver injuries (29%), 11 cases with splenic injuries (13%), 54 cases with mesenteric injuries (65%), 14 cases (17%) with retroperitoneal injuries and 9 cases with renal injuries were identified.Adrenal gland injury is identified in 7 patients (11.7%) out of a total of 82 patients who underwent CT after major abdominal trauma. Most of these cases were nonisolated injuries. Our experience indicates that adrenal injury resulting from trauma is more common than suggested by other reports. The rise in incidence of adrenal injuries could be attributed to the mode of injury.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506920","annotations":[{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.672465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.660287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.573412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.545754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
