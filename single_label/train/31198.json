{"id":31198,"title":"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy in elderly patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.","abstract":"To evaluate the treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes in patients aged 70 and older with locally advanced rectal carcinoma treated with multimodality approach.We retrospectively analysed 20 consecutive elderly patients, with histologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma, staged T3-4, and/or node-positive tumour, who received chemoradiotherapy and proceeded to surgical approach. Performance status score and adult comorbidity evaluation-27 score were calculated, and their influence on treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes was analysed.All patients completed programmed chemoradiotherapy treatment. Gastrointestinal toxicity was the most common acute side effects: proctitis in 70% of patients and diarrhoea in 55%, classified as Grade 3 in 3 patients only. Radiation dermatitis was reported in 7 patients (35%) and it was graded G3 in one patient. There was no haematological toxicity. Eighteen patients out of 20 underwent surgery. Sphincter preservation was assured in 13 patients. Comorbidity index was related to higher severe acute toxicity (P = 0.015) but no influenced treatment outcomes.Treatment tolerance with combined modality is good in elderly patients. Due to age, no dose reduction for radiation therapy and chemotherapy should be considered.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392453","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation dermatitis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_dermatitis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Proctitis","weight":0.713528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.697229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.666424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.647415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.584125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.325848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.235185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
