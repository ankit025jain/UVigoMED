{"id":50656,"title":"Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.","abstract":"Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are hypermetabolic conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis can be difficult because symptoms can mimic many other disease states leading to inaccurate or untimely diagnoses and management. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of thyrotoxicosis, hallmarked by altered sensorium, and, if untreated, is associated with significant mortality. Thyroid storm should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with altered mental status. The emergency medicine physician who can rapidly recognize thyrotoxicosis, identify the precipitating event, appropriately and comprehensively begin medical management, and facilitate disposition will undoubtedly save a life.
