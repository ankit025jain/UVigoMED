{"id":87219,"title":"Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) degrade neurocan in injured spinal cord by secreting matrix metalloproteinase-2 in a rat contusion model.","abstract":"The mechanism by which olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) exert their potential to promote functional recovery after transplantation into spinal cord injury (SCI) tissue is not fully understood, but the relevance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been suggested. We evaluated the expression of MMPs in OECs in vitro and the MMP secretion by OECs transplanted in injured spinal cord in vivo using a rat SCI model. We also evaluated the degradation of neurocan, which is one of the axon-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, using SCI model rats. The in vitro results showed that MMP-2 was the dominant MMP expressed by OECs. The in vivo results revealed that transplanted OECs secreted MMP-2 in injured spinal cord and that the expression of neurocan was significantly decreased by the transplantation of OECs. These results suggest that OECs transplanted into injured spinal cord degraded neurocan by secreting MMP-2.","date":"2015-01-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25597185","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Proteoglycan","weight":0.77955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteoglycan"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chondroitin sulfate","weight":0.679496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondroitin_sulfate"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.462384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.462072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.240731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Neurocan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocan"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Multi-Man Publishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Man_Publishing"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Chondroitin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondroitin"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
