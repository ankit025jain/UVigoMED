In the last three indications the ovarian stimulation is necessary. The couple demographic criteria (age of both partners, lifestyle, duration of infertility) and the results of the infertility evaluation (ovarian reserve, uterus, spermogram-spermocytogram) increase the chances of pregnancy by intrauterine insemination with husband's sperm and reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies.
