{"id":77597,"title":"Firefighters' cardiovascular risk behaviors.","abstract":"Cardiac events are strongly associated with line-of-duty deaths among firefighters. The frequency with which firefighters succumb to cardiovascular events while on duty is well documented. Many firefighters have undiagnosed or undertreated hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, as well as poor dietary habits and marginal physical fitness. Extremely high heart rates while engaged in fire suppression increase the risk for cardiovascular risk within the fire service. Cultural factors such as shift work and crew cohesion create multiple levels of influence on firefighters' decisions about engaging in positive health behaviors. This review highlights the significance of primordial and primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases that is culturally congruent with the fire service.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571052","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.706815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Firefighter","weight":0.206928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Wildfire suppression","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire_suppression"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Fire department","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department"},{"name":"Rowing (sport)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Recklessness (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(psychology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Prehistory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory"}]}
