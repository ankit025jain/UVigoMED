{"id":79652,"title":"[Analysis of schistosomiasis epidemic situation in Xinjiangkou Township, Sonzi City, from 2004 to 2013].","abstract":"To master the status of schistosomiasis transmission in Xinjiangkou Township, Sonzi City, from 2004 to 2013.The data of schistosomiasis epidemic situation were collected and analyzed statistically in Xinjiangkou Township, Sonzi City, from 2004 to 2013.From 2004 to 2013, the areas with Oncomelania hupensis snails were 193.2-185.3 hm2, and the highest density of infected living snails was 0.00070 snail/0.1 m2 in 2007. However, after 2011, no infected living snails were found. The positive rate of blood tests was 9.46% and schistosomiasis infection rate was 7.36% in 2005, and the positive rate of blood tests was 3.27% and schistosomiasis infection rate was 0.57% in 2013. There were 7 cases of acute schistosomiasis in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and there were no acute schistosomiasis patients after 2006. The schistosome infection rate of cattle was 18.27% in 2004, and after 2007, the infection rate decreased below 5%. In 2013, all the cattle were obsoleted.The schistosomiasis transmission has reduced to a low level in Xinjiangkou Township. However, to realize the aim of schistosomiasis transmission controlled, the comprehensive control measures mainly based on infectious source control should still be strengthened.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051846","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.399151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.358743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.119594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Revision control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Master's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree"},{"name":"2180s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2180s"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Township (New Jersey)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township_(New_Jersey)"}]}
