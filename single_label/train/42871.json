{"id":42871,"title":"Hepatic arterial infusion of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin as second-line treatment for locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: preliminary experience.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin as second-line treatment for unresectable locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 12 consecutive patients with unresectable locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with HAI of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) over 30 min) followed by oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) over 2 h), which was repeated every 2 weeks.All patients presented with disease limited to the liver and all had failed at least one line of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. The best tumor responses using RECIST criteria were partial responses in 8 patients and stable disease in 3 patients for at least 3 months; in 1 patient, disease progressed, resulting in a disease control rate of 91% (95% CI 45-100%). The median overall survival and time to progression were 9.1 months (95% CI 4.9-8.1) and 20.3 months (95% CI 13.2-49.7), respectively. Partial responses enabled R0 liver surgery in 2 patients and stereotactic radiation therapy in 3 patients. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia in 2 patients, thrombocytopenia in 2 patients, and oxaliplatin allergy in 2 patients.HAI combining gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed promising efficacy and safety as second-line treatment for locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24821200","annotations":[{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.607633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.426916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
