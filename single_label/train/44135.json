{"id":44135,"title":"Proposal of a new 'resect and discard' strategy using magnifying narrow band imaging: pilot study of diagnostic accuracy.","abstract":"A 'resect and discard' strategy using non-magnifying narrow band imaging (N-NBI) has been proposed for reducing screening colonoscopy costs, but it does not take into consideration advanced histology and magnifying NBI (M-NBI) that can potentially further improve the 'resect and discard' strategy. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of M-NBI for the new 'resect and discard' strategy with consideration for advanced histology.The present study involved 63 patients. For each polyp, optical diagnosis was independently made using N-NBI and M-NBI, a decision (discard or send for pathology) was made based on the M-NBI findings, and histological and optical diagnosis results were compared.Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (95% confidence interval) of M-NBI for lesions with advanced histology were 1.00 (0.36-1.00), 0.92 (0.91-0.92) and 0.92 (0.90-0.92), respectively. Whereas the management of 86% of small polyps could be decided without formal histopathology, lesions with advanced histology were not discarded using M-NBI. The diagnostic accuracy of M-NBI in distinguishing neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions was higher than that of N-NBI.We propose a new resect and discard strategy with advanced histology using M-NBI that is a promising strategy to reduce the costs of histopathology and to minimize the risk of discarding important lesions.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750156","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.521391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.230474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.224824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Independent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film"},{"name":"Magnifying glass","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnifying_glass"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
