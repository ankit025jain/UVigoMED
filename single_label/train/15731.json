{"id":15731,"title":"[Effects of enteral nutrition starting time on digestive function and growth rate in very low birth weight infants].","abstract":"To study the appropriate time of starting enteral nutrition and observe the effects of different enteral nutrition starting times on the digestive function, growth rate, and nosocomial infection rate in very low birth weight infants (VLBWI).All the VLBWI admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between February and December, 2012 were selected. Depending on different times of starting enteral nutrition, these infants were divided into three groups: ? 3 days (n=116), 4-6 days (n=36), and ? 7 days (n=26). The effects of different enteral nutrition starting times on digestive function, growth rate and nosocomial infection rate were analyzed.The ? 3 days group had significantly higher milk intake than the other two groups at one week after birth; the ? 3 days and 4-6 days group had significantly higher milk intake than the ? 7 days group at two and three weeks after birth. The growth rate showed no significant differences between the three groups. The ? 3 days group had a significantly shorter time of central venous catheterization than the other two groups, and the ? 7 days group had a significantly longer time to full enteral feeding than the other two groups. The nosocomial infection rate of the ? 3 days group (13.8%) was significantly lower than that of the ? 7 days group (46.2%).For VLBWI, the time of starting enteral nutrition has no impact on growth rate, but starting enteral nutrition early can promote the development of gastrointestinal function, increase milk intake, shorten the time to full enteral feeding, reduce the time of central venous catheterization, and significantly reduce nosocomial infection rate.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140774","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.734248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.660458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.609037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.44099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.322512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.166752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
