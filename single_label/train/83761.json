{"id":83761,"title":"[Roles of inflammation-related molecules in emotional changes induced by repeated stress].","abstract":"Stress is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Studies using rodent stress models have shown critical roles for inflammation-related molecules in stress-induced behavioral changes. Under chronic mild stress, IL-1beta through IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1RI) in the brain activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, thereby stimulating glucocorticoid release, which in turn decreases motivation to obtain reward. IL-1beta can also suppress proliferation of neural progenitor cells directly through IL-1RI and/or indirectly through glucocorticoid. In repeated social defeat stress, endothelial IL-1RI is involved in stress-induced upregulation of inflammation-related molecules and elevated anxiety. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 and its receptor EP1 mediate elevated anxiety and social avoidance induced by repeated social defeat through attenuating a stress-coping action of the meso-prefrontal dopaminergic pathway. IL-1beta and PGE2 are thought to be released from microglia activated by repeated stress. Whereas the mechanism for stress-induced microglial activation remains elusive, it has been reported that repeated stress induces migration of peripheral macrophages into the brain in a manner dependent on IL-1RI and multiple chemokines, which are also critical for stress-induced elevated anxiety. These findings reveal multiple actions of inflammation-related molecules in the brain and the crosstalk between neurons and microglia as well as that between the brain and the periphery in rodent stress models.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255644","annotations":[{"name":"Microglia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.688395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.624215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.599298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.544701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.523391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.493484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.460654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.238822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.172431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Social defeat","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_defeat"}]}
