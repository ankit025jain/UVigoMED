{"id":91599,"title":"[Cytogenetic investigations of mice marrow cells after isolated chronic exposure to radiation and chemical factors, and combined sequential exposure to these factors].","abstract":"The article presents data on chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells of mice following isolated exposure to gamma-radiation and chemical factor within the existing MPCs for piloted spacecraft, and also combined sequential exposure in the ranges predicted for interplanetary missions. In the event of chronic exposure the relative number of chromosomal aberrations goes up till reaching plateau and is governed strictly by the mathematical dependence on effective residual gamma-dose and effective damage of organism from inhaled chemical factor. Sequential exposure to the radiation and chemical factors within the ranges specified for orbital and remote space missions caused a tangible reduction of the speed of cytogenetic damages reparation in postexposure period which may be interpreted as depletion of the body reserve and compensatory-recovery potential.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490284","annotations":[{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.816008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.725258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.703039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.460076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Spacecraft","weight":0.404307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Space exploration","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Planet","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Minor Planet Circular","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Planet_Circular"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Tangibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangibility"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"},{"name":"Nature reserve","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"}]}
