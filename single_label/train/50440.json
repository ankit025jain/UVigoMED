{"id":50440,"title":"Do practice nurses have the knowledge to provide diabetes self-management education?","abstract":"Practice nurses are ideally positioned to provide key aspects of self-management education to a large majority of people with diabetes within a primary care setting. However, practice nurses have seldom had comprehensive training in this field and consequently their role may have limitations. A study was designed to determine the diabetes related knowledge levels of practice nurses in a regional/rural setting in Australia.A cross-sectional study was undertaken using a questionnaire to identify the knowledge of practice nurses. A convenience sample of PNs (N = 52) was drawn from a Division of General Practice in a regional/rural area of NSW. Data was collected using a 14 item knowledge survey from the National Association of Diabetes Centres.Twenty-nine PNs (55%) responded to the survey; primarily the participants were registered nurses (89.6%), only one had completed a postgraduate qualification in diabetes, although 76% had recently completed one or more short courses in diabetes management. Pathophysiology related knowledge was strong (M = 88%) as was knowledge concerning blood glucose monitoring (87%). Less strong was dietary knowledge (79.5%), although one particular question relating to sources of carbohydrate contributed to the lower score. The weakest knowledge area was medication management, with PNs scoring a mean score of only 54%.These findings suggest that PNs have deficits in the knowledge required for DSME and therefore, this must be addressed through targetting continuing professional development.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787257","annotations":[{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Registered nurse","weight":0.622707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.567928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.386382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Professional development","weight":0.293921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.162394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.152018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.145004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Postgraduate education","weight":0.104122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"New South Wales","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"}]}
