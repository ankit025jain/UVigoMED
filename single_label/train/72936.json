{"id":72936,"title":"The spectrum of somatic mutations in high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia with -7/del(7q).","abstract":"-7/del(7q) occurs in half of myeloid malignancies with adverse-risk cytogenetic features and is associated with poor survival. We identified the spectrum of mutations that co-occur with -7/del(7q) in 40 patients with de novo or therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. -7/del(7q) leukaemias have a distinct mutational profile characterized by low frequencies of alterations in genes encoding transcription factors, cohesin and DNA-methylation-related proteins. In contrast, RAS pathway activating mutations occurred in 50% of cases, a significantly higher frequency than other acute myeloid leukaemias and higher than previously reported. Our data provide guidance for which pathways may be most relevant in the treatment of adverse-risk myeloid leukaemia.
