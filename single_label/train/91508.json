{"id":91508,"title":"Treatment results of bicondylar tibial fractures using hybrid external fixator.","abstract":"Tibial condyle fractures affect knee stability and motion. Treatment of bicondylar type of tibial plateau fracture is a challenging problem. This study aimed at evaluating the application of hybrid external fixators with minimum deformation in these patients and the resulted outcomes. In this descriptive analytical study, 28 patients with bicondylar tibial plateau fractures treated by HEF device were evaluated. The surgeon used a semicircular and one circular wire instead of the one or two loop of conventional HEF device for a better range of motion of the knee joint. Treatment outcomes including quality of walking, union condition, knee range of motion, complications and the final outcome according to the knee score (rusmussen) were checked. Twenty-eight male patients, with the mean age of 40.54 +/- 13.83 years were enrolled in the study. Complications occurred in 8 (28.6%) patients; 7 cases with superficial infection and 1 patient with deep vein thrombosis. All complications were managed medically with no significant consequences left. All the patients were able to walk with no aid except in one case. In 96.4% and 89.3% of the cases, the clinical and radiological outcomes were good to excellent, respectively according to the knee score. In 85.7% of the patients, the knee range of motion was in normal limits. Application of hybrid external fixator using one and half ring instead of one or two fixator rings in treating bicondylar tibial fractures was associated with desired clinical and radiological results.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498816","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.910935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.553431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.441581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.360089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.340173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.303106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.224556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.11264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.0899222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Plasticity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Historic Railway, Frankfurt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Railway,_Frankfurt"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
