{"id":73235,"title":"Survival and contralateral breast cancer in CHEK2 1100delC breast cancer patients: impact of adjuvant chemotherapy.","abstract":"We assessed the sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy in cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) vs non-CHEK2 breast cancer patients by comparing the contralateral breast cancer incidence and distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival between both groups, stratified for adjuvant chemotherapy.One Dutch hereditary non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer patient cohort (n=1220) and two Dutch cohorts unselected for family history (n=1014 and n=2488, respectively) were genotyped for CHEK2 1100delC. Hazard ratios for contralateral breast cancer, distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific death for mutation carriers vs noncarriers were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard method, stratified for adjuvant chemotherapy.The CHEK2 mutation carriers (n=193) had an increased incidence of contralateral breast cancer (multivariate hazard ratio 3.97, 95% confidence interval 2.59-6.07). Distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival were similar in the first 6 years in mutation carriers compared with noncarriers, but diverted as of 6 years after breast cancer diagnosis (multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals 2.65 (1.79-3.93) and 2.05 (1.41-2.99), respectively). No significant interaction between CHEK2 and adjuvant chemotherapy was observed.The CHEK2 1100delC-associated breast cancer is associated with a higher contralateral breast cancer rate as well as worse survival measures beyond 6 years after diagnosis. No differential sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy was observed in CHEK2 patients.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918820","annotations":[{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.64493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.617981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.547152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.540777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.522283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.374307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.27003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.23351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"CHEK-TV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEK-TV"},{"name":"CHEK2","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEK2"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"793","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/793"},{"name":"1014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1014"},{"name":"1220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1220"},{"name":"1100","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1100"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"}]}
