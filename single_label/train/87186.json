{"id":87186,"title":"Acute clearance of human metapneumovirus occurs independently of natural killer cells.","abstract":"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major cause of respiratory disease. The role of NK cells in protection against HMPV is unclear. We show that while HMPV-infected C57BL/6 mice had higher numbers of functional lung NK cells than mock-treated mice, comparing NK cell-depleted and control mice did not reveal differences in lung viral titers, histopathology, cytokine levels, or T cell numbers or function. These data indicate that NK cells are not required for host control of HMPV.
