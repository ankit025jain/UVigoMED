{"id":82820,"title":"Managing local swelling following intratumoral electro-chemo-gene therapy.","abstract":"Delivering genes and other materials directly into the tumor tissue causes specifically localized and powerfully enhanced efficacy of treatments; however, these specific effects can cause rapid, drastic changes in the appearance, texture, and consistency of the tumor. These changes complicate clinical response measurements which can confound the results and render recurring treatments difficult to perform and clinical response measurements nearly impossible to obtain accurately. One of the complicating issues is local swelling. Here, we demonstrate how swelling caused by intratumoral gene treatments can confound the clinical results and impede further treatments, and we demonstrate an easy technique to help overcome this potential hurdle.
