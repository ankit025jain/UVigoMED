{"id":63557,"title":"Sex chromosome loss may represent a disease-associated clonal population in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","abstract":"Whether sex chromosome loss (SCL) is an age-related phenomenon or a cytogenetic marker of hematological disease is unclear. To address this issue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we investigated 20 cases with X or Y chromosome loss detected by conventional cytogenetics (CC). The frequency of SCL was low in CLL (2.3%). It was the sole abnormality, as detected by CC, in 10/20 (50%) patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses confirmed SCL in all patients tested, present in 5-88% of cells (median: 68%). Deletions of 13q were observed by FISH in 16/20 (80%) patients. Compared with CLL without SCL, SCL was significantly associated with 13q deletion, especially when bi-allelic (P = 0.04). Co-hybridization analyses showed that SCL could be a concomitant, primary or secondary change, or be present in an independent clone. FISH analyses were performed on blood sub-populations isolated by Ficoll or flow cytometry. Comparing mononuclear cells (including CLL cells) and polynuclear cells separated by Ficoll, a maximum of 2% of polynuclear cells were found with SCL, whereas mononuclear cells exhibited a significantly higher loss frequency (range: 6-87%) (P = 0.03). Comparing B-cells (including CLL cells) and T-cells sorted by flow cytometry, the proportion of B-CD19+ cells with SCL was significantly higher (range: 88-96%) than that observed in T-CD3+ cells (range: 2-6%) (P = 0.008). We conclude that SCL has to be considered as a clonal aberration in CLL that may participate in the oncogenic process.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424752","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Sex-determination system","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.794642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.72117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.684215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.605816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.531197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.405407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.248227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.162605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0303278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Clone (cell biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
