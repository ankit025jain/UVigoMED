{"id":65243,"title":"[The Japanese version of the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index].","abstract":"The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) is the standard questionnaire that determines the degree of symptoms and efficacy of treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Because there was no officially approved Japanese version of the NIH-CPSI, the Japanese Urological Association (JUA) formed a committee to develop one chaired by Dr. Masayuki Takeda, who also chairs the special field of voiding function and neurourology in the JUA. Consequently, the committee produced a Japanese version, referring to previous proposals and the Japanese version of the International Prostate Symptom Score. The committee strongly expects that the Japanese version of the NIH-CPSI will be taken full advantage of in future clinical research.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908819","annotations":[{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.795537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.666255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.616645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.546934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.183005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Takeda Pharmaceutical Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_Pharmaceutical_Company"},{"name":"Sanada Masayuki","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanada_Masayuki"},{"name":"Chairman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"The National (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(band)"}]}
