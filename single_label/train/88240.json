{"id":88240,"title":"Local access to care programs increase trauma patient follow-up compliance.","abstract":"Inadequate follow-up of uninsured trauma patients after discharge remains a major challenge for trauma programs. Local access to care programs (LACPs) have been developed to improve access to health care to the uninsured. We hypothesized that enrollment in LACP would improve postdischarge follow-up of uninsured trauma patients.Study population consisted of 5,830 uninsured trauma patients from 2006 to 2011, treated at a large urban level-I trauma center. Patients with burn injuries, transfers to another acute-care facility, and those who died or who left against medical advice were excluded. Patients who enrolled in our LACP were compared with those who did not to determine the relationship between enrollment in LACP and postdischarge follow-up, while controlling for injury severity, demographics, and discharge disposition.Patients in LACP were significantly more likely to schedule follow-up appointments after discharge (odds ratio = 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.51 to 2.10) and to comply with them (odds ratio = 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.98 to 2.99). However, 30-day readmission rates were similar in the 2 groups (1.1% vs 1.9%).Enrollment in the LACP was associated with improved postdischarge follow-up but not readmissions.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881019","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.443391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.354493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.272222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.225021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Link Aggregation Control Protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Aggregation_Control_Protocol"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/830"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Against medical advice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_medical_advice"},{"name":"Transfer (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition"}]}
