{"id":63071,"title":"Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH): a new UK register.","abstract":"Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is a rare interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology. We aimed to characterise a UK-wide cohort of patients with PLCH and compare diagnostic and management methods in specialist and non-specialist centres. 106 cases (53 hospitals) identified. Complete data received in 67 cases (53.7% female, age 37.1Â±14.4?years). 96% current or ex-smokers. Treatment; smoking cessation (79%), corticosteroids (30.6%), cytotoxic therapy (26.9%) and lung transplant (6%). Patients at specialist centres received cytotoxic drugs more often (p=0.0001) and survival appeared higher. This dataset indicates a more even gender distribution than previously documented. It suggests variation in clinical management and outcomes achieved dependent on clinical experience.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482091","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Lung transplantation","weight":0.74879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_transplantation"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Interstitial lung disease","weight":0.62491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.559801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.454404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis","weight":0.169978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell_histiocytosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Langerhans cell","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Histiocytosis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytosis"}]}
