{"id":467,"title":"The experiences and attitudes of people affected by leprosy who voluntarily undertake leprosy services in Nepal.","abstract":"This paper is a record of the outcome of a focus group discussion in which 22 leprosy-affected self-help group facilitators related their experiences and attitudes associated with leprosy services which they voluntarily undertake. Enthusiasm to undertake leprosy services was general. The principal rewards for participation in such activities appear to have been social ascendance and self-esteem. Factors cited as being most likely to further motivate voluntary service reflected the perceived importance of personal reputation and the prestige of a clear association with Lalgadh Leprosy Services Centre.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509724","annotations":[{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.678221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.665675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.381649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.183484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Prestige","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestige"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Government of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India"},{"name":"Enthusiasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthusiasm"},{"name":"Ascendency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendency"}]}
