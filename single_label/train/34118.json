{"id":34118,"title":"Stereotactic radiosurgery at a low marginal dose for the treatment of pediatric arteriovenous malformations: obliteration, complications, and functional outcomes.","abstract":"OBJECT.: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established treatment modality for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children, but the optimal treatment parameters and associated treatment-related complications are not fully understood. The authors present their single-institution experience of using SRS, at a relatively low marginal dose, to treat AVMs in children for nearly 20 years; they report angiographic outcomes, posttreatment hemorrhage rates, adverse treatment-related events, and functional outcomes.The authors conducted a retrospective review of 2 cohorts of children (18 years of age or younger) with AVMs treated from 1991 to 1998 and from 2000 to 2010.A total of 80 patients with follow-up data after SRS were identified. Mean age at SRS was 12.7 years, and 56% of patients had hemorrhage at the time of presentation. Median target volume was 3.1 cm(3) (range 0.09-62.3 cm(3)), and median prescription marginal dose used was 17.5 Gy (range 12-20 Gy). Angiograms acquired 3 years after treatment were available for 47% of patients; AVM obliteration was achieved in 52% of patients who received a dose of 18-20 Gy and in 16% who received less than 18 Gy. At 5 years after SRS, the cumulative incidence of hemorrhage was 25% (95% CI 16%-37%). No permanent neurological deficits occurred in patients who did not experience posttreatment hemorrhage. Overall, good functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale Scores 0-2) were observed for 78% of patients; for 66% of patients, functional status improved or remained the same as before treatment.A low marginal dose minimizes SRS-related neurological deficits but leads to low rates of obliteration and high rates of hemorrhage. To maximize AVM obliteration and minimize posttreatment hemorrhage, the authors recommend a prescription marginal dose of 18 Gy or more. In addition, SRS-related symptoms such as headache and seizures should be considered when discussing risks and benefits of SRS for treating AVMs in children.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766309","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.688752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.642683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.616111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.575564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.198926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0499462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Modified Rankin Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Rankin_Scale"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1637","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1637"},{"name":"1820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1820"},{"name":"1220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1220"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"}]}
