{"id":50993,"title":"SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"The kidney plays an important role in glucose homeostasis via its production, utilization, and, most importantly, reabsorption of glucose from glomerular filtrate which is largely mediated via the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 increases urinary glucose excretion and decreases plasma glucose levels in an insulin-independent manner. Agents that inhibit SGLT2 represent a novel class of drugs, which has recently become available for treatment of type 2 diabetes. This article summarizes the rationale for use of these agents and reviews available clinical data on their efficacy, safety, and risks/benefits.
