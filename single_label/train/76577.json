{"id":76577,"title":"A retrospective case series of the lipid effects of switching from omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters to icosapent ethyl in hyperlipidemic patients.","abstract":"Western New York is among the regions with the highest rate of heart disease and stroke in the United States. Multifactorial causes include hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia, and additional therapies may be needed to reduce residual risk that remains even after treatment with statins or other lipid-lowering medications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a switch from omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (OM3EE) to icosapent ethyl (IPE) on lipid profiles in patients with hyperlipidemia.This was a retrospective chart review of patient records extracted from multiple medical practices throughout Western New York (4 locations). Randomly selected patients (N = 15) were eligible if they were aged ? 18 years with diagnosis codes for high triglyceride (TG) levels or hyperlipidemia and were receiving OM3EE. They were switched from OM3EE to IPE, and lipid parameters were measured after ? 2 months.The records of 15 patients were analyzed and lipid measurements were available for 14 patients; 10 were on statins and 4 were on ezetimibe. At ? 2 months after the switch to IPE, 13 patients experienced decreases in total cholesterol (TC) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels; 12 experienced a decrease in TG and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels; and changes in HDL-C levels were varied, with no change in 1 patient, decreases in 9 patients, and increases in 4 patients.The results of this real-world retrospective analysis of 14 patients with hyperlipidemia demonstrated reductions in TG, LDL-C, TC, and non-HDL-C levels, with mixed results in HDL-C levels, after switching from OM3EE to IPE.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977343","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Ezetimibe","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezetimibe"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.797516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.364764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.364358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_eicosapentaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.156525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ethyl group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_group"}]}
