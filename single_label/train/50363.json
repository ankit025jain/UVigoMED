{"id":50363,"title":"The prevalence of polycystic ovary morphology among women attending a new teaching hospital in southern Nigeria.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of polycystic ovary morphology (PCO) among Nigerian women attending for pelvic ultrasound. This was a retrospective study of the ultrasound scan findings of all women who attended for pelvic ultrasound scan at a new teaching hospital in southern Nigeria from the commencement of ultrasound services on 1 March to 31 July 2010. The main indication for the scans was infertility (52.7%), and the commonest finding was fibroid (44.6%). Polycystic ovary morphology was present in 12.2% of the women. On average women with PCO were younger (30.3 v 35.0 years) and more likely to present with amenorrhea (33.3 v 7.6%) than women without PCO, but there was no other statistically significant differences between the two groups. This study suggests that Nigerian women have a low incidence of PCO morphology.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796181","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.793125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.792105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.784746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.699309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.461872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Amenorrhoea","weight":0.435248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenorrhoea"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.373933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.334431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.30561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.29681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.196764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Graduation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation"},{"name":"March 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Southern Nigeria Protectorate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nigeria_Protectorate"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"}]}
