{"id":56164,"title":"Asymmetrical recovery of cone outer segment tips line and foveal displacement after successful macular hole surgery.","abstract":"To determine whether the photoreceptor outer segments recover symmetrically after successful macular hole surgery, and whether the recovery is correlated with the degree of foveal displacement.This was a retrospective, interventional case series. The medical records of 35 patients (n = 35 eyes) with a surgically closed macular hole were reviewed. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to obtain cross-sectional images across the fovea horizontally and vertically. The lengths of cone outer segment tips (COST) line defect in the temporal, nasal, superior, and inferior sectors of the fovea, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and the papillofoveal distance were measured before and at 6 and 12 months after the surgery.The temporal COST line defect was significantly longer than the nasal length defect preoperatively (P = 0.031), at 6 months (P < 0.001), and at 12 months (P = 0.038) postoperatively. The length of the temporal COST line defect was significantly correlated with the BCVA preoperatively (P = 0.014) and at 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.001). The papillofoveal distance was significantly shorter at 6 months (P = 0.029) and 12 months (P = 0.043) postoperatively than at the baseline. The center of the COST line defect was located further temporally from the fovea postoperatively, and the distance was shorter than the nasal foveal displacement at 6 months (158.8 ± 167.0 ?m, P = 0.13) and 12 months (244.8 ± 172.7 ?m, P = 0.008).","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736052","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.755108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.635822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.434465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.3744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.343394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.192716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0629825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COST_-_European_Cooperation_in_Science_and_Technology"},{"name":"244","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/244"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Belt scroll","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_scroll"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
