{"id":30875,"title":"[Clinical characteristics of 5 hospitalized 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) users].","abstract":"A new illegal psychotropic substance appeared in Hungary during the first months of 2011. Acutely hospitalized patients with psychosis disclosed using a new type of designer drug, previously unknown to clinicians. As the new drug became better known, the cases with acute intoxication were often also transported to toxicology departments. In this study we summarize 5 short case studies that demonstrate the heterogeneous symptoms associated with MDPV abuse, and draw attention to the frequently occurring delusions, and the extended risk of intravenous substance use. Present case studies include patients with and without psychiatric history, regular and occasional users, intravenous and other routes of administration. In the short run antipsychotic therapy reduced the symptoms in all cases, but there is no clear therapeutic guideline for the treatment of patients having psychiatric problems associated with these drugs at the present time. The laboratory examination is unresolved as well. Mephedrone, MDPV and recent drugs have drawn attention to the problem of designer drugs again. This article examines the interaction of drug consumption trends and changes in law, apropos of the presented cases. This information can be helpful for the future treatment of MDPV or other designer drug users. Possible research and therapeutic implications are also discussed.
