{"id":83250,"title":"Anti-tumor activity of grape juice concentrate in the rat tongue two-stage initiation-promotion protocol induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of grape juice concentrate following medium-term oral carcinogenesis assay induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO). A total of 30 male Wistar rats were distributed into five groups, as follows (n?=?6 per group): Group 1 - negative control group (non-treated group); Group 2 - received grape juice concentrate at 1% dose by gavage for eight consecutive weeks; Group 3 - received 4NQO for 8 weeks at 20?ppm dose in drinking water daily; Group 4 - received 4NQO at 20?ppm dose during 8 weeks in drinking water and treated with grape juice concentrate at 1% dose orally by gavage for first 4 weeks after 4-NQO administration; Group 5 - received 4NQO at 20?ppm dose for 8 weeks in drinking water and treated with grape juice concentrate at 1% dose orally by gavage between the 5th and 8th weeks daily. Histopathological analysis revealed a decrease in hyperplasic and dysplastic lesions in Group 4. Groups 4 and 5 showed decreased COX-2 and TNF-alpha and eNOS gene expression. Grape juice concentrate also increased SOD Cu/Zn and catalase expression. However, Ki-67 immunoexpression was reduced at the promotion step of oral carcinogenesis (G5). Taken together, our results demonstrate that grape juice concentrate modulates rat tongue carcinogenesis as a result of anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidant activity and down-regulation of oral cells proliferation.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401099","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.760106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.612603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.512224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.380418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Juice","weight":0.300212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.224556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Grape","weight":0.213692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.213413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.187497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Grape juice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape_juice"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Wistar rat","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wistar_rat"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Concentrate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrate"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
