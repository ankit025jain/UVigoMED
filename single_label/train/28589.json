{"id":28589,"title":"[Anaphylaxis to blue dyes].","abstract":"In medicine, vital blue dyes are mainly used for the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in oncologic surgery. Perioperative anaphylaxis to blue dyes is a rare but significant complication. Allergic reactions to blue dyes are supposedly IgE-mediated and mainly caused by triarylmethanes (patent blue and isosulfane blue) and less frequently by methylene blue. These substances usually do not feature on the anesthesia record and should not be omitted from the list of suspects having caused the perioperative reaction, in the same manner as latex and chlorhexidine. The diagnosis of hypersensitivity to vital blue dyes can be established by skin test. We illustrate this topic with three clinical cases.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834647","annotations":[{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.759694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.585769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.405063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.337414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.315461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
