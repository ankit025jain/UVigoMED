{"id":84392,"title":"Platelet-rich plasma for androgenetic alopecia: a pilot study.","abstract":"Androgenetic alopecia is a common condition, with severe attendant psychosocial implications, and for which it is difficult to obtain a satisfactory degree of clinical improvement.To explore the possible clinical benefit of injecting platelet-derived growth factors into the scalp of patients using a specific autologous blood concentrate.Two injections of a leukocyte platelet-rich plasma (L-PRP) with the addition of concentrated plasmatic proteins were administered at baseline and after 3 months (single spin at baseline and double-spin centrifugation at 3 months). Macrophotographs were taken at baseline and after 6 months, and 2 independent evaluators rated them using Jaeschke rating of clinical change.Sixty-four consecutive patients were enrolled. Some improvement was seen in all patients by 1 evaluator and in 62 by the other. The mean change in clinical rating was 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-3.5) and 3.9 (95% CI, 3.5-4.3), and the proportion of patients reaching a clinically important difference was 40.6% and 54.7%, according to the 2 evaluators, respectively.Our pilot study may provide preliminary evidence that this treatment may induce some degree of clinical advantage for male- and female-pattern baldness. This may warrant the design of randomized controlled clinical trials to formally test this procedure.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111436","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.601911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.597755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.573938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Baldness","weight":0.560834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldness"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.521083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Centrifugation","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"},{"name":"Androgenic alopecia","weight":0.3412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Spin (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)"}]}
