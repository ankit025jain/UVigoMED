{"id":16204,"title":"[Use of GIS technologies in development of a cadaster of stationary unfavorable by anthrax points in Krasnodar region].","abstract":"Development of a cadaster of stationary unfavorable by anthrax points in Krasnodar region by using GIS technologies.Ageographical information system (GIS) of ESRI program--Arc GIS 10.1 was used for the composition of an electronic cadaster of stationary unfavorable by anthrax points. Topographic basis--electronic maps of Krasnodar region (M 1:200 000).An evaluation of safety by anthrax of Krasnodar region areas bythe amount of stationary unfavorable by anthrax points situated in its territories, by their activity during the 76 year observation period was given. Spatial adjoint analysis of ecological timing of stationary unfavorable by anthrax points to soil and landscape zones in Krasnodar region was carried out.Electronic cadaster of stationary unfavorable by anthrax points in Krasnodar region may serve as a basis for purposeful implementation of prophylaxis measures.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051698","annotations":[{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.774954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Geographic information system","weight":0.681074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Cadastre","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastre"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.386135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.276306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Landscape","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Anthrax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Krasnodar Krai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnodar_Krai"},{"name":"Krasnodar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnodar"},{"name":"Esri","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri"},{"name":"Statics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Territory (country subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"}]}
