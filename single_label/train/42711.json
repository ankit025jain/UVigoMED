{"id":42711,"title":"How I treat sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.","abstract":"Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), previously called veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can be a difficult problem after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The overall incidence has changed since the early days of allogeneic HCT. Prophylaxis and treatment remain important components of supportive care. As the indication and the comorbidities for HCT continue to change, especially with older and more infirm patients, SOS remains an important area for clinicians. I discuss how SOS could be addressed, from prophylaxis to diagnosis and potential therapy.
