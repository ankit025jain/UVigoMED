{"id":68666,"title":"Rituximab vs mycophenolate and vs cyclophosphamide pulses for induction therapy of active lupus nephritis: a clinical observational study.","abstract":"We report the first comparison between rituximab (RTX) and either MMF or CYC pulses in the treatment of active LN.Fifty-four patients with active LN received three methylprednisolone pulses for 3 consecutive days followed by oral prednisone and RTX 1 g at days 3 and 18 (17 patients) or MMF 2-2.5 g/day (17 patients) or six CYC pulses (0.5 g every fortnight) (20 patients). At 4 months MMF, AZA or ciclosporin were associated to prednisone as a consolidation/maintenance therapy in all groups. The outcomes of the three groups were compared at 3 and 12 months.Patients in the RTX group were older, had a longer duration of SLE and LN, had more renal flares, had higher activity and had higher chronicity indexes at renal biopsy than the other two groups. Four patients in each group had acute renal dysfunction and ?50% had nephrotic syndrome. At 3 months, proteinuria was reduced by 50% in 58.8% of patients on RTX, in 64.7% on MMF and in 63.1% on CYC. At 12 months, complete remission was present in 70.6% of patients on RTX, in 52.9% on MMF, and in 65% on CYC. Partial remission was reached in 29.4% on RTX, 41.2% on MMF, and 25% on CYC.RTX seems to be at least as effective as MMF and CYC pulses in inducing remission. Considering that patients treated with RTX had more negative renal prognostic factors, this drug should be considered a viable alternative for the treatment of active LN.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505125","annotations":[{"name":"Lupus nephritis","weight":0.939184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.787344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.758458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.740963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.504678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Renal biopsy","weight":0.465488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_biopsy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.388693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.298854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
