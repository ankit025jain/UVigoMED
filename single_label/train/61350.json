{"id":61350,"title":"Effects of a novel proteasome inhibitor BU-32 on multiple myeloma cells.","abstract":"Proteasome inhibition is associated with substantial antitumor effects in preclinical models of multiple myeloma (MM) as well as in patients. However, results of recent clinical trials to evaluate the effect of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade(Â®), also called PS-341) in MM patients have shown limited activity when used as a single agent. This underscores the need to find new efficacious and less toxic proteasome inhibitors. Recently, carfilzomib was approved for the treatment of refractory/relapsed MM and several new agents have been introduced into the clinic, including marizomib and MLN9708, and trials investigating these second-generation proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated promising results. We have recently synthesized a novel proteasome inhibitor, BU-32, and tested its growth inhibitory effects in different human MM cells including RPMI8226, MM.1S, MM.1R, and U266. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of the novel proteasome inhibitor BU-32 (NSC D750499) using an in vitro MM model. BU-32 exhibits strong cytotoxicity in a panel of MM cell lines--RPMI8226, MM1S, MM1R, and U266. In addition, we demonstrate by proteasome inhibition assay that BU-32 potently inhibits the chymotryptic- and caspase-like activities of the 26S proteasome. We further show from Annexin V-FITC binding studies that BU-32, like Bortezomib, induces apoptosis in a panel of MM cell lines but the effect is more pronounced with BU-32-treated cells. Invasion assay with the MM.1S cell line indicates that BU-32 inhibits the invasiveness of myeloma cells. Results from our studies using real-time PCR array analyses show that BU-32 effectively downregulates an array of angiogenesis and inflammatory markers. Our results suggest that BU-32 might be a potential chemotherapeutic agent with promising antitumor activity for the treatment of MM.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728817","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Proteasome inhibitor","weight":0.358889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.296948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Boston University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
