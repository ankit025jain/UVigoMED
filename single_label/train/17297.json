{"id":17297,"title":"Effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and rotavirus vaccine introduction into the South African public immunisation programme.","abstract":"Immunisation has contributed greatly to the control of vaccine-preventable diseases and therefore to improvements in health and survival, especially among young children, and remains one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions. This remains true for many of the newer, more expensive vaccines. Vaccines against invasive pneumococcal disease and rotavirus infection were introduced into the South African Expanded Programme on Immunization in April 2009. This article describes the rationale for and process of the introduction of these two vaccines, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and rotavirus vaccine. It also aims to evaluate the success of and challenges related to their introduction, in terms of both achieving universal coverage and improving survival and health in South African children.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893498","annotations":[{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.640585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Rotavirus vaccine","weight":0.449757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus_vaccine"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.290674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
