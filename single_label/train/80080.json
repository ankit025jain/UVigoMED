{"id":80080,"title":"[A case of previous infection with schistosomiasis japonica diagnosed holistically on the basis of various clinical examination findings].","abstract":"A 66-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of a high CRP level. CT and MRI revealed cord-like contrast effects along the periphery of the liver, and peripheral portal vein occlusion was suspected. Histopathological analysis revealed fibrotic occlusion and eosinophil and histiocytic infiltration of the portal vein. Taking into account various clinical imaging tests, blood tests, and histopathological tests and of his current clinical history, he was diagnosed with previous infection of schistosomiasis japonica. We believe that this case illustrates the importance of a comprehensive diagnosis; in addition, we implemented real-time virtual sonography and EOB-MRI that provided useful visual information.
