{"id":86440,"title":"Early metabolic response on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography/computed tomography after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced stage III non-small cell lung cancer is correlated with local tumor control and survival.","abstract":"We evaluated the relationship of early metabolic responses on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) performed within one month after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with local tumor control and survival in patients with advanced stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).One hundred and nineteen patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who completed definitive CCRT were included. PET/CT was performed 2-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) reduction ratio of the primary lesion (primary SRR, 80%, p<0.001), gross tumor volume (150 cm(3), p=0.036), and pre-radiotherapy ratio of SUVmax of the metastatic lymph node to that of the primary lesion (60%, p=0.05) were significantly associated with OS in multivariate analysis. The primary SRR was the only statistically significant parameter for local control.Early metabolic response of the primary lesion after CCRT correlated with local control and overall survival in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778069","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.842163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.525705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.438388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.403713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.33035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.276618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.267444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Gear ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_ratio"},{"name":"Split-ring resonator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-ring_resonator"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Centre for Cultural Resources and Training","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Cultural_Resources_and_Training"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
