{"id":45828,"title":"Treatment options for acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"This Review covers the latest developments in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. The Atlanta Classification of acute pancreatitis has been revised, proposing several new terms and abandoning some of the old and confusing terminology. The 2012 Revised Atlanta Classification and the determinant-based classification aim to universally define the different local and systemic complications and predict outcome. The most important differences between these classifications are discussed. Several promising treatment options for the early management of acute pancreatitis have been tested, including the use of enteral nutrition and antibiotics as well as novel therapies such as haemofiltration and protease inhibitors. The results are summarized and the quality of evidence is discussed. Finally, new developments in the management of patients with infected pancreatic necrosis are addressed, including the use of the 'step-up approach' and results of minimally invasive necrosectomy.
