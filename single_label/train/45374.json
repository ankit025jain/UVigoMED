{"id":45374,"title":"Strategies to reduce pancreatic stump complications after open or laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.","abstract":"Fibrin sealants could potentially protect against the occurrence of pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy (DP). Fourteen relevant clinical studies (11 open and 3 laparoscopic DP) were identified using an extensive customized literature search, including 4 randomized controlled trials. Data from the 1 prospective randomized controlled trial with reasonable patient numbers found that fibrin reinforcement of the pancreatic stump suture line in open DP was associated with a significant reduction in fistula rate compared with suturing alone. Three other studies failed to show a significant difference in fistula rate. Two small scale nonrandomized retrospective studies each reported a reduced fistula rate associated with use of fibrin sealant in laparoscopic DP. On the basis of the current studies to evaluate the use of fibrin sealants in open and laparoscopic DP, application of fibrin glue to the pancreatic stump could help to reduce the incidence of troublesome pancreatic fistulas associated with this procedure.
