{"id":46006,"title":"Experimental study on the inhibitory effect of sodium cantharidinate on human hepatoma HepG2 cells.","abstract":"[corrected] Cantharidin, and its derivatives can not only inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, but can also induce tumor cell apoptosis. It shows cantharidin exhibits a wide range of reactivity in anticancer. The objective of this paper was to study the inhibitory effect of sodium cantharidinate on human hepatoma HepG2 cells.MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of HepG2 cells, and immunohisto-chemical method was used to detect the change in VEGF, protein level, and to determine the inhibitory effect of sodium cantharidinate on human hepatoma HepG2 cells.As results, sodium cantharidinate significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner.We conclude that sodium cantharidinate has an inhibitory effect on human hepatoma HepG2 cells.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653566","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.788203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.731501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.672162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.652616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.631501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.610066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Cantharidin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantharidin"},{"name":"Hep G2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep_G2"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
