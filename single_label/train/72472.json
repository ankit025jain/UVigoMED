{"id":72472,"title":"Treatment of children with central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors/pinealoblastomas in the prospective multicentric trial HIT 2000 using hyperfractionated radiation therapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy.","abstract":"The prognosis for children with central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS-PNET) or pinealoblastoma is still unsatisfactory. Here we report the results of patients between 4 and 21 years of age with nonmetastatic CNS-PNET or pinealoblastoma diagnosed from January 2001 to December 2005 and treated in the prospective GPOH-trial P-HIT 2000-AB4.After surgery, children received hyperfractionated radiation therapy (36 Gy to the craniospinal axis, 68 Gy to the tumor region, and 72 Gy to any residual tumor, fractionated at 2 × 1 Gy per day 5 days per week) accompanied by weekly intravenous administration of vincristine and followed by 8 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy (lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine).Twenty-six patients (15 with CNS-PNET; 11 with pinealoblastoma) were included. Median age at diagnosis was 11.5 years old (range, 4.0-20.7 years). Gross total tumor resection was achieved in 6 and partial resection in 16 patients (indistinct, 4 patients). Median follow-up of the 15 surviving patients was 7.0 years (range, 5.2-10.0 years). The combined response rate to postoperative therapy was 17 of 20 (85%). Eleven of 26 patients (42%; 7 of 15 with CNS-PNET; 4 of 11 with pinealoblastoma) showed tumor progression or relapse at a median time of 1.3 years (range, 0.5-1.9 years). Five-year progression-free and overall survival rates (± standard error [SE]) were each 58% (± 10%) for the entire cohort: CNS-PNET was 53% (± 13); pinealoblastoma was 64% (± 15%; P=.524 and P=.627, respectively).Postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy with local dose escalation followed by maintenance chemotherapy was feasible without major acute toxicity. Survival rates are comparable to those of a few other recent studies but superior to those of most other series, including the previous trial, HIT 1991.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969797","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Primitive neuroectodermal tumor","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Lomustine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomustine"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pinealoblastoma","weight":0.632235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinealoblastoma"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neuroectodermal tumor","weight":0.587247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroectodermal_tumor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.546442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.523826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.445723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.441371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.398803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.190265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"}]}
