{"id":82018,"title":"[Retrospective analysis of clinical and pathological factors that influence patient survival in salivary gland cancer - could chemotherapy improve survival ?].","abstract":"The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic factors in salivary gland cancer using a multivariate analysis. In total, 45 consecutive patients who underwent planned radical resection for salivary gland cancer between 1985 and 2010 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the clinical and pathological factors that influence patient survival in salivary gland cancer(tumor location, T and N classification, histological grade, excision margin status, postoperative radiotherapy, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy). The results of the multivariate analysis showed that T classification(odds ratio[OR]: 2.93, 95%confidence interval[CI]: 1.47-5.82), and excision margin status(OR: 4.86, 95% CI: 1.76-13.44)had a significant impact on tumor-free survival time, suggesting that both are important prognostic factors in salivary gland cancer. Moreover, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy showed a tendency to improve tumor free survival time(OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.07-1.11), thereby indicating its potential in improving prognosis in patients with salivary gland cancer.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743197","annotations":[{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.580405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Salivary gland neoplasm","weight":0.532411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland_neoplasm"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.41598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
