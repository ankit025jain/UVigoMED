{"id":63038,"title":"Risk factors predictive of anemia development during telaprevir plus peginterferon/ribavirin therapy in treatment-experienced patients.","abstract":"Anemia is a common adverse event associated with telaprevir-based triple therapy of chronic, genotype 1 hepatitis C. Identification of patients at risk of developing anemia could allow evaluation of suitability for therapy, and aid in determining frequency of anemia monitoring and treatment management.This post-hoc analysis utilized data from the no lead-in telaprevir, peginterferon and ribavirin arm of the REALIZE study. Anemia was defined as a single occurrence of hemoglobin <10 g/dl at any point during treatment. Pre-treatment factors with potential to act as prognostic indicators of anemia including age, sex, BMI, and baseline hemoglobin were analysed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Nomograms (graphical representations of risk factors) were developed to predict the likelihood of developing anemia.Among the 265 patients, 102 (38%) had anemia, with 78/102 (77%) developing anemia on or before week 12. Most patients developed anemia after week 2 and an inverse correlation was found between week 2 hemoglobin and the likelihood of developing anemia. Overall, 60% of patients (60/100) with week 2 hemoglobin <13 g/dl subsequently developed anemia. The multivariate analysis revealed older age (>45 years), lower BMI (?25 mg/m(2)) and baseline hemoglobin (continuous variable) were significantly associated with the probability of developing anemia during telaprevir treatment.These analyses indicate the potential of using predictive risk factors such as low baseline and on-treatment hemoglobin to identify patients at risk of developing anemia on telaprevir-based triple therapy, which may increase the potential for treatment success by careful patient monitoring.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486089","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.469117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.233333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.0628012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.044168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Invertible matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"}]}
