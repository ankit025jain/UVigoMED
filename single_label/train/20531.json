{"id":20531,"title":"Antimicrobial stewardship of ?-lactams in intensive care units.","abstract":"Stewardship of all antimicrobials, including ?-lactam antibiotics, has gained in prominence over the last decade. Appropriate use of these agents has become vitally important; especially in the treatment and management of the critically ill. Opportunities therefore exist to develop innovations to optimise the use of antimicrobials in places like the intensive care unit. The next few years represent an important window in which routine antimicrobial stewardship principles such as surveillance of local ecology, minimising overlap of spectrum of activity and prompt de-escalation upon review of cultures can be integrated with new technologies including improved diagnostic techniques, individualised dosing strategies and computerised decision support. It is important though, that these measures to improve stewardship in the intensive care unit continue to be critically evaluated in the literature.
