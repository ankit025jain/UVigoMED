{"id":77058,"title":"Effect of oat consumption on lipid profiles in hypercholesterolemic adults.","abstract":"Hypercholesterolemia is a strong risk factor in cardiovascular disease. Oat (Avena sativa L.) beta-glucan, the soluble fiber in oat, has been known to reduce blood cholesterol levels considerably. However, the effect of oat soluble fiber in the Thai population is unknown.To determine the effect of oat consumption on serum lipid profiles in Thai hypercholesterolemic adults.The present study was a randomized, crossover design. Twenty-four hypercholesterolemic adults, male and female aged 30-60 years, were randomly assigned into two groups of twelve each. Group 1 consumed 70 g (3 g beta-glucan) of oatmeal daily through the first 4-week intervention, and then switched to 70 g rice porridge (control product) daily for the next 4-week intervention. Group 2 consumed rice porridge first and then oatmeal. Before and after each intervention period, lipid profiles including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of all subjects were measured.Following daily oat consumption, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower than baseline levels and lower than the levels observed with rice consumption. Oat consumption reduced total cholesterol by 5% and LDL-cholesterol by 10% from baseline levels. In addition, mean and percent changes were significantly different from the levels after consuming rice porridge (p < 0.05).Oatmeal reduced serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic Thai adults. Hence, oat consumption is a reasonable recommendation for Thai individuals with hyperlipidemia.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851570","annotations":[{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Oat","weight":0.814271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Dietary fiber","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiber"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.42769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Oatmeal","weight":0.300983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatmeal"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.280516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.226731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Porridge","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porridge"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Alfalfa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Congee","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
