{"id":46424,"title":"Long-term survival of patients with cholangiolocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy.","abstract":"Cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CoCC) has distinct pathological characteristics, and CoCC is considered to originate from hepatic progenitor or stem cells. However, the surgical outcome of CoCC has not been clarified in detail.We retrospectively studied 275 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who underwent hepatectomy between 1990 and 2011. Surgical outcomes were compared between 29 patients with CoCC and 130 patients with mass-forming (MF) type ICC since all patients with CoCC showed MF type on macroscopic findings.The number of patients with chronic liver disease was significantly higher in the CoCC group than in the ICC group. The number of patients with abnormal levels of CA19-9 was significantly lower in the CoCC group than in the ICC group. Portal vein invasion and intrahepatic metastasis were significantly lower in patients with CoCC group than in the ICC group. In the CoCC group, 15 of 28 patients survived for more than 5 years after curative surgery whereas 15 of 102 patients with ICC survived for more than 5 years after curative surgery. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with CoCC (75 %) than in patients with ICC (33 %, p = 0.0005). Multivariate analysis showed CoCC, absence of portal vein invasion or hepatic vein invasion, and absence of intrahepatic metastasis to be significant independent prognostic factors for overall survival in patients with MF-type ICC and CoCC.CoCC is rare, but patients with CoCC had special characteristics with favorable long-term survival due to its less invasive histopathologic characteristics.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633664","annotations":[{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.797493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.771311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.546441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.498671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Portal (video game)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
