{"id":77876,"title":"[Exploring the effectiveness of a health education program on the stimuli frame and on uncertainty in patients with sudden hearing loss].","abstract":"????????????????????????????â€”???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????60???????????28??????32????????????????????????????????????????????????????24?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Uncertainty may limit communication and affect the ability of patients to adapt to their illness. A high level of uncertainty in patients concurrent with sudden hearing loss has been related to poor comprehension of communications and poor illness understanding. Currently, there is no any certain standard information sheet in the clinical setting.This study evaluates the effect of a one-to-one oral instruction strategy combined with an information sheet firstly on the stimuli frame and then on uncertainty in patients suffering from idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.An experimental design was employed and 60 patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n=28) or the control group (n=32). A structured questionnaire that included the stimuli frame of uncertainty and the Mishel uncertainty illness scale was used to collect data. All samples received regular care following admission to the hospital and received the pretest within 24 hours after admission. The experimental group received the one-to-one oral instruction strategy combined with an information sheet immediately after the pretest. All participants completed the posttest three days later.The health education program increased perceived understanding of illness in patients with the sudden hearing loss, and reduced their illness uncertainty. Perceived understanding of illness was negatively related to the level of illness uncertainty. The stimuli frame of uncertainty acted as a mediator between the intervention and the uncertainty. The intervention increased the level of cognition of the stimuli frame of uncertainty and then indirectly lowered the uncertainty level.These findings support the effectiveness of the individual health education strategy with the information sheet in delivering to patients critical information about their condition and treatment. Moreover, this intervention may effectively increase illness cognition and reduce uncertainty in patients with sudden hearing loss. Clinical nurse staffs may use the findings of this study to improve their health education efficacy.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899557","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.81484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.658078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.576937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.495734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.488165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.474015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.388387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.186252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Editor-in-chief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Limit (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Uncertainty reduction theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_reduction_theory"}]}
