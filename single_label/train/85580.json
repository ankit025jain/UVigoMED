{"id":85580,"title":"Health care use and economic burden of patients with diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Korea.","abstract":"The prevalence and economic burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are increasing worldwide. However, little information is available concerning COPD-associated health care use and costs in Korea.To analyse 1) health care use, medical costs and medication use in 2009, and 2) changes in costs and medication use over 5 years (2006-2010).Using the database of the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, COPD patients were identified by searching on both ICD-10 codes and COPD medication. RESULTS A total of 192,496 COPD patients were identified in 2009. Total medical costs per person were US$2803 ± 3865; the average annual number of days of out-patient care and days of hospitalisation were respectively 40 ± 36 and 11 ± 33. Methylxanthine and systemic beta-agonists were the most frequently used drugs. However, the number of prescriptions for long-acting muscarinic antagonist increased rapidly. The total cost of COPD-related medications increased by 33.1% over 5 years.The present study provides new insight into health care use and the economic burden of COPD in Korea. Changing patterns of COPD-related medication use could help inform COPD management policies.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903947","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.93444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.693124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.491364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.426628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.42293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.275505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Xanthine","weight":0.131412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0294124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Muscarinic antagonist","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"}]}
