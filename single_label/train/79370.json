{"id":79370,"title":"Hearing loss: diagnosis and management.","abstract":"Hearing loss may affect all age groups from the newborn to the elderly, impacting speech and language development in children and causing social and vocational problems for adults. Hearing loss can arise from anywhere in the auditory circuit including the external auditory canal, sound conduction mechanism, cochlea, cochlear nerve, and central auditory pathways. Rehabilitation options exist for all types of hearing loss, regardless of cause or location within the auditory system. Awareness of symptoms, signs, and rehabilitative measures aids primary care physicians in early identification and treatment of hearing loss.
