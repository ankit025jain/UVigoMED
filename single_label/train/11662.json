{"id":11662,"title":"Update of enterovirus 71 infection: epidemiology, pathogenesis and vaccine.","abstract":"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a neurotropic human pathogen that is the causative agent of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina and brain stem encephalitis. Recurrent EV71 epidemics of various scales have occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. Several specific cell surface molecules serve as the receptors for EV71. Identification of the receptors is an important step to understand EV71 disease. Cytokines, lymphocytes and monocytes contribute significantly to EV71 pathogenesis. The interaction of EV71 and receptors may be associated with the cytokines immunopathogenesis. Some animal models have been established and aim to explore the pathogenesis of EV71 infections. EV71 antibodies can neutralize or enhance infection at subneutralizing levels. These results are important for EV71 vaccine and therapeutics design. Several clinical trials of human inactivated EV71 vaccine have recently been completed. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent discoveries about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of EV71 and provide insights into human vaccine development.
