{"id":45091,"title":"MGr1-Ag/37LRP induces cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance through FAK/PI3K and MAPK pathway in gastric cancer.","abstract":"It is well known that tumor microenvironment plays a vital role in drug resistance and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR), a form of de novo drug resistance. In our previous study, we reported that MGr1-Ag/37LRP ligation-induced adhesion participated in protecting gastric cancer cells from a number of apoptotic stimuli caused by chemotherapeutic drugs. Further study suggested that MGr1-Ag could prompt CAM-DR through interaction with laminin. However, the MGr1-Ag-initiated intracellular signal transduction pathway is still unknown. In this study, our experimental results showed that gastric cancer MDR cell lines mediated CAM-DR through upregulation of Bcl-2 by MGr1-Ag interaction with laminin. Further study found that, as a receptor of ECM components, MGr1-Ag/37LRP may activate the downstream signal pathway PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK through interaction with phosphorylated FAK. Moreover, the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs could be significantly enhanced by inhibiting MGr1-Ag/37LRP expression through mAbs, siRNA, and antisense oligonucleotide. According to these results, we concluded that the FAK/PI3K and MAPK signal pathway plays an important role in MGr1-Ag-mediated CAM-DR in gastric cancer. MGr1-Ag/37LRP might be a potential effective reversal target to MDR in gastric cancer.
