{"id":4519,"title":"[Effect of acute hypoxia on the mechanical and electrical properties of the isolated skeletal muscles in the last third of chick embryogenesis].","abstract":"The age-related changes of the contractile and electrical responses of the fast (m. tibialis anterior) and slow (m. soleus) isolated skeletal muscles and their changes under acute hypoxia were estimated during the 16-20 days of the chick embryogenesis. For the first time, the contractile and electrical characteristics of these muscles were described in the specified period of embryogenesis. It was shown that the normalized values of the strength of single and tetanic contractile responses m. tibialis anterior significantly exceed these values for m. soleus. It is shown that the normalized values for the strength of the single and tetanic contractile responses in m. tibialis anterior significantly exceed the values for m. soleus. Using the extracellular microelectrodes (loose patch method) on incubation days 16-17, the slow decaying oscillatory excitation waves were registered in the muscle fibers of m. soleus and m. tibialis anterior, and the extracellular action potentials (APs) were registered in 20% of the investigated muscle fibers in m. tibialis anterior. On the developmental day 20 in fast muscles, the amount of muscle fibers, which were able to generate conductive AP, was about 100%, at the same time, it was about 50% in slow fibers. No significant differences in the amplitude-time characteristics of AP between m. soleus and m. tibialis anterior not observed. Under the results obtained, it is assumed that the muscles fast type principally involve in the chicken embryonic motility in normal and during acute hypoxia in the period of incubation from days 16 to 20. To study the mechanisms of change of muscle contractile responses in hypoxia, the influence of caffeine, insulin and ouabain was investigated. Hypoxia caused the decrease of the force of the muscles contractile responses on all studied stages of embryonic development (16-20 days), but did not impact the value of the contracture response caused by caffeine. Proceeding from this, we can conclude that in our conditions, hypoxia does not affect the functional state of the ryanodine receptors. Muscle treated with insulin and ouabain, significantly reduced sensitivity of the contractile responses to the action of hypoxia. It is assumed that membrane Na+, K(+)-ATPase actively particinates in the hypoxic effects.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470896","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Caffeine","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Embryogenesis","weight":0.772623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.62417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.42345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.422407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.316327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.269971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Excitatory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.215722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Tetanus","weight":0.195103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Ouabain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouabain"},{"name":"Soleus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Ryanodine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanodine"},{"name":"Electrical conductor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"}]}
