{"id":10175,"title":"Fipronil-amitraz-S-methoprene-triggered pemphigus foliaceus in 21 dogs: clinical, histological and immunological characteristics.","abstract":"A recently launched topical ectoparasiticide containing fipronil, amitraz and S-methoprene has been associated with the development of an acantholytic pustular dermatitis similar to that of Promeris-triggered pemphigus foliaceus (PF).Our objectives were to describe the clinical, histological and immunological features of this PF-like cutaneous adverse drug reaction.Twenty-one dogs with a probable or definitive diagnosis of PF-like cutaneous adverse drug reaction were identified between May 2012 and February 2013.Histology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence were employed to address the study objectives.Most dogs were middle-aged or older (median, 9 years) and of large size (median, 23 kg). In six dogs (29%), the PF-like lesions remained confined to the site of application, while 15 dogs (71%) exhibited lesions at distant sites. One or two applications of the ectoparasiticide were sufficient to trigger PF-like lesions in seven (33%) and six (29%) dogs, respectively. Systemic signs were reported in nine dogs (43%), all with lesions extending to sites distant from application areas. Tissue-bound antikeratinocyte IgG was detected in the lesional epidermis of eight of 19 (42%) cases by direct immunofluorescence, while serum antikeratinocyte IgG was detected in 10 of 14 (71%) cases by indirect immunofluorescence. Autoantibodies were found to target canine desmocollin-1 in 11 of 14 dogs (79%), but not canine desmoglein-1, by indirect immunofluorescence on transfected cells. These immunological findings were similar in cases with localized and distant disease.This new topical ectoparasiticide containing fipronil, amitraz and S-methoprene is capable of triggering the development of an acantholytic pustular dermatosis that is a clinical, histological and immunological close match for Promeris-triggered PF and naturally occurring autoimmune PF in dogs.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666660","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.898121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Pemphigus","weight":0.706677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigus"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.592442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.537956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.376845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pemphigus foliaceus","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigus_foliaceus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.177191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Desmoglein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmoglein"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Acantholysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acantholysis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"}]}
