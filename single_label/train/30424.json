{"id":30424,"title":"[Oxidative stress in the of alcoholic liver disease].","abstract":"Parameters reflecting oxidative stress (OS) have been studied in 37 patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) during admission to the hospital and 2 weeks after the beginning of therapy. The patients were divided into 3 groups: alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatic insufficiency (the group C with Child-Paquet) and terminal stage patients (they subsequently died). All patients were characterized by a significant increase in plasma products of lipid peroxidation (conjugated diene and malondialdehyde) and decrease of the ceruloplasmin level. The coefficient K OS significantly exceeded normal values both on admission and after the 2-week course of traditional treatment. This suggests an important role of the OS with ALD.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502143","annotations":[{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Alcoholic liver disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Alcoholic hepatitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_hepatitis"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.552076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.412202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
