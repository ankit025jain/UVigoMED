{"id":89756,"title":"Remission of central fever with morphine post traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"After a brain injury, raised temperature may be due to a regulated readjustment in the hypothalamic 'set-point' in response to inflammation. The purpose of this report is to mention possible implications related to temperature and homeostasis of morphine treatment in a patient with brain injury. During the month previous to her hospitalization in our city she was treated for fever with paracetamol and metamizol without results. After 31 days with similar results, we changed to morphine IV considering the possibility of treating pain and fever. This option was successful and afterwards we changed to fentanyl patches, keeping fever absent. After 100 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged to her home.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684128","annotations":[{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.678081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.389263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.340315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Setpoint (control system)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setpoint_(control_system)"}]}
