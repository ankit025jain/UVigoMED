{"id":32035,"title":"Umbilical cord blood NGAL concentration as an early marker of perinatal asphyxia in neonates.","abstract":"Recent reports have revealed increased concentration of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in cardiovascular diseases and after episodes of hypoxia. We hypothesized that elevated plasma NGAL levels could be a result of vascular endothelial injury due to perinatal asphyxia.Ninety-three newborns with a gestational age > or = 37 weeks, of which 32 newborns were asphyxiated (study group), and 61 were healthy children (control group), were enrolled in the study Serum NGAL, lactate and creatinine concentrations, acid-base balance, neutrophil and white blood cell count were measured in the umbilical cord blood.Asphyxiated newborns had a significantly lower pH value (7.0 vs. 7.3, p < 0.001), lower HCO3 (15.8 mmol/L vs. 23.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and higher lactate concentrations (7.5 mmol/L vs. 2.3 mmol/L; p < 0.001), as compared to controls. Neutrophil count (10.3 x 109/L vs. 6.5 x 109/L; p = 0.02) and NGAL concentration (122.5 ng/mL vs. 24.3 ng/ mL p < 0.001) were elevated in asphyxiated newborns as compared to healthy children.The measurement of NGAL in the umbilical blood can be a valuable biomarker of perinatal asphyxia in neonates.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029806","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.813809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.76003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.722734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.720181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.665601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.637919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.374362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.328393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
