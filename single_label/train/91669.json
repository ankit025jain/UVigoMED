{"id":91669,"title":"The outcomes and surgical techniques of the latarjet procedure.","abstract":"To determine the optimal position and orientation of the coracoid bone graft for the Latarjet procedure for recurrent instability in patients with recurrent anterior instability and high degrees of glenoid bone loss.A systematic review of the literature including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed (1980-2012), and Medline (1980-2012) was conducted. The following search teams were used: glenoid bone graft, coracoid transfer, glenoid rim fracture, osseous glenoid defect, and Latarjet. Studies deemed appropriate for inclusion were then analyzed. Study data collected included level of evidence, patient demographic characteristics, preoperative variables, intraoperative findings, technique details, and postoperative recovery and complications where available.The original search provided a total of 344 studies. A total of 334 studies were subsequently excluded because they were on an irrelevant topic, used an arthroscopic technique, or were not published in English or because they were review articles, leaving 10 studies eligible for inclusion. Given the different methods used in each of the studies included in the review, descriptive analysis was performed. The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 months to 14.3 years postoperatively. With the exception of 2 studies, all authors reported on recurrent shoulder instability after Latarjet reconstruction; the rate of recurrent anterior shoulder instability ranged from 0% to 8%. Overall patient satisfaction was listed in 4 studies, each of which reported good to excellent satisfaction rates of more than 90% at final follow-up.As noted in this review, the current literature on Latarjet outcomes consists mostly of retrospective Level IV case series. Although promising outcomes with regard to a low rate of recurrent instability have been seen with these reports, it should be noted that subtle variations in surgical technique, among other factors, may drastically impact the likelihood of glenohumeral degenerative changes arising in these patients.Level IV, systematic review of Level IV studies.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and
