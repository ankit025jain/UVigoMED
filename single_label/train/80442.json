{"id":80442,"title":"Prevalence of head lice in two socio-economically different schools in the center of Izmir City, Turkey.","abstract":"The well-known and common infestation caused by Pediculus humanus capitis is an important public health and a social issue in many communities in the world. The aim of this study was to compare the head louse infestation rate in two schools having pupils from different socio-economic levels in the city center of Izmir.The pupils aged between 6 and 11 years, were screened for the presence of eggs and nymph/adult lice using a fine-tooth head louse comb.A total of 88 and 126 pupils from the schools with low and medium socio-economic level were screened and 24 (27.2%) and 5 (3.96%) of them were found to be positive for head lice, respectively. Overall, the infestation rate among girls was 3.14 times higher than in boys.Head louse infestation is a significant public health problem among primary schools. Increasing the knowledge about pediculosis and self-hygiene would be helpful in successfully reducing head louse infestation in the school setting. School authorities must encourage the parents to look for head lice routinely and a \"school nurse\" system is needed for effective head louse control in the schools.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659699","annotations":[{"name":"Social","weight":0.606572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pediculosis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediculosis"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Louse","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse"},{"name":"Head louse","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_louse"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Izmir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir"},{"name":"Pediculosis capitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediculosis_capitis"},{"name":"Sucking louse","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucking_louse"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"School nursing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nursing"},{"name":"Mediumship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship"},{"name":"Central business district","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district"},{"name":"Comb","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb"},{"name":"Social issues","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issues"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Infestation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
