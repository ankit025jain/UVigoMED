{"id":85769,"title":"In COPD patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation heart rate variability during the T-piece trial is better after pressure support plus PEEP: a pilot physiological study.","abstract":"To evaluate heart rate variability (HRV), hemodynamics, mechanics, dyspnea and blood gases following different mechanical ventilation (MV) settings.No study has evaluated physiological changes during T-piece trials following different MV settings.In 8 COPD patients on prolonged MV we applied in random order two MV settings: i) pressure support (PS) 20 cm H2O + positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 cm H2O (setting-1) and ii) PS 15 cm H2O + PEEP 5 cm H2O (setting-2), each followed by a 30 min T-piece trial.Setting-1 induced greater minute ventilation, tidal volume/inspiratory time and lower pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; setting-2 reduced intrinsic PEEP. Mechanics and hemodynamics data did not differ, but all HRV time domain indices were reduced only after setting-1, suggesting a decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic cardiac modulation.The T-piece trial following setting-2 seems less stressful on neural control of HRV. Future studies on T-piece trials should consider the residual effect of the MV setting.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856229","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.706677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.670131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.621983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.516713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.514448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Parasympathetic nervous system","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pulmonary wedge pressure","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_wedge_pressure"},{"name":"Heart rate variability","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tide","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Respiratory minute volume","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_minute_volume"},{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"}]}
