{"id":63758,"title":"Comparison of the performance of the Cepheid Xpert HemosIL Factor II and Factor V and the ViennaLab FV-PTH-MTHFR StripAssay kits for molecular thrombophilia profiling.","abstract":"To compare the performance of two assays used for the detection of mutations/polymorphisms in the Factor V, Factor II, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genes among patients referred for the management of a thrombotic event.We tested 40 different patient samples using two assays, the ViennaLab FV-PTH-MTHFR StripAssay and the Cepheid Xpert HemosIL.The two assays were 100% concordant in their produced results with no samples failing the testing procedures in both.This is the first report to evaluate the performance of the ViennaLab FV-PTH-MTHFR StripAssay and the Cepheid Xpert HemosIL. Both assays can be introduced to the operation of molecular diagnostic laboratories to cover the referrals from different disciplines, especially in tertiary care centers with emergency departments.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401045","annotations":[{"name":"Patient","weight":0.598141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.406652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.399276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0232177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Concordant coastline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_coastline"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Cepheid variable","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable"},{"name":"Factor V","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
