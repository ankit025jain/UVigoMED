The differentiation of neoplasms occurs in a most successful way under analysis of complex of serological indicators.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335393","annotations":[{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.707437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.618205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.524568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.504371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.353316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"}]}
