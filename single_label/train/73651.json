{"id":73651,"title":"The presentation, treatment and outcome of periosteal chondrosarcoma in the Netherlands.","abstract":"In this case study, we describe the clinical presentation and treatment of 36 patients with periosteal chondrosarcoma collected over a 59-year period by the archive of the Netherlands Committee on Bone Tumours. The demographics, clinical presentation, radiological features, treatment and follow-up are presented with the size, location, the histological grading of the tumour and the survival. We found a slight predominance of men (61%), and a predilection for the distal femur (33%) and proximal humerus (33%). The metaphysis was the most common site (47%) and the most common presentation was with pain (44%). Half the tumours were classified histologically as grade 1. Pulmonary metastases were reported in one patient after an intra-lesional resection. A second patient died from local recurrence and possible pulmonary and skin metastases after an incomplete resection. It is clearly important to make the diagnosis appropriately because an incomplete resection may result in local recurrence and metastatic spread. Staging for metastatic disease is recommended in grade II or III lesions. These patients should be managed with a contrast-enhanced MRI of the tumour and histological confirmation by biopsy, followed by en-bloc excision.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891585","annotations":[{"name":"Metaphysis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Chondrosarcoma","weight":0.814023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrosarcoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.769674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.739281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.610005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.378316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
