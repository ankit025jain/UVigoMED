{"id":12693,"title":"3'-Deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography imaging of thymidine kinase 1 activity after 5-fluorouracil treatment in a mouse tumor model.","abstract":"We aimed to investigate whether 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) can estimate thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) activity after thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a mouse tumor model.Nude mice with HT29 tumors were injected with phosphate-buffered saline or 5-FU (16.7 or 50 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours later, 2-hour dynamic images were acquired after injection of [(18)F]FLT. In another group of mice with HT29 cells, static PET images were obtained 110 min after [(18)F]FLT injection.Kinetic parameters related to [(18)F]FLT retention increased significantly, whereas the de-phosphorylation of [(18)F]FLT monophosphate decreased significantly. The standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of HT29 tumors correlated significantly with the net influx constant and the distribution volume for phosphorylated [(18)F]FLT. There was a significant correlation between the tumor SUVmean and TK1 activity.SUVmean at 110-120 min after [(18)F]FLT, can quantitatively evaluate kinetic parameters and TK1 activity after TS inhibition.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511010","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Thymidine","weight":0.82565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.502772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.484519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.48435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Thymidine kinase","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine_kinase"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.309965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.284057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.275404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thymidine monophosphate","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Thymidylate synthase","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidylate_synthase"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Professional wrestling throws","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Electrostatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Deoxygenation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxygenation"}]}
