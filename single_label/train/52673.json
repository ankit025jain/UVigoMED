{"id":52673,"title":"[Expression of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 in different stages of epithelial ovarian cancer].","abstract":"To investigate the expression of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) in different International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics(FIGO)stages of epithelial ovarian cancer and its relationship with prognosis.Between May 2008 and August 2010, 52 epithelial ovarian cancer patients were selected from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of MACC1 mRNA and protein in the primary lesions of epithelial ovarian cancer patients, the levels of MACC1 in different stage patients were compared, and the relationship between expression of MACC1 and prognosis of ovarian cancer patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis.The relative expression levels of MACC1 mRNA in epithelial ovarian cancer from 1 stage to 4 stage were 0.72±0.01, 0.75±0.01, 0.78±0.01, and 0.81±0.02, respectively (F=51.305, P=0.000). The expression levels of MACC1 protein from 1 stage to 4 stage were 0.71±0.04, 0.73±0.02, 0.76±0.01, and 0.84±0.05, respectively (F=65.142, P=0.000). At the end of the follow-up, the expression of MACC1 protein in recurrence and dead patients of 3-4 stages was obviously higher than that in the patients with stable disease (0.85±0.03 vs.0.74±0.05, F=72.324, P=0.000). Compared to 1-2 stage patients with lower MACC1 expression, the survival time of 3-4 stage patients with higher MACCC1 expression was significantly shorter (?(2)=29.804, P=0.000).Increased expression of MACC1 may indicate poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, MACC1 may be a potential biomarker for advanced ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System
