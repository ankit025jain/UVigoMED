{"id":67337,"title":"Biomarkers in prostate cancer: what's new?","abstract":"This review is intended to provide an overview of the current state of biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa), with a focus on biomarkers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as biomarkers available from Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified clinical laboratories within the last 1-2 years.During the past 2 years, two biomarkers have been approved by the US FDA. These include proPSA as part of the Prostate Health Index (phi) by Beckman Coulter, Inc and PCA3 as Progensa by Gen Probe, Inc. With the advances in genomic and proteomic technologies, several new CLIA-based laboratory-developed tests have become available. Examples are Oncotype DX from Genomics Health, Inc, and Prolaris from Myriad Genetics, Inc. In most cases, these new tests are based on a combination of multiple genomic or proteomic biomarkers.Several new tests, as discussed in this review, have become available during the last 2 years. Although the intended use of most of these tests is to distinguish PCa from benign prostatic conditions with better sensitivity and specificity than prostate-specific antigen, studies have shown that some of them may also be useful in the differentiation of aggressive from nonaggressive forms of PCa.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626128","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.758635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.72046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.716136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Myriad Genetics","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_Genetics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.451722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.423623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.338789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.303259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.231662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Beckman Coulter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckman_Coulter"},{"name":"Myriad (typeface)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_(typeface)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Diane Beckman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Beckman"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Phi","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
