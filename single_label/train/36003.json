{"id":36003,"title":"Biodistribution of adult derived human liver stem cells following intraportal infusion in a 17-year-old patient with glycogenosis type 1A.","abstract":"Current treatment of inherited liver inborn errors of metabolism in children consists in appropriate diet and drugs and, for unstable patients, final orthotopic liver transplantation. Unfortunately, liver transplantation remains not easily available because of organ shortage and imposes inherent risks and lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore alternative treatments are required. Hepatocytes transplantation and its limitations led to consider innovative alternative such as transplantation of adult derived human liver stem cells (ADLHSC). These cells present high proliferative capacity, good resistance to cryopreservation and ability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells displaying mature hepatocyte functions.Biodistribution of ADHLSC had never been assessed after infusion through the portal vein in patients. This information is required to determine the safety of the method.ADHLSC were efficiently labelled with 111-Indium DTPA radiotracer and SPECT imaging was used for the acquisition of whole body imaging to document short term biodistribution of ADHLSC.Following infusion through the portal vein, ADHLSC diffused homogenously throughout the liver and remained strictly within the targeted organ. Images were acquired until 5 days after infusion. At that time, no signal was observed in any other organs except the liver. Urinary excretion of 111-Indium DTPA was also monitored.For the first time, we documented the short term biodistribution of ADHLSC within the liver after infusion through the portal vein.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607438","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.732188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.691792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.640631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.599962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.571178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.391439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Glycogen storage disease","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
