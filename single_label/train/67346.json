{"id":67346,"title":"Allopurinol reduces cardiovascular risks and improves renal function in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients with hyperuricemia.","abstract":"To determine the effect of hyperuricemia and allopurinol therapy on renal functions in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4, we studied 96 patients in stage 3-4 CKD (57% male, age 65.3 ± 12.4 years). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 44.62 ± 14.38 iriL/ min/1.73 m 2 . The study patients were divided into non-allopurinol users (n = 47) and those using allopurinol (n = 49) in the last 12 months. Serum uric acid (UA) and C-reactive protein levels decreased after allopurinol therapy (P = 0.00 and P = 0.04, respectively), but no change was observed in the control group during the study period. In the allopurinol group, the mean GFR increased 3.3 ±1.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, while it decreased 1.3 ± 0.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the control group during the follow-up period (P = 0.04); the patients in the allopurinol group exhibited lower levels of serum potassium, serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and renal resistance index (RRI) (P-values were <0.05). The patients with stable renal functions or GFR change <10% (n = 25) at the end of 12 months had significantly lower LDL and RRI values and more allopurinol users than the group with decreasing GFR (74% vs. 48%, P <0.05). In the regression analysis, UA and RRI were found as independent variables (r 2 = 0.68, P <0.01; r 2 = 0.25, P <0.01) that affected loss of renal function. We conclude that our study suggests a role for allopurinol, an effective agent in lowering serum UA levels, as a reliable therapeutic option in controlling renal progression in pre-dialysis CKD patients.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625997","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Hyperuricemia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperuricemia"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Allopurinol","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopurinol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"}]}
