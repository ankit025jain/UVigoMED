{"id":83812,"title":"[A randomized controlled trial: acclimatization training on the prevention of motion sickness in hot-humid environment].","abstract":"Incidence and severity of motion sickness (MS) in hot-humid environment are extremely high. We tried to know the effect of two-stage training for reducing incidence and severity of ms.Sixty male subjects were divided into experimental group and control group randomly. Subjects in experimental group received: (2) adaptation training including sitting, walking and running in hot lab. After adaptation confirmation based on subjective feeling, rectal temperature, heart rate, blood Pressure, sweat rates and sweat salt concentration, we tested both groups by Coriolis acceleration revolving chair test and recorded Graybiel's score and grading of severity to evaluate whether adaptation training was useful; (2) Anti-dizzy training 3m later of deacclimatization contained revolving chair training for 10 times. Then we did the same test as mentioned above to evaluate effect of anti-dizzy training. RESULST: Graybiel' s score and grading of severity had no difference between two groups through acclimatization training (P > 0.05). While they had difference through anti-dizzy training (P < 0.01).Adaptation training seems useless for reducing incidence and severity of MS in hot-humid environment, but anti-dizzy training is useful.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244801","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.876008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Perspiration","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.63229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.465166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Coriolis effect","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.419377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Motion sickness","weight":0.257246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.141581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Normal human body temperature","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_human_body_temperature"},{"name":"Acclimatization","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Subjectivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivism"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Swivel chair","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swivel_chair"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"}]}
