{"id":61343,"title":"The homozygous VHL(D126N) missense mutation is associated with dramatically elevated erythropoietin levels, consequent polycythemia, and early onset severe pulmonary hypertension.","abstract":"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein is the principal negative regulator of hypoxia sensing mediated by transcription factors. Mutations in exon 3 of the VHL gene lead to Chuvash (VHL(R200W)) and Croatian (VHL(H191D)) polycythemias. Here, we describe an infant of Bangladesh ethnicity with a novel homozygous VHL(D126N) mutation with congenital polycythemia and dramatically elevated erythropoietin (EPO) levels, who developed severe fatal pulmonary hypertension. In contrast to Chuvash polycythemia, erythroid progenitors (BFU-Es) did not reveal a marked EPO hypersensitivity. Further, NF-E2 and RUNX1 transcripts that correlate with BFU-Es EPO hypersensitivity in polycythemic mutations were not elevated.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729484","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Polycythemia","weight":0.853583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.709803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.151262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Chuvash people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuvash_people"},{"name":"Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Hippel-Lindau_tumor_suppressor"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
