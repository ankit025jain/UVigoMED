{"id":69379,"title":"Comparison between short- and long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in hemodialysis patients: target hemoglobin, variability, and outcome.","abstract":"Maintaining target hemoglobin (Hb) with minimal variability is a challenge in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study is to compare the long- and short-acting erythropoietin-stimulating agents such as Aranesp and Eprex in achieving these targets.Randomized, prospective, open-labeled study of 24 weeks includes stable patients on HD >3 months, age >18 years, and on Eprex for >3 months. Patients were randomized into two groups: A-(Aranesp group):HD patients on Eprex Q TIW or BIW were converted to Aranesp Q weekly, by using the conversion factor of 200:1 and those on Eprex Q weekly to Aranesp Q 2 weeks; B-(Eprex group):patients continued on Eprex treatment. Hemoglobin target was set at (105-125 g/l). Primary end points were percentage of patients achieving target Hb, hemoglobin variability, and number of dose changes in each group.This study consisted of 139 HD patients: 72 in the Aranesp and 67 in the Eprex-mean (SD) age 54 (16.2) years, 77 (55 %) males. About 46 % were diabetic. Target Hb achieved in 64.8 % of the Aranesp and 59.7 % in the Eprex (p = 0.006). Hb variability was less frequent in the Aranesp group (p = 0.2). Mean number of dose changes was 1.3 (0.87) in the Aranesp and 1.9 (1.2) in the Eprex (p < 0.001). There was 1 vascular access thrombosis in the Aranesp and 8 in the Eprex (p < 0.001). There was no difference in hospitalization and death number between the 2 groups.Aranesp Q weekly or every 2 weeks is more efficient in achieving target Hb, with less dose changes and minor vascular access complications.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448756","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.812353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.774764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.504527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.373749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Darbepoetin alfa","weight":0.187801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbepoetin_alfa"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Conversion factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_factor"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Body in white","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_in_white"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Maintaining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintaining"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Galician language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language"},{"name":"Target Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
