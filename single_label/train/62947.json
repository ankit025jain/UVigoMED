{"id":62947,"title":"[Report of a case with secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia after therapy for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and review of literature].","abstract":"To explore the characteristics and risk of etoposide-related leukemia in the treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).Clinical characteristics of a case with secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were summarized and 10 cases of secondary leukemia after treatment for HLH from literature were analyzed.The child was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus associated HLH and received HLH-2004 protocol. The cumulative dose of etoposide (VP16) was 3520 mg/m(2). The patient was diagnosed with APL after 28 months of HLH.He achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy of all-trans-retinoic acid and darubicin. Consolidated chemotherapy was continued. There were 10 reports of etoposide-related leukemia after treatment for HLH in the literature.Review of 11 cases treated with VP16, of which cumulative doses were 900-20 500 mg/m(2). The interval period between HLH and secondary leukemia was 24 months. The types of secondary leukemia included 1 case with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 case with myelodysplastic syndrome and 9 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. The abnormalities of chromosome included 3 patients with 11q23, 3 APL patients with t (15, 17).Seven patients survived and 4 died.The latency period of etoposide-related leukemia is short. Acute myeloid leukemia and balanced chromosomal abnormality are common in etoposide-related leukemia. The risk factors for development of secondary leukemia are related to cumulative drug doses of etoposide, treatment schedules and co-administration of other antineoplastic agents.It is appropriate to keep suitable range of the cumulative dose of etoposide in HLH therapy in order to reduce the risk of therapy related leukemia.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495767","annotations":[{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.813485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.261358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
