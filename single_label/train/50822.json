{"id":50822,"title":"MicroRNAs as prognostic markers in ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy among women. Over 70% of women with OC are diagnosed in advanced stages and most of these cases are incurable. Although most patients respond well to primary chemotherapy, tumors become resistant to treatment. Mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells may be associated with mutational events and/or alterations of gene expression through epigenetic events. Although focusing on known genes has already yielded new information, previously unknown non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), also lead insight into the biology of chemoresistance. In this review we summarize the current evidence examining the role of miRNAs as biomarkers of response and survival to therapy in OC. Beside their clinical implications, we also discuss important differences between studies that may have limited their use as clinical biomarkers and suggest new approaches.
