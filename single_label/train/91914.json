{"id":91914,"title":"Does dual-mobility cup geometry affect posterior horizontal dislocation distance?","abstract":"Dual-mobility acetabular cups have been marketed with the purported advantages of reduced dislocation rates and improvements in ROM; however, the relative efficacies of these designs in terms of changing joint stability via ROM and dislocation distance have not been thoroughly evaluated.In custom computer simulation studies, we addressed the following questions: (1) Do variations in component geometry across dual-mobility designs (anatomic, modular, and subhemispheric) affect the posterior horizontal dislocation distances? (2) How do these compare with the measurements obtained with standard hemispheric fixed bearings? (3) What is the effect of head size on posterior horizontal dislocation distances for dual-mobility and standard hemispheric fixed bearings? (4) What are the comparative differences in prosthetic impingement-free ROM between three modern dual-mobility components (anatomic, modular, and subhemispheric), and standard hemispheric fixed bearings?CT scans of an adult pelvis were imported into computer-aided design software to generate a dynamic three-dimensional model of the pelvis. Using this software, computer-aided design models of three dual-mobility designs (anatomic, modular, and subhemispheric) and standard hemispheric fixed bearings were implanted in the pelvic model and the posterior horizontal dislocation distances measured. Hip ROM simulator software was used to compare the prosthetic impingement-free ROMs of dual-mobility bearings with standard hemispheric fixed-bearing designs.Variations in component design had greater effect on posterior horizontal dislocation distance values than increases in head size in a specific design (p < 0.001). Anatomic and modular dual-mobility designs were found to have greater posterior horizontal dislocation distances than the subhemispheric dual-mobility and standard hemispheric fixed-bearing designs (p < 0.001). Increasing head sizes increased posterior horizontal dislocation distances across all designs (p < 0.001). The subhemispheric dual-mobility implant was found to have the greatest prosthetic impingement-free ROM among all prosthetic designs (p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.86).The posterior horizontal dislocation distances differ with the individual component geometries of dual-mobility designs, with the anatomic and modular designs showing higher posterior horizontal dislocation distances compared with subhemispheric dual-mobility and standard hemispheric fixed-bearing designs.Static, three-dimensional computerized simulation studies suggest differences that may influence the risk of dislocation among components with varying geometries, favoring anatomic and modular dual-mobility designs. Clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464508","annotations":[{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.678395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.456219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.414333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.186987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Component-based software engineering","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Distance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Modular programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming"},{"name":"Static (DC Comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Embedded system","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system"}]}
