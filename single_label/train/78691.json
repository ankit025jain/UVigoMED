{"id":78691,"title":"MicroRNA-126 modulates the tumor microenvironment by targeting calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 1 (Camsap1).","abstract":"Plasma miRNAs have been reported as biomarkers for various diseases. In this study, we investigated whether plasma concentrations of miR-126 may be useful as biomarkers for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). We examined the function and mechanism of miR-126 in LSCC by using cell biology and molecular pathology techniques such as western blotting, quantitative PCR, IHC and IF. The expression of Camsap1 mRNA and protein is higher in cancer tissues compared to that in normal tissues. Both miR-126 and Camsap1 were related with the prognosis of LSCC patients. We found that miR-126 was able to inhibit LSCC partly by suppressing Camsap1 expression. In addition, Camsap1 expression induced microtubule formation and aggregation. This mechanism possibly explains why loss of miR-126 is frequently associated with tumor metastasis.
