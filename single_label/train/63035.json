{"id":63035,"title":"The effect of XPD/ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphism on acute leukemia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Epidemiological studies have assessed the association between xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) Lys751Gln and acute leukemia risk with conflicting results. We performed this meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to assess the strength of the association.Ten published case-control studies including a total of 1494 cases and 2259 controls were identified. Overall, significant risk effects of Lys751Gln genotype was found under the dominant model (OR=1.16; 95% CI=1.01-1.34; P=0.032). When stratified by clinical types, the variant genotype was associated with the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risk under the heterozygote comparison (OR=1.20; 95% CI=1.00-1.43; P=0.048), the homozygote comparison (OR=1.35; 95% CI=1.05-1.74; P=0.019) and the dominant model (OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.04-1.45; P=0.015), respectively. Furthermore, significantly increased risks were also pronounced in Caucasian AML patients (the homozygote comparison: OR=1.38; 95% CI=1.07-1.78; P=0.013; the dominant model: OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.03-1.46; P=0.020; and the recessive model: OR=1.26; 95% CI=1.00-1.60; P=0.050). No evident heterogeneities were observed for the overall data under all genetic models. In addition, no statistical evidence for publication bias was found using the method of Begg's and Egger's tests.This meta-analysis suggested that XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism might be a risk factor for AML and Caucasian acute leukemia patients.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
