{"id":45241,"title":"Prognostic markers for immunochemotherapy using tegafur -uracil (UFT) and protein-bound polysaccharide K (PSK).","abstract":"We previously reported that PSK-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis reaction (PSK-stimulation index; PSK-SI) may be a prognostic marker for immunochemotherapy using PSK in gastrointestinal cancer patients. In this study we evaluated the usefulness of PSK-SI as a prognostic marker for PSK therapy at higher and lower serum immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) levels.98 gastric and 135 colorectal cancer patients were analyzed. PSK-SI and serum IAP levels were measured preoperatively. After operation, patients received UFT and PSK for two years.There were no differences between patients with higher and those with lower PSK-SI with respect to the clinicopathological factors. In patients with higher serum IAP levels (> or = 500 microg/ml), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were apparently more favorable in the higher PSK-SI group (gastric cancer; > or = 1.75, colorectal cancer; > or = 2.1) than in lower PSK-SI group, although the differences were not significant.Serum IAP levels and PSK-SI may be useful markers for prediction of response to immunochemotherapy using PSK, although further studies are necessary.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693683","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.869195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Uracil","weight":0.756782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.748578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.724672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal cancer","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.585964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tegafur","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegafur"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Budding","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budding"},{"name":"Polysaccharide-K","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide-K"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Remote File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_File_System"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Tegafur-uracil","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegafur-uracil"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
