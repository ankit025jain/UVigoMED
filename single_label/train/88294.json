{"id":88294,"title":"How safe is titanium elastic nail application in the surgical treatment of tibia fractures in children?","abstract":"Tibia fractures in children are generally treated successfully by conservative means. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixation using Titanium elastic nails (TEN) in pediatric tibia fractures in which conservative measures failed or were deemed inapplicable. In this study, 30 patients who had tibia fractures and were fixated with TEN between 2007 and 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The procedure was performed after poly-trauma in six patients, open fracture in seven, reduction loss in twelve, and unsuccessful closed reduction in five patients. The number of girls and boys was 3 and 27, respectively, with a mean age of 9.8 years. The evaluation criteria of Flynn et al. were used in the analysis of the results. The mean follow-up period was 18 months. The mean period of union was 8 weeks and 14 weeks in closed and open fractures, respectively. Epiphyseal damage, rotational deformity, need for reintervention, deep infection, implant failure, or recurrent fracture was not observed in any case. According to the Flynn evaluation system, 23 cases were evaluated as excellent, and 7 as good. Fixation with TEN is an easy, effective, and safe method that can be used in tibia fractures that are open, irreducible, or with loss of reduction and in cases with accompanying trauma, such as floating knee.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873089","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.827763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.730161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.656369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.290327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0709418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"},{"name":"Clopen set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopen_set"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"TEN (TV station)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEN_(TV_station)"},{"name":"Radial recurrent artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_recurrent_artery"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
