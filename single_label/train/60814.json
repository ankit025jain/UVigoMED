{"id":60814,"title":"The role of inflammatory cells in angiogenesis in multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Both innate and adaptive immune cells are involved in the mechanisms of endothelial cell proliferation, migration and activation, via production and release of a large spectrum of pro-angiogenic mediators, thus creating the specific microenvironment that favors increased rate of tissue vascularization. In this article, we focus on the immune cell component of the angiogenic process occurring during multiple myeloma progression. We also provide information on some anti-angiogenic properties of immune cells that may be applied for a potential pharmacological use as anti-angiogenic agents in the disease treatment.
