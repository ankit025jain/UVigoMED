{"id":90504,"title":"Adjuvant hypofractionated versus conventional whole breast radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer: long-term hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes.","abstract":"The risk of cardiac injury with hypofractionated whole-breast/chest wall radiation therapy (HF-WBI) compared with conventional whole-breast/chest wall radiation therapy (CF-WBI) in women with left-sided breast cancer remains a concern. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an increase in hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes with HF-WBI relative to CF-WBI.Between 1990 and 1998, 5334 women ? 80 years of age with early-stage breast cancer were treated with postoperative radiation therapy to the breast or chest wall alone. A population-based database recorded baseline patient, tumor, and treatment factors. Hospital administrative records identified baseline cardiac risk factors and other comorbidities. Factors between radiation therapy groups were balanced using a propensity-score model. The first event of a hospital admission for cardiac causes after radiation therapy was determined from hospitalization records. Ten- and 15-year cumulative hospital-related cardiac morbidity after radiation therapy was estimated for left- and right-sided cases using a competing risk approach.The median follow-up was 13.2 years. For left-sided cases, 485 women were treated with CF-WBI, and 2221 women were treated with HF-WBI. Mastectomy was more common in the HF-WBI group, whereas boost was more common in the CF-WBI group. The CF-WBI group had a higher prevalence of diabetes. The 15-year cumulative hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes (95% confidence interval) was not different between the 2 radiation therapy regimens after propensity-score adjustment: 21% (19-22) with HF-WBI and 21% (17-25) with CF-WBI (P=.93). For right-sided cases, the 15-year cumulative hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes was also similar between the radiation therapy groups (P=.76).There is no difference in morbidity leading to hospitalization from cardiac causes among women with left-sided early-stage breast cancer treated with HF-WBI or CF-WBI at 15-year follow-up.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606848","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.722496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.674378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.518819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.517294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.423784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.265579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.21542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.153297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.144676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1922","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1922"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
