{"id":61653,"title":"Preclinical and clinical results with pomalidomide in the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Despite the evolution of effective frontline treatment strategies, many patients with myeloma inevitably relapse. Treatment can be complicated by the interplay of disease-, treatment-, and patient-related factors. Unfortunately, many patients eventually develop disease that is refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib and have few treatment options. Pomalidomide is a distinct IMiD agent recently approved in the US and Europe. We review the pomalidomide mechanism of action, summarizing its direct antimyeloma, immunomodulatory, and stromal-support inhibitory activities. We also detail its clinical development, including establishment of the approved dose/schedule, phase 2 and 3 trials in relapsed and refractory patients, and novel pomalidomide-based combinations.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690110","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.513317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.331517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
