{"id":74848,"title":"[Effect of electroacupuncture intervention on autophagy pathway in APP 695 V 717 I transgenic mice].","abstract":"To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) therapy on the intraneuronal Abeta1-42 and dysfunction of autophagy pathway, so as to reveal its mechanism underlying improvement of Alzheimer's disease (AD).APP 695 V 717 I transgenic female mice were randomly divided into model group (n = 6) and EA group (n = 6); and C 57 BL/6 mice were used as the control group (n = 6). After 3 months' treatment by EA therapy at \"Baihui\" (GV 20) and \"Yongquan\" (KI 1) (15 min, once every other day, 2 Hz/100 Hz, 1-2 mA), the expression level of Abeta1-42 of the striate cortex was detected by immunohistochemistry. TUNEL staining was used to detect the degree of apoptosis of the striate cortex, and ultrastructural changes of autophagosome in the cortex were observed using electron microscope.In comparison with the control group, Abeta1-42 expression level and the apoptotic neurons in the striate cortex were significantly up-regulated in the model group (P < 0.01). Following EA intervention for 3 months, the Abeta1-42 expression level and the number of apoptotic neurons were significantly decreased in the EA group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Accordingly, transgenic induced dark degenerated neurons exhibiting irregular body deformation, analosis, and abundant secondary lysosomes and autophagosomes were reduced in the EA group.EA intervention can effectively down-regulate Abeta1-42 expression and number of the apoptotic neurons in the striate cortex in APP transgenic model mice, which may contribute to its effect in improving pathological changes of ultrastructure of neurons.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219121","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.845772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.47189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.453107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.432104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.425887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Beta amyloid","weight":0.414456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_amyloid"},{"name":"Visual cortex","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.28029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Amyloid precursor protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_precursor_protein"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Ampere","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
