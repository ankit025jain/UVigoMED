{"id":83098,"title":"Diet of upper paleolithic modern humans: evidence from microwear texture analysis.","abstract":"This article presents the results of the occlusal molar microwear texture analysis of 32 adult Upper Paleolithic modern humans from a total of 21 European sites dating to marine isotope stages 3 and 2. The occlusal molar microwear textures of these specimens were analyzed with the aim of examining the effects of the climatic, as well as the cultural, changes on the diets of the Upper Paleolithic modern humans. The results of this analysis do not reveal any environmentally driven dietary shifts for the Upper Paleolithic hominins indicating that the climatic and their associated paleoecological changes did not force these humans to significantly alter their diets in order to survive. However, the microwear texture analysis does detect culturally related changes in the Upper Paleolithic humans' diets. Specifically, significant differences in diet were found between the earlier Upper Paleolithic individuals, i.e., those belonging to the Aurignacian and Gravettian contexts, and the later Magdalenian ones, such that the diet of the latter group was more varied and included more abrasive foods compared with those of the former.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449141","annotations":[{"name":"Upper Paleolithic","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Paleolithic","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hominini","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.529162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.462754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Aurignacian","weight":0.449924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurignacian"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.438227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Magdalenian","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalenian"},{"name":"Gravettian","weight":0.375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravettian"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Paleoecology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoecology"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Upper Peninsula of Michigan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan"},{"name":"Texture mapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping"},{"name":"Abrasive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasive"},{"name":"Texture (crystalline)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_(crystalline)"},{"name":"Mouthfeel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
