{"id":55915,"title":"Reduction in mean deviation values in automated perimetry in eyes with multifocal compared to monofocal intraocular lens implants.","abstract":"To evaluate differences in mean deviation values in automated perimetry in healthy eyes with multifocal compared to monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) implants.Prospective, age-matched, comparative analysis.Single-center, tertiary referral academic practice.A total of 37 healthy eyes in 37 patients with bilateral multifocal (n=22) or monofocal (n=15) IOL implants were studied. INTERVENTION/OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: Humphrey Visual Field 10-2 testing was performed on all patients.Mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) numerical values were evaluated and compared between groups.The average MD was -2.84 dB (SD 2.32) for the multifocal IOL group and -0.97 dB (SD 1.58) for the monofocal IOL group (P=.006). There was no significant difference in PSD between the 2 groups (P=.99). Eyes that had the visual field 10-2 testing?6 months from time of IOL placement showed no improvement in MD when compared to eyes that were tested within 6 months from IOL placement.Multifocal IOL implants cause significant nonspecific reduction in MD values on Humphrey Visual Field 10-2 testing that does not improve with time or neuroadaptation. Multifocal IOL implants may be inadvisable in patients where central visual field reduction may not be tolerated, such as macular degeneration, retinal pigment epithelium changes, and glaucoma.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784872","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.676915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.66241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.652379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.584732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.556653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.481816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.408244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.261516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.22293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Absolute deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation"},{"name":"Neural adaptation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gematria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Field (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)"},{"name":"Butterfly Bomb","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Bomb"},{"name":"California's 1st State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_1st_State_Senate_district"}]}
