{"id":38634,"title":"Cohort study of probiotics in a North American neonatal intensive care unit.","abstract":"To determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) without adverse consequences.Since the end of July 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. We give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HA-111 [corrected] (2 Ã— 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. We compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months.Two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. Introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in NEC (from 9.8% to 5.4%, P < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or NEC (from 17% to 10.5%, P < .05). After adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (OR for NEC, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.98; OR for death or NEC, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.93). There was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection.A product that is readily available in North America, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of NEC in our neonatal intensive care unit.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411521","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.775158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.686939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.620697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.52625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.385386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.380998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.370684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.23879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.235017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.211204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Necrotizing enterocolitis","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_enterocolitis"},{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.136923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium","weight":0.118284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0390912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_rhamnosus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
