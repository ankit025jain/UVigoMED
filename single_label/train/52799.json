{"id":52799,"title":"Three-dimensional sonography in the evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism.","abstract":"Three-dimensional sonography is useful in the preoperative evaluation of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. In this pictorial essay, we review the characteristic spectrum of grayscale and Doppler appearances of parathyroid glands on 2-dimensional sonography and demonstrate the additional benefits of 3-dimensional scanning.
