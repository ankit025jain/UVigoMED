{"id":88188,"title":"An association study of CASQ1 gene polymorphisms and heat stroke.","abstract":"Although molecular mechanisms of heat stroke under physiological and pathological conditions have not yet been elucidated, a novel disease-associated gene encoding a calcium-binding protein, calsequestrin-1 (CASQ1), was suggested relevant based on results from a transgenic murine model. Here, we show the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CASQ1 and physiological parameters for heat stroke from a study involving 150 patients. Pooled DNA from heat stroke patients were subjected to sequencing and 3 SNPs were identified. Genotypes were assigned for all patients according to g. 175A>G, one SNP which leads to a nonsynonymous substitution (N59D) in the first exon of human CASQ1 gene. We analyzed the genotypic data with a linear model based on significance scores between SNP (175A>G) and heat stroke parameters. As a result, we found a significant association between SNP A175G and heat stroke (P<0.05). Further bioinformatics analysis of the 1-Mb flanking sequence revealed the presence of two genes that encode DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 (DCAF8), and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19 (PEX19), respectively, which might be functionally related to CASQ1. Our results showed that the blood calcium of patients with allele D increased significantly, compared to patients with allele N (P<0.05), which may result from the decreased calcium in muscle, suggesting that N59D in CASQ1 might account for the dysfunction of CASQ1 in calcium regulation during heat stroke.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887214","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.879114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.755825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.680307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.665761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Abiogenesis","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.26504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.259432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.247671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Megabase","weight":0.140765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabase"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.026953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
