{"id":83848,"title":"The Nocturia Impact Diary: a self-reported impact measure to complement the voiding diary.","abstract":"Nocturia is a chronic, fluctuating disease that disrupts sleep and has a wide-ranging impact on quality of life. Valid tools to measure the patient-reported impact of nocturia are essential for evaluating the value of treatment, but the available tools are suboptimal.This study reports the development and validation of the Nocturia Impact Diary-an augmented form of the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire designed to be completed in conjunction with the widely used 3-day voiding diary.The process comprised three steps: Step 1: Development of a concept pool using the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire and data from relevant studies; Step 2: Content validity study; Step 3: Psychometric testing of construct validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the diary in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with nocturia.Step 1: Fourteen items and 4 domains were included in the first draft of the diary. Step 2: Twenty-three patients with nocturia participated in the cognitive debriefing study. Items were adjusted accordingly, and the content validity was high. Step 3: Fifty-six patients were randomized to desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet or placebo. The diary demonstrated high construct validity, with good sensitivity and a good fit to Rasch model, as well as high internal consistency, discriminatory ability, and acceptable sensitivity to change. Results indicated that the diary was unidimensional.The Nocturia Impact Diary is a convenient, validated patient-reported outcome measure. It should be used in conjunction with a voiding diary to capture the real-life consequences of nocturia and its treatment.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236993","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.810373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Rasch model","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasch_model"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.628391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.58236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.555586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Content validity","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_validity"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.340249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Desmopressin","weight":0.282223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmopressin"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Nocturia","weight":0.233635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturia"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Orally disintegrating tablet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orally_disintegrating_tablet"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0275312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Pool (cue sports)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(cue_sports)"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"USMLE Step 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USMLE_Step_1"},{"name":"Debriefing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debriefing"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"}]}
