{"id":50534,"title":"Anti-PD1 following ipilimumab for mucosal melanoma: durable tumor response associated with severe hypothyroidism and rhabdomyolysis.","abstract":"Treatment with fully human monoclonal antibodies against programmed death 1 (PD1) receptor has shown great promise for a number of advanced malignancies. Although inflammatory adverse events have been well described with anti-CTL antigen 4 (CTLA4) therapy, experience with the range of adverse effects of anti-PD1 remains comparatively limited. Here, we report on a patient with advanced mucosal melanoma who received four doses of MK-3475, a fully human monoclonal antibody against PD1, and experienced a durable near-complete response but developed severe hypothyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported of a patient with advanced mucosal melanoma who responded to anti-PD1 therapy. With the promising antitumor effects of anti-PD1 in a wide array of tumors, we expect an increasing number of patients to be exposed to anti-PD1 therapies. Recognition of infrequent presentations of adverse events such as elevated creatine kinase levels and thyroid disorders in patients who receive anti-PD1 therapy is important.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778161","annotations":[{"name":"Rhabdomyolysis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.657939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.598791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.543164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ipilimumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipilimumab"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"}]}
