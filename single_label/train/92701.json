{"id":92701,"title":"Three cases of perioral dermatitis related to fusobacteria treated with ?-lactam antibiotics.","abstract":"The oral tetracyclines, especially minocycline hydrochloride, are often used as an effective treatment for perioral dermatitis; however, they are sometimes difficult to use, especially in children, because of the side effects.The effectiveness of ?-lactam antibiotics was evaluated in three cases of perioral dermatitis.Three Japanese patients with perioral dermatitis were treated with cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate per os 100-300 mg/day. They were one girl (aged 10 years) and two adult women (aged 32 and 37 years respectively). One of the adult patients had a past history of Meniere's disease and the other had had a side effect, vertigo, from minocycline hydrochloride treatment. The presence of fusobacteria before and after the treatment was examined using the tape-stripping toluidine blue method.These patients showed the improvement in 1-2 weeks and were much improved or cured after 2-5 weeks. No side effects were found during the treatment. Fusobacteria were positive before treatment but became negative after the treatment in all of them.The ?-lactam antibiotics might be a useful treatment for perioral dermatitis, especially in cases who cannot take tetracyclines.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23240905","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.76079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.724645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.499933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tetracycline antibiotics","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics"},{"name":"Minocycline","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minocycline"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.276528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Fusobacterium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusobacterium"},{"name":"Toluidine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluidine"},{"name":"Perioral dermatitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioral_dermatitis"},{"name":"Tolonium chloride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolonium_chloride"},{"name":"Hydrate","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"}]}
