{"id":9951,"title":"Structural investigation of rhamnose-rich polysaccharides from Streptococcus dysgalactiae bovine mastitis isolate.","abstract":"Different rhamnose-rich polysaccharides (RRP) were identified in the cell envelope of the Gram-positive bovine mastitis isolate Streptococcus dysgalactiae 2023. Structural investigations of the 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance experiments as well as chemical analyses identified as main components l-Rha and d-GalNAc. Two main RRP were characterized, namely 1 being composed of the repeating unit {?3)-?-l-Rhap-(1?2)-[?-d-GalpNAc-(1?3)-?-d-GalpNAc-(1?3)-]?-l-Rhap-(1} and 2 possessing the repeat [?2)-?-l-Rhap-(1?3)-?-l-Rhap-(1?].
