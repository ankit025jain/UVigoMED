{"id":14016,"title":"Sternal osteosarcoma in a blue crane (Anthropoides paradiseus).","abstract":"A previously healthy, adult male blue crane (Anthropoides paradiseus) became peracutely distressed and ataxic. Examination revealed hemoptysis and a large mass associated with the cranial aspect of the sternum (keel). The patient died before treatment could be initiated. Gross necropsy revealed a large, hemorrhagic mass originating from the cranial aspect of the keel and extending into the cranial coelomic cavity. Histopathology confirmed the mass as an osteosarcoma. This is the first known report of an osteosarcoma in any crane species.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450072","annotations":[{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Human sternum","weight":0.57818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.145077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Body cavity","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_cavity"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Blue Crane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Crane"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Anthropoides","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropoides"},{"name":"Distressed securities","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distressed_securities"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Crane (machine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)"},{"name":"Keel","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Coelom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelom"}]}
