{"id":52804,"title":"Functional analysis of three novel cell lines derived from human papillary thyroid carcinomas with three different clinical courses.","abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most frequent thyroid carcinoma. PTC cell lines have been of considerable value in studying aspects of thyroid cancer, such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Here we report three novel PTC lines established from three patients with different backgrounds. Case 1 was a 38-year-old woman with PTC in the right thyroid lobe, with no metastasis. The cell line was established from the resection sample and named D-PTC. The cell line consisted of epithelial cells with few lysosomes and showed a pavement structure and follicular formation at confluency. There was a little pilling up. The secretion of free thyroxin (fT4) and thyroglobulin (Tg) was increased by TSH, or GH and IGF-I treatment. Case 2 was a 22-year-old woman with PTC initially in the right thyroid lobe, but 4Â years after the right lobe resection, PTC metastasis was observed in left lobe. The cell line was established from a sample of the second resection and named UD-PTC. This cell line consisted of small epithelial cells with evident lysosomes and exhibited floating cell clusters. The secretion of fT4 and Tg was slightly increased by TSH, or GH and IGF-I treatment. Case 3 was an 85-year-old man with PTC and with acromegaly. Metastasis was observed at cervical lymph nodes. The cell line was derived from the metastasis region and named A-PTC. This cell line consisted of small epithelial cells and many lysosomes. The cells frequently showed pilling up. The secretion of fT4 and Tg was significantly increased by GH and IGF-I treatment. We have established three PTC cell lines with substantial variation in their phenotype. The cell lines may be useful for thyroid cancer research.
