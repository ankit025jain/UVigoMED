{"id":60650,"title":"Smac mimetic and glucocorticoids synergize to induce apoptosis in childhood ALL by promoting ripoptosome assembly.","abstract":"Apoptosis resistance contributes to poor outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here, we identify a novel synergistic combination of Smac mimetic BV6 and glucocorticoids (GCs) (ie, dexamethasone, prednisolone) to trigger apoptosis in ALL cells. BV6 and GCs similarly cooperate to induce apoptosis in patient-derived leukemia samples, underlining the clinical relevance. Importantly, BV6/dexamethasone cotreatment is significantly more effective than monotherapy to delay leukemia growth in a patient-derived xenograft model of pediatric ALL without causing additional side effects. In contrast, BV6 does not increase cytotoxicity of dexamethasone against nonmalignant peripheral blood lymphocytes, mesenchymal stromal cells, and CD34-positive hematopoietic cells. We identify a novel mechanism by showing that BV6 and dexamethasone cooperate to deplete cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, thereby promoting assembly of the ripoptosome, a RIP1/FADD/caspase-8-containing complex. This complex is critical and is required for BV6/dexamethasone-induced cell death, because RIP1 knockdown reduces caspase activation, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death. Ripoptosome formation occurs independently of autocrine/paracrine loops of death receptor ligands, because blocking antibodies for TNF?, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or CD95 ligand or knockdown of death receptors fail to rescue BV6/dexamethasone-induced cell death. This is the first report showing that BV6 sensitizes for GC-triggered cell death by promoting ripoptosome formation with important implications for apoptosis-targeted therapies of ALL.
