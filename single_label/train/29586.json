{"id":29586,"title":"Self-management of pain among people who inject drugs in Vancouver.","abstract":"To evaluate factors and methods associated with self-management of pain among people who inject drugs (IDUs) in Vancouver (Canada).This cross-sectional study used bivariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression to analyze self-reported responses among 483 IDUs reporting moderate-to-extreme pain in two prospective cohort studies from 1 December 2012 to 31 May 2013.Median age was 49.6 years (interquartile range: 43.9-54.6 years), 33.1% of IDUs were female and 97.5% reported self-management of pain. Variables independently and positively associated with self-managed pain included having been refused a prescription for pain medication (adjusted odds ratio: 7.83; 95% CI: 1.64-37.3) and having ever been homeless (adjusted odds ratio: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.00-13.7). Common methods of self-management of pain included injecting heroin (52.7%) and obtaining diverted prescription pain medication from the street (65.0%).Self-management of pain was common among IDUs who reported moderate-to-extreme pain in this setting, particularly among those who had been refused a prescription for pain medication and those who had ever been homeless. These data highlight the challenges of adequate pain management among IDUs.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641341","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.743165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.735403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.483927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.456329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.337965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.324648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.21779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.147858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Vancouver","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"May 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_31"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"954","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/954"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Street","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
