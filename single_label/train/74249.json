{"id":74249,"title":"Pertuzumab. Promising for some women with metastatic breast cancer, but more assessment needed.","abstract":"Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy can prolong overall survival among women with metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer that overexpresses HER-2 protein. Pertuzumab (Perjeta, Roche) is a monoclonal antibody that targets HER-2. It has a different binding site from that of trastuzumab, another anti-HER-2 antibody. Pertuzumab has been authorised in the European Union as an adjunct to the trastuzumab + docetaxel combination. A double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial involving 808 carefully selected patients (including two men), followed for about 2.5 years, showed that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab + docetaxel prolonged overall survival: it was estimated that the 3-year survival rate increased by 10% to 15%. Median progression-free survival was 6 months longer in the pertuzumab group. Addition of pertuzumab did not aggravate cardiac toxicity among patients with a low cardiovascular risk at baseline. In contrast, adding pertuzumab increased the incidence of potentially severe diarrhoea, mucocutaneous disorders (rash, dry skin, mucosal inflammation) and febrile neutropenia. In practice, these results are interesting but they must be confirmed in other comparative trials before recommending routine use of pertuzumab.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24860893","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Cardiotoxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotoxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.725665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.710405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.639929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.477896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Febrile neutropenia","weight":0.328623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia"},{"name":"Pertuzumab","weight":0.243968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertuzumab"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Metastatic breast cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Xeroderma","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeroderma"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hoffmann-La Roche","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
