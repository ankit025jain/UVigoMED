{"id":52407,"title":"microRNA-206 overexpression inhibits cellular proliferation and invasion of estrogen receptor ?-positive ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"The expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER ?) are closely associated with estrogen-dependent growth, invasion and response to endocrine therapy in ER?-positive ovarian cancer. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that ER? is a direct target of microRNA (miR)-206. miR-206 has been found to be an important tumor suppressor in several cancer types, including ovarian, gastric and laryngeal cancer. However, the specific role of miR-206 in ovarian cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-206 in ER-a positive ovarian cancer in vitro. The present study demonstrated that miR-206 is significantly downregulated in ER?-positive but not ER??negative ovarian cancer tissues, compared with normal ovarian epithelium tissue. It was also found that the expression of miR-206 was decreased in ER?-positive ovarian cancer cell lines, CAOV-3 and BG-1, compared with normal ovarian epithelium tissues. This suggests that miR-206 may play a role in ER?-positive ovarian cancer cells via an estrogen-dependent mechanism. Further analysis revealed that 17?-E2 treatment significantly promoted cellular proliferation and invasion of estrogen-dependent CAOV-3 and BG-1 cells, which could be reversed by the introduction of miR-206 mimics. In conclusion, the present study suggests that miR-206 has an inhibitory role in estrogen-dependent ovarian cancer cells. Thus, miR-206 may be a promising candidate for the endocrine therapy of ER?-positive ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604205","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.826307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.7441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.661561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.29878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"}]}
