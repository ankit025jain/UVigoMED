{"id":35917,"title":"Differences of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations in children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.","abstract":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, frequently associated with reduced bone mineral density. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations in NF1 adults are lower than in healthy controls in autumn respectively winter and are inversely correlated with the number of dermal neurofibromas. We investigated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels in children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 in winter and summer and compared them to healthy controls to get more pathogenic insights in vitamin D3 metabolism in NF1 patients.NF1 patients were clinically examined and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations were measured in 58 NF1 adults and 46 children in winter as well as in summer and compared to sex-, age- and month-matched controls.52 adults suffered from 10 to 5000 dermal neurofibromas, whereas none of the children presented neurofibromas. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 increased from winter to summer (mean: 21.0 to 46.5nmol/l) in NF1 adults. This increase was even larger (p=0.0001) than in healthy controls (mean: 50.5 to 60.5nmol/l). However, there were no differences of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations in NF1 children and healthy controls both in winter and in summer.Only adults with NF1 showed lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels in winter and summer, which are unlikely due to impaired UV-dependent dermal synthesis, but rather might be caused by an accelerated catabolism.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613576","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.810129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.74998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.737751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.650287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.602586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.428474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.409729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis type I","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis_type_I"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.202112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"Autumn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn"},{"name":"Neurofibroma","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibroma"}]}
