{"id":82472,"title":"Effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on orthodontically induced root resorption in beagle dogs.","abstract":"We investigated the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption in vivo. Ten beagle dogs were treated with an orthodontic appliance to move the mandibular fourth premolars bodily. The orthodontic movement was carried out for 4 wk with a continuous force of 1 N/side; using a split-mouth model, LIPUS was applied daily for 20 min. Fourth premolar and surrounding periodontal tissue were evaluated with micro-computed tomography and hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. We calculated the number, volume and distribution of root resorption lacunae and their percentage relative to total root volume, orthodontic tooth movement and periodontal ligament space. There was no significant difference in orthodontic tooth movement between the two sides. LIPUS significantly reduced the number of orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption initiation areas by 71%, reduced their total volume by 68% and reduced their volume relative to the affected root total volume by 70%. LIPUS induced the formation of a precementum layer, thicker cementum and reparative cellular cementum.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613212","annotations":[{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Periodontal fiber","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_fiber"},{"name":"Cementum","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementum"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.814433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.765384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.728037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.616634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.356468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Beagle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Orthodontic technology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontic_technology"},{"name":"Lacuna (manuscripts)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacuna_(manuscripts)"},{"name":"Acid phosphatase","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_phosphatase"},{"name":"H&E stain","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&E_stain"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
