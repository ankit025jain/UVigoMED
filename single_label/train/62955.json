{"id":62955,"title":"Retroperitoneal Castleman's disease: advocating a multidisciplinary approach for a rare clinical entity.","abstract":"Castleman's disease is a rare and poorly understood disease entity that may resemble more common conditions and represents a clinical challenge to the treating surgeon.In this report, we describe a case of a 61-year-old Caucasian woman with a symptomatic retroperitoneal mass. The specimen obtained from her resection contained a protuberant encapsulated mass, exhibiting microscopic features consistent with localized, unicentric Castleman's disease. These characteristics included architectural features and immunohistochemical findings consistent with the hyaline vascular variant of Castleman's disease.We report a very rare case of a retroperitoneal hyaline vascular type of Castleman's disease. We discuss the diagnostic dilemma Castleman's disease may present to the surgeon, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary management of these patients. We also review current data on pathogenesis, treatment and outcomes.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495409","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.578351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.534078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.41446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Hyaline","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaline"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Dilemma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary approach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
