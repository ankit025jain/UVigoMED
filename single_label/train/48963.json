{"id":48963,"title":"A decade of change in the uptake of parathyroidectomy in England and Wales.","abstract":"Since the late 1990s, a number of factors have reduced the threshold for parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. This study examined whether this has translated into increased numbers of parathyroid operations over the last decade.A retrospective analysis was performed of the Patient Episode Database for Wales and English Hospital Episode Statistics annual data from 2000 to 2010 for parathyroidectomy admissions per 100,000 population. Statistical analysis was by linear regression.Between 2000 and 2010 there were 24,247 parathyroid operations in England and Wales (0.005% of the population), with 3 times as many women treated as men. Overall, incidence of parathyroidectomy rose from 3.3/100,000 population in 2000 to 5.8/100,000 in 2010 (p<0.0001). In England, it increased from 3.3/100,000 population to 5.8/100,000 and in Wales, it increased from 2.4/100,000 population to 4.6/100,000. Despite similar population demographics, the difference in the rate of change between England and Wales was significant (p<0.05). Uptake also varied according to age; in those aged 0-14 years, incidence of parathyroidectomy remained static whereas in all other age groups, uptake of parathyroidectomy increased significantly from 2000 to 2010. Most notably, surgical intervention in those aged 60-74 and >75 years nearly doubled over the decade (p<0.0001).The incidence of parathyroidectomy in adults has increased significantly in the last decade in England and Wales. This likely reflects changes in population demography, available guidelines, lower threshold for referral, changing surgical approach and the realisation that surgical morbidity is now infrequent.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992415","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.674499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"England","weight":0.59066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.433055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.376886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.329395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"England and Wales","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales"},{"name":"Wales","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Parathyroidectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroidectomy"},{"name":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Statics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Marvel UK","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_UK"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"GM 60-Degree V6 engine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_60-Degree_V6_engine"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 6100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6100"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 8100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8100"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"}]}
