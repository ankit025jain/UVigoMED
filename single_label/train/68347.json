{"id":68347,"title":"Impact of urinary incontinence on healthcare resource utilization, health-related quality of life and productivity in patients with overactive bladder.","abstract":"To evaluate the impact of urinary incontinence (UI) on healthcare resource utilization (HRU), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and productivity measures in patients with overactive bladder (OAB).This retrospective, cross-sectional study used data from the Adelphi OAB/UI Disease Specific Programme, a multinational survey of patient- and physician-reported data, fielded between November 2010 and February 2011. The primary patient groups of interest were those with OAB, both with and without UI. Health-related quality of life and productivity measures were derived from the EuroQoL-5D, the Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. Measures of HRU included OAB-related surgeries, OAB-related hospitalizations, incontinence pads, anticholinergic use and physician visits. Multivariate linear regression models and literature-based minimal clinically important differences were used to assess statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in HRQoL and productivity measures between patients with OAB with UI and those without UI.A total of 1?730 patients were identified, with a mean age of 60.7 years, and 77.0% of them were women, 84.2% were non-Hispanic whites, and 71% were incontinent. Bivariate analyses showed that HRU was significantly higher among patients with OAB with UI than among those without UI in all categories except for the number of OAB-related physician visits. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, incontinent patients presented with clinically and statistically significantly lower HRQoL and productivity measures with respect to all study endpoints, except for percentage of work time missed due to their OAB/UI.Urinary incontinence was associated with significantly higher HRU and lower HRQoL and productivity in this population of patients with OAB from five different countries. In addition to clinical considerations, the economic and humanistic impact of UI should be taken into account when evaluating treatment options for patients with OAB.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528881","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.590954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Humanism","weight":0.225489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Anticholinergic","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
