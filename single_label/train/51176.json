{"id":51176,"title":"Survival rate of early stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium treated at Srinagarind Hospital.","abstract":"To evaluate the survival outcome of early stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with risk factors for locoregional recurrence treated with combined pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) after comprehensive surgery.Post-operative radiotherapy by pelvic EBRT and VBT for early stage endometrioid endometrial carcinoma resulted in excellent pelvic control with acceptable complications. This study showed no significant relationships between age, stage, histologic grade and LVSI and overall survival rate.The 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of early stage endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma was 85.7%. Acute toxicity occurred in 38.1% of the patients, all of whom were grade 1 or 2. Total late toxicity developed in 42.9% of study group, in which 36.99% of them were grade 1-2 and 4.76% were grade 3-4.Post-operative radiotherapy by pelvic EBRT and VBT is acceptable for early stage endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, independent of age, stage, histologic grade and LVSI.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716960","annotations":[{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.792072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.519241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.248132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"First grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade"},{"name":"Twelfth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_grade"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Vainu Bappu Observatory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vainu_Bappu_Observatory"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"}]}
