{"id":29457,"title":"[Factors associated with dropout from a group cognitive behavioral therapy for substance use disorder].","abstract":"Dropout represents one of important issues in psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders. In Japan, group therapies based on cognitive behavioral therapies such as Serigaya Methamphetamine Relapse Prevention Program (SMARPP) have been conducted. Little is known, however, about factors associated with dropout from group cognitive behavioral therapies for substance use disorders.The purpose of the present study is to clarify factors which are associated with dropout in group cognitive behavioral therapies for substance use disorders. In this study, dropout is defined as being absent of the final session and attending to less than 9 of 28 sessions.Fifty-three patients with substance use disorder participated in this study. The group program conducted in this study is a group cognitive behavioral therapy. Variables related to demographic (age, gender, education level, marital status, and criminal record), drug use (age at which s/he used drug and the length during which s/he is abstinent from using drugs), and the initial session (mood states before and after the session, and satisfaction with the session) were compared between 20 patients who dropped out (dropout group) and 33 completers (complete group).Compared to the participants in the complete group, those in the dropout group were more likely to be female and showed a shorter period during which s/he had been abstinent from using drugs.These results suggest that additional attention need to be paid to participant with these characteristics for preventing dropout.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660557","annotations":[{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.810453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.740915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.533933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.487569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.353742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.263731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0179676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
