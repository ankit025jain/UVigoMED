{"id":43463,"title":"B7-H3 was highly expressed in human primary hepatocellular carcinoma and promoted tumor progression.","abstract":"B7-H3 has been detected in different cancers and correlated to tumor progression and outcome in cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the expression of B7-H3 in tissues and cells of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) patients. The research showed that B7-H3 is aberrantly expressed in PHC tissues and cells, and its high expression on HepG2 cells significantly promotes cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion capacity; moreover, it inhibits the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells. Thus, B7-H3 may have a critical role in PHC and it may enhance tumor escape from the immune surveillance of CD8(+) T cells.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787022","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.698407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.675505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.3166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hep G2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep_G2"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Port Harcourt International Airport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt_International_Airport"},{"name":"B7 (protein)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B7_(protein)"},{"name":"Histone H3","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H3"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
