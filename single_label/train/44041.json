{"id":44041,"title":"Endoscopic diagnosis of early Barrett's neoplasia: perspectives for advanced endoscopic technology.","abstract":"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic condition that occurs secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease. BE is also a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma, which, although still rare in Japan, is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in Western countries. However, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease has increased significantly over the past few decades in Japan, possibly leading to an incremental rise in BE and the associated inherent risk of adenocarcinoma. Given the poor prognosis of advanced-stage Barrett's adenocarcinoma, endoscopic surveillance is recommended for subjects with BE to detect early neoplasias including dysplasia. However, endoscopic identification of dysplastic lesions is still not sufficiently reliable or subjective, making targeted therapy extremely difficult. Over the past few years, improvements in image resolution, image processing software, and optical filter technology have enabled identification of dysplasia and early cancer in BE patients. We retrieved as many studies on advanced endoscopic technologies in BE as possible from MEDLINE and PubMed. The present review focuses on the emergent clinically available technologies to provide an overview of the technologies, their practical applicability, current status, and future challenges.
