{"id":90814,"title":"A comparison of outcomes after K-wire fixation of distal radius fractures with and without associated ulnar styloid fracture.","abstract":"A prospective study was carried out to compare outcomes after K-wire fixation of distal radius fractures without and with associated ulnar styloid fracture, but without fixation of the styloid fracture.70 patients, 60 women (86%) and 10 men (14%) with a mean age of 63 years were enrolled. 35 patients had an isolated fracture of the distal radius and 35 had an associated fracture of the ulnar styloid. All patients underwent percutaneous, \"augmented\" K-wire fixation of the distal radius fracture; the ulnar styloid fracture was left untreated. The patients were followed-up at 3 and 6 months. The stability of the distal radioulnar joint and the DASH scores were considered to be primary outcome measures.Instability of the distal radioulnar joint was diagnosed in 2 patients with ulnar styloid fracture. No significant and clinically meaningful differences were found between the groups in clinical (pain, wrist mobility, grip strength, DASH score) and radiological outcomes. The rate of non-union of the ulnar styloid was 77% at final assessment.An unrepaired ulnar styloid fracture does not affect the outcome of a distal radius fracture which is fixed by the \"augmented\" K-wire method.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573824","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Distal radioulnar articulation","weight":0.331763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radioulnar_articulation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.311973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.174805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0174397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Temporal styloid process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_styloid_process"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Flight dynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics"},{"name":"Radioulnar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Radioulnar joint","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar_joint"}]}
