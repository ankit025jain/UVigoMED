{"id":19752,"title":"Clinical characteristics and mortality risk factors of cryptococcal infection among HIV-negative patients.","abstract":"Describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, outcomes, complications, and factors associated with mortality of cryptococcosis in HIV-negative patients.A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-negative adult patients with positive culture for Cryptococcus neoformans between 2005 and 2010.Forty-nine HIV-negative patients were identified with median (IQR) age of 62.5 (45.5-71.9) years of which 40.8% were male. The common underlying medical conditions were cardiovascular diseases (36.7%). The common sites of positive culture were cerebrospinal fluid/intracerebral abscess (46.9%), blood (36%), and sputum/bronchoalveolar larvage fluid (28.6%). Twenty-nine (59.2%) patients had co-infections with another organism, such as Gram-negative bacteria (24.4%), M. tuberculosis (17.8%), and Gram-positive bacteria (13.3%). The common clinical presentations were fever (67.3%), alteration of consciousness (34.7%), and headache (26.5%). Complication was detected in 61.2% such as acute kidney injury (47.0%), coma (38.8%), and shock (22.4%). The overall mortality was 51%. By multivariate logistic regression, factors associated with mortality were alteration of consciousness (adjusted OR = 6.85; 95% CI: 1.41-33.28, p = 0.017) and co-infections (adjusted OR = 5.32; 95% CI: 1.25-22.69, p = 0.024).The mortality rate of HIV-negative patients with cryptococcosis is very high. Early recognition and treatment of cryptococcosis in HIV-negative patients are crucial and may improve the outcome.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701727","annotations":[{"name":"Cryptococcosis","weight":0.899074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcosis"},{"name":"Cryptococcus neoformans","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.763775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.690264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.648144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.614233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.52625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.513739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Cryptococcus","weight":0.47113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.31393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.23879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.118236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"}]}
