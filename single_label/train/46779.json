{"id":46779,"title":"Endoscopic ultrasound with double-balloon endoscopy in the evaluation of small-bowel disease.","abstract":"Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) has become a new standard in enteroscopy. However, it may be difficult to make a diagnosis or plan treatment strategy with endoscopic visualization alone. The addition of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has the potential to improve the ability to establish the diagnosis and develop a treatment strategy. The present study was conducted to assess the feasibility and usefulness of EUS with DBE.EUS with DBE was performed in 31 of 891 patients who underwent DBE from July 2004 to March 2011 at Jichi Medical University Hospital. We analyzed the EUS findings for lesions and evaluated the usefulness of EUS considering the following three factors: qualitative diagnostic value for lesions, depth grading of lesions, and evaluation of the structure of severe strictures prior to endoscopic balloon dilation.EUS was performed for 31/32 lesions (97%) in 31 patients. EUS findings were informative for 29/32 lesions (91%). EUS findings were useful for establishing a qualitative diagnosis in 15/25 lesions (60%). EUS findings for depth grading provided useful information for determining the therapeutic strategy in 11/13 lesions (85%). EUS with DBE was useful in the evaluation of strictures for all six lesions (100%). The overall usefulness of EUS with DBE on decision making was 72% (23/32) in this study.EUS with DBE is feasible and useful. It provides additional information on small-bowel disease and contributes to establishing a precise diagnosis and selection of an appropriate therapeutic strategy.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619330","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.745479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.577927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.304947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Endoscopic ultrasound","weight":0.298719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_ultrasound"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Order of the British Empire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"891","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/891"},{"name":"1113","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1113"},{"name":"1525","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1525"},{"name":"24th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century_BC"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"}]}
