{"id":47312,"title":"TAp63 suppress metastasis via miR-133b in colon cancer cells.","abstract":"TAp63 is a tumour-suppressor protein that is often underexpressed in various types of cancer. It has been shown to activate gene transcription depending on the transcription domain and to be closely related with metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate that TAp63 suppresses metastasis in colon cancer cells through microRNA-133b.We evaluated the correlation of TAp63 and miR-133b with HT-29 and SW-620 cells and investigated the roles of TAp63 in the expression of RhoA, E-cadherin and vimentin. We further investigated the roles of TAp63-mediated invasion and migration of colon cancer cells.TAp63 expression is downregulated in colon cancer, and microRNA-133b is a transcriptional target of TAp63. Furthermore, microRNA-133b is essential for the inhibitory effects of TAp63 on RhoA, E-cadherin and vimentin. Moreover, TAp63 inhibits cell migration and invasion through microRNA-133b. Correspondingly, the inhibitory effect of TAp63 on RhoA, E-cadherin, vimentin, migration and invasion can be blocked by the microRNA-133b inhibitor.TAp63 and microRNA-133b were able to suppress the metastasis of colon cancer. Both TAp63 and microRNA-133b may be potential biomarkers for diagnosis in colon cancer metastasis and may provide unique therapeutic targets for this common malignancy.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594999","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.780386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.753216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.616634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.541668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.476784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"RHOA","weight":0.384059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHOA"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.247009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"}]}
