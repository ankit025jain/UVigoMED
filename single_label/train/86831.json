{"id":86831,"title":"[Ways of improving adherence on telaprevir-based therapy in patients with chronic HCV infection].","abstract":"To present the ways of improving adherence on telaprevir-based therapy in patients with chronic HCV infection.Telaprevir is a direct antiviral agent, registered in Russian Federation as a treatment for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR). Phase III clinical trials showed a significant improvement in efficacy when adding telaprevir to pegylated interferon and ribavirin compare to the duel PR treatment along. Standard telaprevir regiment 750 mg 3 times per day is associated with difficulties in keeping adherence to the treatment. Here we present the results of administering telaprevir 1125 mg twice daily.Telaprevir-based 1125 mg twice daily regimen in combination with PR is comparable with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours treatment if looking at rates of SVR, relapse incidence, viralogical insufficiency, pharmacokinetics, safety, also taking in consideration higher treatment adherence even in HCV cirrhotic patients.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518489","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.807379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.654509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.64515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.256982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.24897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"1125","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1125"},{"name":"Duel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Talent agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Regiment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
