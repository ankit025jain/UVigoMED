{"id":82795,"title":"Oral squamous cell carcinomas in age distinct population: a comparison of p53 immunoexpression.","abstract":"The study aimed to assess the diffused expression of p53 protein in patients with OSCC and its association with age at diagnosis (using 50 years as a cut point).Ten normal oral mucosa and sixty OSCC lesions from age-distinct patient populations were immunohistochemically analyzed for the expression of p53 protein.In OSCC cases, 31 out of total 60 cases (51.67%) showed positive expression for p53 protein and it was more common in older study group (56.67%) than in younger study group (46.67%) but the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, there was also no significant difference in the p53 indices (percentage of p53 positive cells) between the two study groups (P = 0.827).The alteration rates were found to be slightly higher in older patients although not statistically significant.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518701","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.759279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.532539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.451744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.375466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.262541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.169459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.032094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"827","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/827"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"}]}
