{"id":67562,"title":"Fertility issues in cancer survivorship.","abstract":"Breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis and treatment have led to dramatic improvements in survival and the need to focus on survivorship issues. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be gonadotoxic, resulting in impaired fertility. Techniques to help cancer survivors reproduce have been improving over the past decade. Discussion of the changes to a patient's reproductive health after cancer treatment is essential to providing comprehensive quality care. The purpose of this review is to aid in pre- and posttreatment counseling, focusing on fertility preservation and other strategies that may mitigate risks to the patient's reproductive, sexual, and overall health.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604743","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Reproductive health","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.576605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Fertility preservation","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_preservation"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0388965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Climate change mitigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
