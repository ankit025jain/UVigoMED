{"id":53812,"title":"[Determination and correlation analysis of contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine in necrotic tissue, blood, and urine of patients with diabetic foot].","abstract":"To determine and perform a correlation analysis of the contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine in necrotic tissue, blood, and urine of patients with diabetic foot (DF).Ten patients with severe wet necrotizing DF hospitalized from January 2011 to January 2012 were assigned as group DF, and 10 orthopedic patients with scar but without diabetes or skin ulcer hospitalized in the same period were assigned as control group. Samples of necrotic tissue from feet of patients in group DF and normal tissue from extremities of patients in control group, and samples of blood and 24-hour urine of patients in both groups were collected, and the amount of each sample was 10 mL. Contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine were determined with high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data got from the determination of blood and urine were processed with t test, and those from necrotic or normal tissue with Wilcoxon rank sum test. The correlation of contents of polyamines between necrotic tissue and blood, blood and urine were processed with simple linear regression analysis.(1) Contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine in the necrotic tissue of group DF were (186.1 ± 26.8), (78.553 ± 12.441), (33 ± 10) mg/kg, which were significantly higher than those in normal tissue of control group [(2.2 ± 1.2), (1.168 ± 0.014), 0 mg/kg, with Z values respectively -3.780, -3.781, -4.038, P values all below 0.01]. The content of putrescine in necrotic tissue of group DF was significantly higher than those of cadaverine and histamine (with Z values respectively -3.780, -3.630, P values all below 0.01). (2) Contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine in the blood of group DF were (0.075 ± 0.013), (0.022 ± 0.003), (0.052 ± 0.014) mg/L, and they were significantly higher than those in the blood of control group [(0.014 ± 0.009), (0.013 ± 0.003), (0.016 ± 0.008) mg/L, with t values respectively 6.591, 2.207, 3.568, P < 0.05 or P<0.01]. The content of putrescine in the blood of group DF was significantly higher than those of cadaverine and histamine (with t values respectively 13.204, 3.096, P values all below 0.01). (3) Contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine in the urine of group DF were (0.735 ± 0.088), (0.450 ± 0.012), (0.1623 ± 0.0091) mg/L, and only the contents of putrescine and cadaverine were significantly higher than those in the urine of control group [(0.050 ± 0.014), (0.035 ± 0.007) mg/L, with t values respectively 3.270, 4.705, P<0.05 or P<0.01]. The content of putrescine in the urine of group DF was significantly higher than that of cadaverine (t = 6.686, P < 0.01). (4) There were significant and positive correlations in contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine between necrotic tissue and blood in patients of group DF (with r values respectively 0.981, 0.994, 0.821, P values all below 0.01). There were no significant correlations in contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine between blood and urine in patients of group DF (with r values respectively 0.150, 0.239, 0.177, P values all above 0.05).Putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine exist in the necrotic tissue of patients with DF in high concentrations, among which putrescine predominates. These polyamines can be absorbed into the blood through wound and excreted through the urine.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System
