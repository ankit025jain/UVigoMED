{"id":88524,"title":"Cost effectiveness of external hip protectors in the hospital setting: a modeling study.","abstract":"Chronic illnesses, for which many patients are admitted to hospitals, substantially increase the risk of falling, and hence the likelihood of incurring a hip fracture. Hip fractures not only have devastating consequences on an individual's quality of life but may also affect a hospital's reputation in the community. In addition, hospitals may face litigation claims and increased costs for patients who fall and suffer a major injury as a consequence. External hip protectors are comparable to padded undergarments and shield the trochanter, reducing the detrimental effects and force impacting the bone during a fall. Screening for patients at high risk of falling and providing high-risk patients with hip protectors as a preventive measure to avoid hip fractures, not only improves public health, but can also save hospitals care and litigation costs.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834633","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.599758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.246439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.240088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.125396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Undergarment","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergarment"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Shield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
