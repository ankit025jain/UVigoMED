{"id":35597,"title":"[Ultrasound diagnosis of congenital intrahepatic portosystemic shunt].","abstract":"To investigate the ultrasonographic features of congenital intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt (CIPSVS) and to assess the clinical value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CIPSVS.Six cases of CIPSVS diagnosed in our hospital between March 2010 and March 2012 and confirmed by enhanced computed tomography (CT) were retrospectively reviewed. Five of the six cases had follow-up data that was included in the analysis.Among the six CIPSVS cases, only one was classified as Park's type II and the rest were classified as Park's type III. Five cases involved the right lobe of the liver and only one case involved the left lobe. The lesion shapes included cystic, tubular, and irregular with clear contour and appeared to be anechoic on CT scan. The lesions ranged in size from 1.1*0.6 cm to 2.0*1.7 cm. For all cases, the color Doppler ultrasound images showed blood flowing from the portal vein to the hepatic vein, and single-phase spectrum was detected in the diversion channel. The differences observed in level of lesion size and blood flow velocity at the shunt from the time of examinations at diagnosis and subsequent follow-up did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.223 more than 0.05 and P = 0.930 more than 0.05 respectively).Although cases of CIPSVS are rare, they share some specific sonographic features that may help in diagnosis. Color Doppler ultrasound findings have high diagnostic accuracy and may represent a preferred modality for follow-up monitoring.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636298","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.748652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.739777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.714613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.660126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.654222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.608874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Left lobe of liver","weight":0.582375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_lobe_of_liver"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.484125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.476849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Right lobe of liver","weight":0.469775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_lobe_of_liver"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.366311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.358497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.289775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Portosystemic shunt","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portosystemic_shunt"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
