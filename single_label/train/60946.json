{"id":60946,"title":"Wandering spleen torsion causing acute abdominal pain in a child: case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Wandering spleen is a rare occurrence where the spleen normal fixation to the abdominal wall is lost and thus allowed to change in position. We report a case of a child who presented with acute abdominal pain secondary to a wandering spleen complicated by torsion of its vascular pedicle. The diagnosis was promptly made using computed tomography and managed with splenectomy.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791368","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.755469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.646552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.553399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.549722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.521141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Wandering spleen","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_spleen"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
