{"id":47272,"title":"[Preoperative evaluation of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with a virtual three-dimensional multi-imaging].","abstract":"Intraoperative palpation around the target organs and an overview of the operative field are difficult to achieve in laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. Understanding the three-dimensional anatomy of the target organs and the neighboring structures along with a precise preoperative diagnosis is essential in individual cases for completion of an appropriate laparoscopic procedure. A routine virtual three-dimensional multi-imaging integrating PET/MDCT, CT colonography and CT angiography is useful for a precise diagnosis. Local anatomy and patient's features directly affect surgical outcome, especially in the laparoscopic surgery for the rectal cancer. CT pelvimetry is useful for a preoperative prediction of the difficulties of the laparoscopic surgery. These data should be taken into account when planning this procedure.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597352","annotations":[{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.695008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.635353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.209345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pelvimetry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvimetry"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"}]}
