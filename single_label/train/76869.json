{"id":76869,"title":"Resistance and religion: health care in Uganda, 1971-1979.","abstract":"This article situates women's roles in community health care during violence in Uganda in the 1970s. It examines the lived reality of Catholic missionary sister nurses, midwives, and physicians on the ground where sisters administered health care to local communities. The goal is to examine how religious women worked with local individuals and families in community health during periods of violence and war. Catholic sisters claimed to be apolitical, yet their mission work widened to include political issues. As they saw local Ugandans threatened, sisters engaged in political activities by their identification with and protection of \"their people.\" ","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892863","annotations":[{"name":"Religion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Missionary","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.52135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.517041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Catholic","weight":0.455593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic"},{"name":"War","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.403148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Nun","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun"},{"name":"Midwifery","weight":0.339985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.33271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"1970s","weight":0.323631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s"},{"name":"Mission (Christianity)","weight":0.304556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_(Christianity)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.254349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"1970","weight":0.140244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.120805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Shilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling"},{"name":"Resistance movement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement"},{"name":"Apolitical","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolitical"}]}
