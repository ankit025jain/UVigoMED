{"id":66387,"title":"Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer with a late, complete and durable response to docetaxel chemotherapy: a case report.","abstract":"Although treatment options for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer have improved in recent years, the outlook for patients remains poor, with overall survival in the region of 2 years. Response rates with chemotherapy are modest and disease progression is usually observed within months of stopping treatment.We present a case of a 72-year-old White man of British origin with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer with bulky lymphadenopathy and a serum prostate-specific antigen of 295 ?g/L. He received treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy plus prednisolone, but received just 3 cycles before treatment was stopped due to toxicity and lack of response (prostate-specific antigen was 276 ?g/L 4 weeks after the last dose and there was a confirmed stable appearance on computed tomography scan). Unexpectedly, at follow-up 4 months later, the patient was clinically better; his prostate-specific antigen had dramatically improved to 4.1 ?g/L and a re-staging computed tomography scan revealed complete resolution of his bulky lymphadenopathy. At the time, he was receiving a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue but no other disease-modulating treatment. He remains well and asymptomatic, with his most recent serum prostate-specific antigen measuring 0.14 ?g/L, 18 months after last receiving chemotherapy.We report a case of complete and durable regression of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer following palliative chemotherapy which, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been reported in the literature.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717107","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.534903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.425589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.30566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
