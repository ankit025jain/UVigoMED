{"id":76602,"title":"Association of serum fetuin-A and biochemical parameters in hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"Fetuin-A, a hepatic glycoprotein present in the circulation, is a potential inhibitor for systemic calcification. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fetuin-A and other biochemical parameters as facilitator factors for developing atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This case-control study was conducted on 44 HD patients undergoing treatment in 2012. Parathormone (i-PTH) and fetuin levels were performed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) by chemiluminescence, low-density lipoprotein by direct enzymatic, calcium and albumin by colorimetric and phosphorous by ultraviolet (UV) methods. Chi-square was used for evaluating the association between variables and t-test was used for comparing the mean of the quantitative variables for the two groups. SPSS-16 software was used for data analysis and P-value less than 5% was considered as significant. Mean of serum fetuin level was 23.25 ± 4.90 ng/mL in HD patients and 32.92 ± 5.21 in the control group. Median of hs-CRP was 2.45 mg/dL in the patients and 1.00 mg/dL in the control group and i-PTH was 74.3 pg/mL in the patients and 7.30 pg/mL in the control group. The calcium-phosphorous product was 46.77 ± 14.22 mg/dL in the patient and 31.73 ± 6.48 mg/dL in the control group. A reverse significant association was found between fetuin-A and hs-CRP in this study. In this study, serum fetuin-A level in HD patients was lower than controls. Therefore, a low level of fetuin-A seems to be associated with atherosclerosis, inflammation and malnutrition.
