{"id":64470,"title":"Increased percentages of PD-1 on CD4+ T cells is associated with higher INF-? production and altered IL-17 production in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Programmed death (PD)-1 is a cell death receptor that, upon stimulation, leads to apoptosis. Previous studies have shown alteration of PD-1 expression on T cells and PD-1 genes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to assess the expression of this receptor on effector T cells in patients with SLE.In this study we enrolled 32 SLE patients and 31 healthy controls. T cells from peripheral blood were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression of PD-1. Interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells were investigated for the expression of this co-stimulatory marker.Percentages of CD4(+) T cells expressing PD-1 were significantly increased in patients with SLE compared to healthy controls. The percentage of PD-1 expression was correlated with the production of INF-? (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001). We also investigated the production of IL-17 by PD-1(+) CD3(+) T cells. Inactive patients (3.2 ± 1.2% vs. 5.9 ± 3.5%, p = 0.002) and patients without lupus nephritis (LN) (3.2 ± 1.5% vs. 5.9 ± 3.5%, p = 0.005) showed lower levels of IL-17 compared to healthy controls.We have demonstrated increased expression of PD-1 on CD4(+) T cells in SLE patients and an association between PD-1 expression on CD4(+) T cells and IFN-? expression on CD3(+) T cells. We have also shown that there is an altered subset of PD-1(+) T cells in inactive patients and patients without LN producing lower amounts of IL-17.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25088926","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.898986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.724967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.582717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Lupus nephritis","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.352246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.31885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.104334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
