{"id":51751,"title":"Omarigliptin (MK-3102): a novel long-acting DPP-4 inhibitor for once-weekly treatment of type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"In our effort to discover DPP-4 inhibitors with added benefits over currently commercially available DPP-4 inhibitors, MK-3102 (omarigliptin), was identified as a potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile amenable for once-weekly human dosing and selected as a clinical development candidate. This manuscript summarizes the mechanism of action, scientific rationale, medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetic properties, and human efficacy data for omarigliptin, which is currently in phase 3 clinical development.
