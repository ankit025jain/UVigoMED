{"id":57201,"title":"Clinical validation of embryo culture and selection by morphokinetic analysis: a randomized, controlled trial of the EmbryoScope.","abstract":"To determine whether incubation in the integrated EmbryoScope time-lapse monitoring system (TMS) and selection supported by the use of a multivariable morphokinetic model improve reproductive outcomes in comparison with incubation in a standard incubator (SI) embryo culture and selection based exclusively on morphology.Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study.University-affiliated private in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic.Eight hundred forty-three infertile couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).No patient intervention; embryos cultured in SI with development evaluated only by morphology (control group) and embryos cultured in TMS with embryo selection was based on a multivariable model (study group).Rates of embryo implantation, pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy (OPR), and early pregnancy loss.Analyzing per treated cycle, the ongoing pregnancy rate was statistically significantly increased 51.4% (95% CI, 46.7-56.0) for the TMS group compared with 41.7% (95% CI, 36.9-46.5) for the SI group. For pregnancy rate, differences were not statistically significant at 61.6% (95% CI, 56.9-66.0) versus 56.3% (95% CI, 51.4-61.0). The results per transfer were similar: statistically significant differences in ongoing pregnancy rate of 54.5% (95% CI, 49.6-59.2) versus 45.3% (95% CI, 40.3-50.4) and not statistically significant for pregnancy rate at 65.2% (95% CI, 60.6-69.8) versus 61.1% (95% CI, 56.2-66.1). Early pregnancy loss was statistically significantly decreased for the TMS group with 16.6% (95% CI, 12.6-21.4) versus 25.8% (95% CI, 20.6-31.9). The implantation rate was statistically significantly increased at 44.9% (95% CI, 41.4-48.4) versus 37.1% (95% CI, 33.6-40.7).The strategy of culturing and selecting embryos in the integrated EmbryoScope time-lapse monitoring system improves reproductive outcomes.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217875","annotations":[{"name":"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.594212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.543451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.460881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.184226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.143157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Teenage pregnancy","weight":0.0700436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Reproductive success","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_success"}]}
