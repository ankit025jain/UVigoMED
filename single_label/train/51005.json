{"id":51005,"title":"Efficacy and tolerability of different starting doses of sorafenib in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.","abstract":"Sorafenib has proven efficacy in advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), but many patients must reduce the dose or discontinue treatment because of toxicity. The tolerability and efficacy of lower starting doses of sorafenib for DTC remain largely unstudied. Methods. We retrospectively examined overall survival, time to treatment failure, time to progression, discontinuation rates, and dose-reduction and interruption rates in patients with metastatic DTC treated with first-line sorafenib outside of a clinical trial. Two patient groups were compared; group 1 received the standard starting dose of 800 mg/day, and group 2 received any dose lower than 800 mg/day. Results. We included 75 adult patients, with 51 in group 1 and 24 in group 2. Mean age at diagnosis was 54 years, and 56% were male. The most common histologies included 43% papillary thyroid cancer of the conventional type, 15% papillary thyroid cancer of the follicular variant, and 15% Hürthle cell carcinoma. Time to treatment failure was 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.6-14.3) in group 1 and 8 months (95% CI: 3.4-12.5) in group 2 (p = .56). Median overall survival was 56 months (95% CI: 30.6-81.3) in group 1 and 30 months (95% CI: 16.1-43.8) in group 2 (p = .08). Rates of discontinuation due to disease progression were 79% in group 1 and 91% in group 2, and 21% in group 1 and 9% in group 2 (p = .304) stopped treatment because of toxicity. Dose-reduction rates were 59% and 43% (p = .29), and interruption rates were 65% and 67% (p = .908) in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Conclusion. Efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in treatment-naïve DTC patients does not appear to be negatively influenced by lower starting daily doses.
