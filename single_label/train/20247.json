{"id":20247,"title":"Risk factors for treatment default in close contacts with latent tuberculous infection.","abstract":"1) To characterize risk factors for non-completion of latent tuberculous infection treatment (LTBIT), and 2) to assess the impact of LTBIT regimens on subsequent risk of tuberculosis (TB).Close contacts of adults aged ?15 years with pulmonary TB were prospectively enrolled in a multi-center study in the United States and Canada from January 2002 to December 2006. Close contacts of TB patients were screened and cross-matched with TB registries to identify those who developed active TB.Of 3238 contacts screened, 1714 (53%) were diagnosed with LTBI. Preventive treatment was recommended in 1371 (80%); 1147 (84%) initiated treatment, of whom 723 (63%) completed it. In multivariate analysis, study site, initial interview sites other than a home or health care setting and isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) were significantly associated with non-completion of LTBIT. Fourteen TB cases were identified in contacts, all of whom initiated IPT: two TB cases among persons who received ?6 months of IPT (66 cases/100 000 person-years [py]), and nine among those who received 0-5 months (median 2 months) of IPT (792 cases/100 000 py, P < 0.001); data on duration of IPT were not available for three cases.Only 53% (723/1371) of close contacts for whom IPT was recommended actually completed treatment. Close contacts were significantly less likely to complete LTBIT if they took IPT. Less than 6 months of IPT was associated with increased risk of active TB.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670696","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.842176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.836277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.742176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.578346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.379206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Isoniazid","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"792","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/792"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"1147","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1147"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"1371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1371"},{"name":"723","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/723"},{"name":"1714","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1714"},{"name":"Default (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Pinyin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
