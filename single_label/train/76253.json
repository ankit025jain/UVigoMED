{"id":76253,"title":"The endothelial protective effects of pioglitazone on insulin resistance in endothelial cells.","abstract":"Insulin resistance plays an important role in vascular endothelial damage and atherosclerosis. Pioglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing agent and can reduce insulin resistance.In this study, the cellular model of insulin resistance was used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the endothelial protective effects of pioglitazone in a vascular endothelial cell damage model.The results showed that pioglitazone could effectively increase the survival rate of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV), reduce apoptosis, and relieve insulin resistance damage. To understand the endothelial protective effect mechanisms of pioglitazone, we showed that 50 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL of pioglitazone could upregulate the levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and pioglitazone could induce NO levels.These results suggested that pioglitazone could have endothelial protective effects in a vascular endothelial cell damage model of insulin resistance and used to prevent beforehand and treat a vascular endothelial cell damage of insulin resistance.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134381","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.900892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.572249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Nitrous oxide","weight":0.281115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Umbilical vein","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_vein"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Pioglitazone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioglitazone"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Cell damage","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_damage"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"External cephalic version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_cephalic_version"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Cellular model","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_model"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
