{"id":79662,"title":"[Epidemic situation of oversea imported schistosomiasis in China and thinking about its prevention and control].","abstract":"The imported schistosomiasis cases in the Chinese literature and reports from the infectious disease monitoring information system from 1979 to 2013 were collected and compiled. Totally 365 cases were reported to be infected with outside schistosomiasis, including 239 cases of schistosomiasis haematobia (74.0%) and 71 cases of schistosomiasis mansoni (22.0%), and 42 foreigners (11.5%) and 323 Chinese (88.5%). The infection areas involved 15 countries and regions in Africa. Totally 74.92% of patients worked in the construction or geological prospecting in the wild field. According to the analysis of these cases, we found that the management system of prevention and control of imported schistosomiasis cases was not perfect including the high missing re-port rate, high misdiagnosis rate, and no standard diagnostic criteria. We suggest that all the levels of CDC or health administrative authorities should adopt the following relevant control measures to strengthen the imported schistosomiasis prevention and control in order to reduce the damage to the public health and the risk of the spread of African schistosomiasis in China: (1) to establish and perfect the imported schistosomiasis monitoring and control system in China; (2) to integrate the dynamic information platform of labor export and establish the comprehensive prevention and control management system of infectious diseases; (3) to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of oversea imported schistosomiasis; (4) to strengthen the research on the transmission risk of imported schistosomiasis in the territory of China.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051819","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious
