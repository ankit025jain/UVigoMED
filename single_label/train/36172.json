{"id":36172,"title":"Type A aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome: extent of initial surgery determines long-term outcome.","abstract":"Data on outcomes after Stanford type A aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome are limited. We investigated the primary surgery and long-term results in patients with Marfan syndrome who suffered aortic dissection.Among 1324 consecutive patients with aortic dissection type A, 74 with Marfan syndrome (58% men; median age, 37 years [first and third quartiles, 29 and 48 years]) underwent surgical repair (85% acute dissections; 68% DeBakey I; 55% composite valved graft, 30% supracoronary ascending replacement, 15% valve-sparing aortic root replacement; 12% total arch replacement; 3% in-hospital mortality) at 2 tertiary centers in the United States and Europe over the past 25 years. The rate of aortic reintervention with resternotomy was 24% (18 of 74) and of descending aorta (thoracic+abdominal) intervention was 30% (22 of 74) at a median follow-up of 8.4 years (first and third quartiles, 2.2 and 12.7 years). Freedom from need for aortic root reoperation in patients who underwent primarily a composite valved graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement procedure was 95±3%, 88±5%, and 79±5% and in patients who underwent supracoronary ascending replacement was 83±9%, 60±13%, 20±16% at 5, 10, and 20 years. Secondary aortic arch surgery was necessary only in patients with initial hemi-arch replacement.Emergency surgery for type A dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome is associated with low in-hospital mortality. Failure to extend the primary surgery to aortic root or arch repair leads to a highly complex clinical course. Aortic root replacement or repair is highly recommended because supracoronary ascending replacement is associated with a high need (>40%) for root reintervention.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594630","annotations":[{"name":"Marfan syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.560106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.374132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.225489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Descending aorta","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_aorta"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.0338889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"795","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/795"},{"name":"885","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/885"},{"name":"839","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/839"},{"name":"1324","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1324"},{"name":"953","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/953"},{"name":"2016","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure"},{"name":"Stanford University","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
