{"id":40516,"title":"[Effects of acupuncture at \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) on electro-activity and mechanical motility of migrating motor complex during jejunal digestion period in rats with detached jejunum].","abstract":"To observe the effects of acupuncture at \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) on electro-activity and mechanical motility at different phases of migrating motor complex (MMC) during jejunal digestion period in rats with detached jejunum, so as to explore the effect and mechanism of acupuncture on regulating intestinal movement.Sixteen adult SD rats were selected. Electrodes were implanted in the serous membrane of intestinal smooth muscl.e and high-sensitivity sensors of strain gauge were sutured on serosal surface, and then the rat was anesthetized and its jejunum was detached. Electro-acriviry and mechanical motility of jejunal smooth muscle were recorded simultaneously. Acupuncture was applied at \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) at MMC I , MMCII and MMC III, respectively, to observe its influence on electro-activity and mechanical motility.At phase of MMC I, there was no obvious change of the fast wave before and after the acupuncture, while the frequency and amplitude of slow wave and mechanical motility were both significantly decreased compared with baseline (P < 0.01). At MMCII-Ill, the frequency and amplitude of fast wave, slow wave and motility were all significantly decreased compared with baseline (P < 0.01). Acupuncture at \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) had prohibited effects on electro-activity and mechanical motility of jejunal smooth muscle in rats with detached jejunum.Acupuncture at \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) has obvious prohibited effects on electro-acrivity and mechanical motility at MMC I , MMC II and MMC III time phases in rats with detached jejunum. The possible mechanism is that acupuncture at \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) could prohibit jejunum movement through reflex path of skin-sympathetic.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022121","annotations":[{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.694658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Serous membrane","weight":0.540992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_membrane"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.516378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.407246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Migrating motor complex","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrating_motor_complex"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.365612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Peristalsis","weight":0.295147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.249069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.199465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Strain gauge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_gauge"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Single-family detached home","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Slow-wave sleep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-wave_sleep"},{"name":"Strain (materials science)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(materials_science)"},{"name":"MultiMediaCard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"}]}
