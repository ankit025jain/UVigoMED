{"id":83970,"title":"CD47 signaling regulates the immunosuppressive activity of VEGF in T cells.","abstract":"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) inhibits angiogenesis, in part, by interacting with the ubiquitous cell-surface receptor CD47. In endothelial cells, CD47 interacts directly with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, and TSP1 inhibits VEGFR2 phosphorylation and signaling by disrupting this association. We show that CD47 similarly associates with and regulates VEGFR2 in T cells. TSP1 inhibits phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and its downstream target Src in wild type but not in CD47-deficient human Jurkat and primary murine T cells. VEGFR2 signaling inhibits proliferation and TCR signaling in wild type T cells. However, ligation of CD47 by TSP1 or loss of CD47 expression reverses some inhibitory effects of VEGF on proliferation and T cell activation. We further found that VEGF and VEGFR2 expression are upregulated in CD47-deficient murine CD4(+) and human Jurkat T cells, and the resulting autocrine VEGFR2 signaling enhances proliferation and some TCR responses in the absence of CD47. Thus, CD47 signaling modulates the ability of VEGF to regulate proliferation and TCR signaling, and autocrine production of VEGF by T cells contributes to this regulation. This provides a mechanism to understand the context-dependent effects of TSP1 and VEGF on T cell activation, and reveals an important role for CD47 signaling in regulating T cell production of the major angiogenic factor VEGF.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200950","annotations":[{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.79758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.786694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.775151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.684281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.65317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.619134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.575346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.467447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Thrombospondin 1","weight":0.357569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin_1"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.289764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Thrombospondin","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"CD47","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD47"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Jurkat cells","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurkat_cells"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
