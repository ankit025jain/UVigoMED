{"id":51309,"title":"Proteomic analysis of A2780/S ovarian cancer cell response to the cytotoxic organogold(III) compound Aubipy(c).","abstract":"Aubipyc is an organogold(III) compound endowed with encouraging anti-proliferative properties in vitro that is being evaluated pre-clinically as a prospective anticancer agent. A classical proteomic approach is exploited here to elucidate the mechanisms of its biological actions in A2780 human ovarian cancer cells. Based on 2-D gel electrophoresis separation and subsequent mass spectrometry identification, a considerable number of differentially expressed proteins were highlighted in A2780 cancer cells treated with Aubipyc. Bioinformatic analysis of the groups of up-regulated and down-regulated proteins pointed out that Aubipyc primarily perturbs mitochondrial processes and the glycolytic pathway. Notably, some major alterations in the glycolytic pathway were validated through Western blot and metabolic investigations.This is the first proteomic analysis regarding Aubipyc cytotoxicity in A2780/S ovarian cancer cell line. Aubipyc is a promising gold(III) compound which manifests an appreciable cytotoxicity toward the cell line A2780, being able to overcome resistance to platinum. The proteomic study revealed for Aubipyc different cellular alterations with respect to cisplatin as well as to other gold compound such as auranofin. Remarkably, the bioinformatic analysis of proteomic data pointed out that Aubipyc treatment affected, directly or indirectly, several glycolytic enzymes. These data suggest a new mechanism of action for this gold drug and might have an impact on the use of gold-based drug in cancer treatment.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705091","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.829674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.733959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.494622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.387389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.315802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0867719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Auranofin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auranofin"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"}]}
