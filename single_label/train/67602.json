{"id":67602,"title":"Sinomenine reverses multidrug resistance in bladder cancer cells via P-glycoprotein-dependent and independent manners.","abstract":"P-Glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance is a frequent event during chemotherapy and a key obstacle for bladder cancer therapy. Search for strategies to reverse multidrug resistance is a promising approach to improve the management of bladder cancer. In the present study, we reported a novel P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistant cell model 253J/DOX, which was generated from human bladder cancer 253J cell line. Furthermore, we found that the multidrug resistant phenotype of 253J/DOX cells could be overcome by sinomenine, an alkaloid derived from the stem of Sinomenium acutum. Mechanistically, the chemosensitive effect by sinomenine was mediated by down-regulating P-glycoprotein expression, as well as triggering apoptotic pathways. The chemosensitive effect of sinomenine may make it a prime candidate agent to target bladder cancer.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601223","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.853583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.774475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Alkaloid","weight":0.701382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.496147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.209937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Prime number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Manners","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manners"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
