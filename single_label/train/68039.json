{"id":68039,"title":"[Malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the penis: a case report].","abstract":"We report the case of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (MFH/UPS) of the penis in a 78-years-old-man who had undergone previous radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy for prostatic adenocarcinoma. The mass was a 9-cm firm lesion at the base of the penis predominantly composed of malignant spindle cells arranged in sweeping fascicles and storiform pattern. The tumor cells stained for vimentin, beta-smooth muscle actin, S-100, and were negative for keratin, desmin, Melan A, PSA. Despite total penectomy, he developed a local reccurence 4 months after surgery, and died from dissemination 6 months after surgery. This is the 8th case of penile MFH/UPS.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564078","annotations":[{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.824689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.746783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.718362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.696416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.452344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Penectomy","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penectomy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Desmin","weight":0.380273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmin"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.346269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Spindle neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
