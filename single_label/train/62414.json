{"id":62414,"title":"MR quantitative susceptibility imaging for the evaluation of iron loading in the brains of patients with ?-thalassemia major.","abstract":"Patients with ?-thalassemia require blood transfusion to prolong their survival, which could cause iron overload in multiple organs, including the heart, liver, and brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify iron loading in the brains of patients with ?-thalassemia major through the use of MR quantitative susceptibility imaging.Thirty-one patients with thalassemia with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 25.3 (±5.9) years and 33 age-matched healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent MR imaging at 3T. Quantitative susceptibility images were reconstructed from a 3D gradient-echo sequence. Susceptibility values were measured in the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, and choroid plexus. General linear model analyses were performed to compare susceptibility values of different ROIs between the patients with thalassemia and healthy volunteers.Of the 31 patients, 27 (87.1%) had abnormal iron deposition in one of the ROIs examined. Significant positive age effect on susceptibility value was found in the putamen, dentate nucleus, substantia nigra, and red nucleus (P = .002, P = .017, P = .044, and P = .014, respectively) in the control subjects. Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with thalassemia showed significantly lower susceptibility value in the globus pallidus (P < .001) and substantia nigra (P = .003) and significantly higher susceptibility value in the red nucleus (P = .021) and choroid plexus (P < .001).A wide range of abnormal susceptibility values, indicating iron overloading or low iron content, was found in patients with thalassemia. MR susceptibility imaging is a sensitive method for quantifying iron concentration in the brain and can be used as a potentially valuable tool for brain iron assessment.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578278","annotations":[{"name":"Caudate
