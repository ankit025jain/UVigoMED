{"id":7993,"title":"Reproductive performance of sows with and without PRRS modified live virus vaccination in PRRS-virus-seropositive herds.","abstract":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus infection causes reproductive failures including return to oestrus, abortion, mummified foetuses, stillborn, and weak-born piglets. The objective of the present study was to investigate reproductive performance of sows in PRRS-virus-seropositive herds with and without PRRS modified live virus (PRRS-MLV) vaccination. The study was conducted in 20 PRRS-virus-seropositive commercial swine herds in Thailand. The data included 211,009 mating and 180,935 farrowing records. The analysed variables included farrowing rate (FR), return rate (RR), abortion rate (AR), total number of piglets born per litter (TB), number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), percentage of stillborn (SB), percentage of mummified foetuses (MM), and number of piglets weaned per litter (WP). The results revealed that FR in non-vaccinated sows was lower than that in vaccinated sows (85.0 vs 89.7%, respectively, P?<?0.001), and RR in non-vaccinated sows was higher than that in vaccinated sows (6.9 vs 3.7%, respectively, P?<?0.001). AR did not differ significantly between non-vaccinated and vaccinated sows (1.6 and 2.0%, respectively, P?=?0.964). TB (11.2 and 11.5, respectively, P?<?0.001), BA (10.0 and 10.6, respectively, P?<?0.001), and WP (9.2 and 9.6, respectively, P?<?0.001) in non-vaccinated sows were lower than those in vaccinated sows. SB (6.9 and 5.1%, respectively, P?<?0.001) and MM (3.2 and 2.2%, respectively, P?<?0.001) in PRRS-MLV-vaccinated sows were higher than those in non-vaccinated sows. The improvement in sow reproductive performance in PRRS-MLV-vaccinated herds was most pronounced in gilts and primiparous sows.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817371","annotations":[{"name":"Estrous cycle","weight":0.936098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrous_cycle"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.823181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Stillbirth","weight":0.678186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.672517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.659363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.599211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.59708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Mummy","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.400262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.392724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.321621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Litter (animal)","weight":0.0609528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(animal)"},{"name":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcine_Reproductive_and_Respiratory_Syndrome_Virus"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"French language","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"},{"name":"935","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/935"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Porsche 964","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_964"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Piglet (animal)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_(animal)"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pig farming","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_farming"}]}
