{"id":53639,"title":"Retrospective analysis of survival improvement by molecular biomarker-based personalized chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Aggressive tumors such as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are highly heterogeneous in their therapeutic response, making it difficult to improve overall response by using drugs in unselected patients. The goal of this study was to retrospectively, but independently, examine whether biomarker-based personalized chemotherapy selection could improve survival of EOC patients. Using in vitro drug sensitivity and patient clinical outcome data, we have developed co-expression extrapolation (COXEN) biomarker models for predicting patient response to three standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat advanced EOC: paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and topotecan, for which sufficient patient data were available for our modeling and independent validation. Four different cohorts of 783 EOC patients were used in our study, including two cohorts of 499 patients for independent validation. The COXEN predictors for the three drugs independently showed high prediction both for patient short-term therapeutic response and long-term survival for recurrent EOC. We then examined the potential clinical benefit of the simultaneous use of the three drug predictors for a large diverse EOC cohort in a prospective manner, finding that the median overall survival was 21 months longer for recurrent EOC patients who were treated with the predicted most effective chemotherapies. Survival improvement was greater for platinum-sensitive patients if they were treated with the predicted most beneficial drugs. Following the FDA guidelines for diagnostic prediction analysis, our study has retrospectively, yet independently, showed a potential for biomarker-based personalized chemotherapy selection to significantly improve survival of patients in the heterogeneous EOC population when using standard chemotherapies.
