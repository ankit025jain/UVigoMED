{"id":92259,"title":"[Problems of soils pollution with solid industrial waste in Kazakhstan].","abstract":"The problem of recycling and disposal of solid waste from metallurgical, energy and petrochemical industries is becoming more acute problem for Kazakhstan. Violations of hygiene requirements concerning the placement and operation of landfills increase the area of contaminated soil and can become a threat to environmental safety of the population in industrial centers. The research was aimed to evaluate soil contamination in the cities and towns of Kazakhstan Republic and to mark out health risk areas. Five localities with especially high levels of soil contamination were revealed. Visualization of ecological contamination on individual urban areas gives to ecologists a tool to analyze and solve medical ecology problems. The results of soil contamination mapping can contribute earmarking of funds by local authorities to carry out measures for optimizing the environment.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Disorders of Environmental Origin","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549452","annotations":[{"name":"Soil contamination","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_contamination"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Recycling","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Landfill","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Petrochemical","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Municipal solid waste","weight":0.625719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Industrial waste","weight":0.526496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_waste"},{"name":"Local government","weight":0.475208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"City","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Metallurgy","weight":0.329545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Kazakhstan","weight":0.269715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.258789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.229404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Human settlement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
