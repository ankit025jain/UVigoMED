{"id":20629,"title":"Pediatric herpes simplex virus infections: an evidence-based approach to treatment.","abstract":"Herpes simplex virus is a common virus that causes a variety of clinical presentations ranging from mild to life-threatening. Orolabial and genital herpes are common disorders that can often be managed in an outpatient setting; however, some patients do present to the emergency department with those conditions, and emergency clinicians should be aware of possible complications in the pediatric population. Neonatal herpes is a rare disorder, but prompt recognition and initiation of antiviral therapy is imperative, as the morbidity and mortality of the disease is high. Herpes encephalitis is an emergency that also requires a high index of suspicion to diagnose. Herpes simplex virus is also responsible for a variety of other clinical presentations, including herpes gladiatorum, herpetic whitlow, eczema herpeticum, and ocular herpes. This issue reviews the common clinical presentations of the herpes simplex virus, the life-threatening infections that require expedient identification and management, and recommended treatment regimens.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649621","annotations":[{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Herpes genitalis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_genitalis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.792843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.741161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.718336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.50943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.50194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Herpetic whitlow","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpetic_whitlow"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Neonatal herpes simplex","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Eczema herpeticum","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema_herpeticum"},{"name":"Whitlow","weight":0.0294124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitlow"},{"name":"Herpesviral encephalitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviral_encephalitis"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Rubella virus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella_virus"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
