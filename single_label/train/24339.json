{"id":24339,"title":"Tinea atypica.","abstract":"Although usually simple, the diagnosis of dermatophyte infection is sometimes neglected. Variations in clinical presentation (tinea atypica), mimicking other skin diseases depend on many factors, partially due to the dermatophyte's characteristics, and a combination of patient's pathological but often physiological conditions, such as excessive washing or sun exposure. The physician's misdiagnosis and eventual prescription of steroids or other incongruous treatments further induce pathomorphosis (tinea incognito), longstanding disease and delayed recovery. This review describes the morphology of some atypical dermatophyte infections, in an attempt to compare and correlate changes to the normal features of the disease by site of involvement. The risk factors and predisposing conditions are also analysed to provide a reasoned interpretation of morphology and therefore evoke the diagnostic suspect in atypical cases. Periodical training is the clue to improve dermatologist expertise in what is the first-sight ability to make a diagnosis, perform the correct assessments and consequent therapy in daily practice.
