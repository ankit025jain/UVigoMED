{"id":1243,"title":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of endomyocardial fibrosis.","abstract":"Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in the tropics and has been underdiagnosed in the past. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate EMF from other restrictive cardiomyopathies. Cur- rently, echocardiography is used for the initial investigations that might lead to a diagnosis of EMF. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging as an alternative noninvasive diagnostic tool. Twenty- eight patients (17 men and 11 women; aged 51.9 +/- 13.5 years), who were diagnosed as having restrictive cardiomyopathy after comprehensive echocardiography, underwent CMR imaging with the standard cardiomyopathy protocol. EMF was diagnosed in seven (25%) of these patients. Five patients with EMF had bi-ventricular involvement and one each had right and left ventricular involvement. Myocardial edema indicating acute inflammation was seen in one (14.3%) patient. Apical thrombus was seen in four (57.1%) cases. Subendocardial delayed enhancement was always present in the involved ventricles. Our results show that CMR imaging with late gadolinium enhancement can clearly detect the common hallmarks of EMF: endocardial fibrous tissue and obliteration of the involved ventricular apex.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417517","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hypereosinophilic syndrome","weight":0.670417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereosinophilic_syndrome"},{"name":"Endocardium","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocardium"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Restrictive cardiomyopathy","weight":0.516762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictive_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.430914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.323126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Electromagnetic field","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Apex of the heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_of_the_heart"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
