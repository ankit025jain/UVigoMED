{"id":16958,"title":"Epidemiology and microbiology of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli other than serogroup O157 in England, 2009-2013.","abstract":"The implementation of direct testing of clinical faecal specimens for gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens by PCR offers a sensitive and comprehensive approach for the detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The introduction of a commercial PCR assay, known as GI PCR, for the detection of GI pathogens at three frontline hospital laboratories in England between December 2012 and December 2013 led to a significant increase in detection of STEC other than serogroup O157 (non-O157 STEC). In 2013, 47 isolates were detected in England, compared with 57 in the preceding 4 years (2009-2012). The most common non-O157 STEC serogroup detected was O26 (23.2?%). A total of 47 (47.5?%) STEC isolates had stx2 only, 28 (28.3?%) carried stx1 and stx2, and the remaining 24 (24.2?%) had stx1 only. Stx2a (64.0?%) was the most frequently detected Stx2 subtype. The eae (intimin) gene was detected in 52 (52.5?%) non-O157 STEC isolates. Six strains of STEC O104 had aggR, but this gene was not detected in any other STEC serogroups in this study. Haemolytic ureamic syndrome was significantly associated with STEC strains possessing eae [odds ratio (OR) 5.845, P?=?0.0235] and/or stx2a (OR 9.56, P?=?0.0034) subtypes. A matched case-control analysis indicated an association between non-O157 STEC cases and contact with farm animals. Widespread implementation of the PCR approach in England will determine the true incidence of non-O157 STEC infection, highlight the burden in terms of morbidity and mortality, and facilitate the examination of risk factors to indicate whether there are niche risk exposures for particular strains.
