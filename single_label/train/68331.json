{"id":68331,"title":"Association of the triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio with the risk of chronic kidney disease: analysis in a large Japanese population.","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).We used data from 216,007 Japanese adults who participated in a nationwide health checkup program. Men (n = 88,516) and women (n = 127,491) were grouped into quartiles based on their TG/HDL-C levels (<1.26, 1.26-1.98, 1.99-3.18, and >3.18 in men; <0.96, 0.96-1.44, 1.45-2.22, and >2.22 in women). We cross-sectionally assessed the association of TG/HDL-C levels with CKD [defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (low eGFR) and/or proteinuria (defined as urinary protein ? 1+ on dipstick testing)], low eGFR, and proteinuria.The prevalence of CKD, low eGFR, and proteinuria increased significantly with elevating quartiles of TG/HDL-C in both genders (all P for trend <0.001). Participants in the highest quartile of TG/HDL-C had a significantly greater risk of CKD than those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for the relevant confounding factors (odds ratio: 1.57, 95% confidence interval: 1.49-1.65 in men; 1.41, 1.34-1.48 in women, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant associations with low eGFR and proteinuria. In stratified analysis, the risk of CKD increased linearly with greater TG/HDL-C levels in participants with and without hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Moreover, higher TG/HDL-C levels were relevant for CKD, especially in participants with hypertension and diabetes (P for interaction <0.001, respectively).An elevated TG/HDL-C is associated with the risk of CKD in the Japanese population.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529154","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.930781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.726288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.600941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.470446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.20327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Dipstick","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipstick"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
