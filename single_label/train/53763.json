{"id":53763,"title":"The islet estrogen receptor-? is induced by hyperglycemia and protects against oxidative stress-induced insulin-deficient diabetes.","abstract":"The female steroid, 17?-estradiol (E2), is important for pancreatic ?-cell function and acts via at least three estrogen receptors (ER), ER?, ER?, and the G-protein coupled ER (GPER). Using a pancreas-specific ER? knockout mouse generated using the Cre-lox-P system and a Pdx1-Cre transgenic line (PER?KO ?/?), we previously reported that islet ER? suppresses islet glucolipotoxicity and prevents ?-cell dysfunction induced by high fat feeding. We also showed that E2 acts via ER? to prevent ?-cell apoptosis in vivo. However, the contribution of the islet ER? to ?-cell survival in vivo, without the contribution of ER? in other tissues is still unclear. Using the PER?KO ?/? mouse, we show that ER? mRNA expression is only decreased by 20% in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, without a parallel decrease in the VMH, making it a reliable model of pancreas-specific ER? elimination. Following exposure to alloxan-induced oxidative stress in vivo, female and male PER?KO ?/? mice exhibited a predisposition to ?-cell destruction and insulin deficient diabetes. In male PER?KO ?/? mice, exposure to E2 partially prevented alloxan-induced ?-cell destruction and diabetes. ER? mRNA expression was induced by hyperglycemia in vivo in islets from young mice as well as in cultured rat islets. The induction of ER? mRNA by hyperglycemia was retained in insulin receptor-deficient ?-cells, demonstrating independence from direct insulin regulation. These findings suggest that induction of ER? expression acts to naturally protect ?-cells against oxidative injury.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498408","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Arcuate nucleus","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcuate_nucleus"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.74293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.708333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.684339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.479702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.467904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.459993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
