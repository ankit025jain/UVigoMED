{"id":10265,"title":"Slight alteration of the electroretinogram in mice lacking dystrophin dp71.","abstract":"Most Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and the mdx(Cv3) mouse strain, lacking expression of both dystrophins Dp260 and Dp71, show a high attenuation of the dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave amplitude, whereas mice lacking the expression of Dp260 show normal b-wave amplitude. Here, we completed our assessment of whether the sole absence of Dp71 affects the ERG.Ganzfeld ERGs were performed on dark-adapted Dp71-null mice and littermates. Scotopic flash ERGs were recorded at light intensities from 3.10-(5) to 1 cd.s/m(2). Oscillatory potentials (OPs) were extracted at 1 cd.s/m(2). Photopic flash ERGs were recorded at 10 cd.s/m(2) after light adaptation.Dp71-null mice showed a slight but significant reduction in b-wave amplitudes, normal a-wave amplitudes and nonaffected implicit times of the scotopic ERGs. No changes were observed in the amplitudes and implicit times of the OPs and the photopic ERGs.Our results demonstrate that together both Dp71 and Dp260 are required for the generation of the ERG b-wave in mice.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662427","annotations":[{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.384722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.278263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.244307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.110256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Photopic vision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision"},{"name":"Scotopic vision","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision"},{"name":"Dystrophin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophin"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Candela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/260"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Double penetration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_penetration"},{"name":"Strain (materials science)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(materials_science)"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Service mark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_mark"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Probability amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"},{"name":"Observation post","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_post"}]}
