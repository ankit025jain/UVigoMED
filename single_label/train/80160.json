{"id":80160,"title":"Colonization and maintenance of Anopheles kleini and Anopheles sinensis from the Republic of Korea.","abstract":"Colonization of members of the Anopheles Hyrcanus Group is required to facilitate a better understanding of their roles in the epidemiology, vector competence, transmission potential, and maintenance of vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea (ROK). A total of 158 resting blood-fed wild caught Anopheles species were collected on August 26, 2011 at Tongilchon, near the demilitarized zone, in the ROK and shipped on August 28, 2011 to the Entomology Department, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), Bangkok, Thailand. Four of the 5 species of the Anopheles Hyrcanus Group (Anopheles kleini, An. sinensis, An. pullus, and An. belenrae) were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Eggs were obtained from parent populations, and F, progeny provided blood meals using membrane feeding techniques. The mean numbers of eggs/female for An. sinensis and An. kleini were 157 and 146, respectively. Membrane blood feeding rates for An. sinensis (90.6%) and An. kleini (89.0%) were similar for F1-F30 generations. Colonies of An. kleini and An. sinensis were established by force mating techniques and maintained by the Insectary Section, Entomology Department, AFRIMS, to date. This is the 1st report of successful laboratory colonization of An. kleini collected from a vivax malaria high-risk area in the ROK.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772671","annotations":[{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.825543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.821198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.774535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Bangkok","weight":0.731343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.628189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.608393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.513801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.490724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Entomology","weight":0.435948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.247671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"August 26","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_26"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"August 28","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_28"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Demilitarized zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Armed forces","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"}]}
