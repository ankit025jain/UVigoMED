{"id":42525,"title":"The P2Y2 nucleotide receptor mediates the proliferation and migration of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells induced by ATP.","abstract":"ATP is an abundant biochemical component of the tumor microenvironment and a physiologic ligand for the P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R). In this study, we investigated the effect of ATP on the cellular behavior of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the role of P2Y2R in ATP action and aimed to find a new therapeutic target against HCC. The experiments were performed in native isolated human HCC cells, normal hepatocytes, human HCC cell lines, and nude mice. We found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of P2Y2R in native human HCC cells and the human HCC cell lines HepG2 and BEL-7404 were enhanced markedly compared with human normal hepatocytes and the normal hepatocyte line LO2, respectively. ATP induced intracellular Ca(2+) increases in HCC cells and promoted the proliferation and migration of HCC cells and the growth of HCC in nude mice. The P2Y receptor antagonist suramin, P2Y2R-specific shRNA, the store-operated calcium channel inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and 1-(?-3-(4-methoxy-phenyl) propoxyl-4-methoxyphenethyl)1H-imidazole-hydrochloride (SKF96365), and stromal interaction molecule (STIM1)-specific shRNA inhibited the action of ATP on HCC cells. In conclusion, P2Y2R mediated the action of ATP on the cellular behavior of HCC cells through store-operated calcium channel-mediated Ca(2+) signaling, and targeting P2Y2R may be a promising therapeutic strategy against human HCC.
