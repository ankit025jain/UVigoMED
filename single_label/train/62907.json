{"id":62907,"title":"Neurocognitive outcome and white matter anisotropy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors treated with different protocols.","abstract":"Neurocognitive outcome affects the quality of life of ALL survivors. This study is aimed to assess the prevalence of neurocognitive dysfunction by psychometric and imaging tools in survivors of childhood ALL, treated with 3 different protocols and the effect of time elapsed since the end of chemotherapy. Sixty-two ALL survivors aged 6-18Â years and treated in the period 1997-2007 and 60 healthy age and sex matched controls were subjected to neurocognitive testing using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Benton visual retention (BVRT) and Trail Making test (TMT), followed by diffusion weighed and diffusion tensor MRI for calculation of fraction anisotropy (FA). Survivors underwent revision of protocol and type of CNS therapy. Three different protocols were used: modified BFM 83, BFM 90, and CCG. Survivors treated with modified CCG protocol showed a significant decrease in all cognitive tests compared to control (p<.05); BFM 90 group had a significant lower IQ and longer TMT compared to both control and BFM 83 group and no significant difference was found in results of cognitive tests between BFM 83 and control group. Frontal FA was lower in CCG treated group compared to control, BFM 90 and BFM 83 groups (p<.05); meanwhile it was significantly lower in BFM 90 and BFM 83 groups compared to control group. We concluded that patients treated with modified CCG protocol showed the worst neurocognitive outcome among three assessed protocols. Frontal lobe FA might be an early marker for predicting the neurotoxicity in childhood ALL survivors.
