{"id":88743,"title":"Non-irradiated frozen structural allograft in reconstructive surgeries of the hindfoot and midfoot.","abstract":"A few studies investigating the use of structural allograft in foot and ankle surgery are available. The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical, functional and radiological results of patients treated with non-irradiated frozen structural bone allograft.We analyzed 20 reconstructive surgeries of the hindfoot and midfoot performed between April 2004 and April 2010. The mean follow up period was 45.4 months. The results were evaluated according to AOFAS score, X-ray (allograft consolidation, alignment preservation, and allograft collapse or re-absorption), and complications.We observed a 48-point mean improvement of AOFAS ankle and hindfoot score (17 cases), and a 53-point mean improvement of AOFAS midfoot score (3 cases). The mean bone consolidation time was 75 days. No graft fracture and no cases of non-union were seen.This treatment is a good option to treat severe defects or fill sequelae deformities.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796831","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.693966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.554105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.438398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.2313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.222255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Reabsorption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reabsorption"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"}]}
