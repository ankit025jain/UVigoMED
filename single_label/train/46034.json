{"id":46034,"title":"Association between maternal inflammatory bowel disease and adverse perinatal outcomes.","abstract":"To examine whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with ischemic/inflammatory conditions during pregnancy.A retrospective cohort study using the 2000 to 2012 Kaiser Permanente Southern California maternally-linked medical records (n=395?781). The two major subtypes of IBD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's diseases were studied. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to quantify the associations.A pregnancy complicated by IBD was associated with increased incidence of small-for-gestational age birth (OR=1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14 to 1.88), spontaneous preterm birth (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.00 to 1.76) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.26 to 3.02). Further stratifying by IBD subtypes, only ulcerative colitis was significantly associated with increased incidence of ischemic placental disease, spontaneous preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes.The findings underscore the potential impact of maternal IBD on adverse perinatal outcomes. Clinicians should be aware that the association between IBD and adverse perinatal outcome varies by IBD subtypes.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651735","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.790693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.78851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.708893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.44845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.425848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"California","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Premature rupture of membranes","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_rupture_of_membranes"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Kaiser Permanente","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Permanente"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Rupture of membranes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupture_of_membranes"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"}]}
