{"id":84967,"title":"Survival benefit of lung transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Sweden.","abstract":"Lung transplantation (LTx) is a therapeutic option for patients with life-threatening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that is refractory to conventional therapies. The survival benefit of LTx for COPD is difficult to assess. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Swedish series of LTx performed to treat COPD and to identify differences in outcome between COPD related to severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and COPD with normal alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) levels.We retrospectively reviewed the data of 342 patients (128 AATD and 214 non-AATD) receiving lung transplants for end stage COPD from 1990 through 2012.The majority (71%) of patients received a single lung transplant. The median survival time after LTx for all COPD patients was 9 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8 to 10). Non-AATD recipients had a shorter survival time than AATD recipients, 6 years (95% CI: 5.0 to 8.8) versus 12 years (95% CI: 9.6 to 13.5, p = 0.000). Mortality was higher among non-AATD recipients after adjusting for age, pack-years of smoking, body mass index, oxygen therapy use, exercise capacity, donor age, cytomegalovirus mismatch, and transplant type (hazard ratio 1.70, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.82). The 5-year and 10-year survival rates for the AATD recipients were 75% and 59%, respectively, compared with 60% and 31% for the non-AATD recipients. Early deaths were mainly due to cardio/cerebrovascular accidents and sepsis, and late deaths to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and pulmonary infections.Survival after LTx is significantly better for patients with severe AATD and end stage COPD than for the patients with COPD related to cigarette smoking.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443001","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.888107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.797443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.728546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Lung transplantation","weight":0.727622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.508002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.502063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alpha 1-antitrypsin","weight":0.358524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_1-antitrypsin"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.333138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis obliterans","weight":0.308333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis_obliterans"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.152194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis","weight":0.0887379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0602196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
