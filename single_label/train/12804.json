{"id":12804,"title":"[Therapeutic effects and the underlying mechanism of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells for bleomycin induced lung injury in rats].","abstract":"To study the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.UC-MSCs were isolated from the umbilical cord after parental consent. One hundred C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (12 of these for preliminary experiment). Mice in the control group (n = 20) were instilled with PBS via trachea and NS was injected via the tail vein after 3 days. Mice in the stem cell group (n = 20) were instilled with PBS via trachea and were injected with MSC via the tail vein after 3 days. Mice in the bleomycin group (n = 24) were instilled with bleomycin via trachea and NS was injected via the tail vein after 3 days. Mice in the bleomycin plus stem cell group (n = 24) were instilled with bleomycin via trachea and were injected with MSCs via the tail vein after 3 days. All of the mice were sacrificed at the 21(th) day, and the lungs were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 µmol/L thickness. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson-trichrome. Histopathological scoring of pulmonary fibrosis was performed according to Ashcroft's method. The concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1were determined using immunohistochemistry.Compared with the bleomycin group, MSC transplantation significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and deposition of collagen in the bleomycin plus stem cell group [(1.55 ± 0.51) vs (2.16 ± 0.77), and (1.45 ± 0.60) vs (2.32 ± 0.82), respectively, P < 0.05]. There was no difference between the control group and the stem cell group [(0.35 ± 0.49) vs (0.37 ± 0.50), P > 0.05]. The expression of MMP-2 in the bleomycin plus stem cell group was lower than the bleomycin group [(1.59 ± 0.59) vs (2.37 ± 0.68), P < 0.05], but there was no difference between the control group and the stem cell group [(0.80 ± 0.69) vs (0.84 ± 0.77), P > 0.05]. The expression of TIMP-1 in the bleomycin plus stem cell group was higher than the bleomycin group [(1.95 ± 0.58) vs (0.79 ± 0.71), P < 0.05], but there was no difference between the control group and the stem cell group [(1.10 ± 0.72) vs (1.32 ± 0.58), P > 0.05].UC-MSC transplantation could relieve bleomycin-induced fibrosing alveolitis in mice. The mechanism might be related to the expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-1. UC-MSC had no effect on normal lungs.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507390","annotations":[{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.865861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.855011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.749326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.747075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"H&E stain","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&E_stain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.508726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.439345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.327694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Alveolitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolitis"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"}]}
