{"id":44149,"title":"Present status of endoscopy, therapeutic endoscopy and the endoscopy training system in Indonesia.","abstract":"Recently, Indonesia was ranked as the fourth most populous country in the world. Based on 2012 data, 85000 general practitioners and 25000 specialists are in service around the country. Gastrointestinal (GI) disease remains the most common finding in daily practise, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, and ranks fifth in causing mortality in Indonesia. Management of patients with GI disease involves all health-care levels with the main portion in primary health care. Some are managed by specialists in secondary health care or are referred to tertiary health care. GI endoscopy is one of the main diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in the management of GI disease. Development of GI endoscopy in Indonesia started before World War II and, today, many GI endoscopy procedures are conducted in Indonesia, both diagnostic and therapeutic. Based on August 2013 data, there are 515 GI endoscopists in Indonesia. Most GI endoscopists are competent in carrying out basic endoscopy procedures, whereas only a few carry out advanced endoscopy procedures, including therapeutic endoscopy. Recently, the GI endoscopy training system in Indonesia consists of basic GI endoscopy training of 3-6 months held at 10 GI endoscopy training centers. GI endoscopy training is also eligible as part of a fellowship program of consultant gastroenterologists held at six accredited fellowship centers in Indonesia. Indonesian Society for Digestive Endoscopy in collaboration with GI endoscopy training centers in Indonesia and overseas has been working to increase quality and number of GI endoscopists, covering both basic and advanced GI endoscopy procedures.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750141","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"World War II","weight":0.800245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Indonesia","weight":0.659258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.630003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.461875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.459073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.389116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.272125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.150717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.0885189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0432258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"List of countries by population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population"},{"name":"List of countries by GDP sector composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_sector_composition"},{"name":"Accreditation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accreditation"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Scholarship","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship"}]}
