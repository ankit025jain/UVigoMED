{"id":81219,"title":"A feasible method to eliminate nanoleakage in dentin hybrid layers.","abstract":"To determine whether high-pressure air blowing during adhesive application affects the infiltration of resin comonomers and nanoleakage manifestation in the resin/dentin interface under simulated pulpal pressure.Thirty mid-coronal dentin surfaces were bonded with an etch-and-rinse adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2) under simulated pulpal pressure. In the control group, the adhesive was thinned by ordinary air blowing with a pressure of 0.2 MPa, while in the experimental group, a high-pressure air blowing technique (pressure: 0.4 MPa) was used. All other procedures followed the manufacturer's instructions. Resin tag formation and nanoleakage in the bonding interface were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).When adhesive was thinned with high pressure air blowing, longer and more homogeneous resin tags were formed. The bonding interface demonstrated good overall morphology and integrity. Almost perfect infiltration of resin and no obvious nanoleakage were observed.Thinning of adhesive with high-pressure air blowing provides a clinically feasible adjunctive procedure for better resin infiltration.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264547","annotations":[{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.699535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.690137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.390261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.20132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Data integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Ordinary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Tag (metadata)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)"},{"name":"Interface (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(chemistry)"}]}
