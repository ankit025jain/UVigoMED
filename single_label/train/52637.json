{"id":52637,"title":"The diabetic vasculature: physiological mechanisms of dysfunction and influence of aerobic exercise training in animal models.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a number of complications of which chronic vascular complications are undoubtedly the most complex and significant consequence. With a significant impact on health care, 50-80% of people with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and other vascular disease), making it the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. A healthy lifestyle is essential in the management of DM, especially the inclusion of aerobic exercise, which has been shown effective in reducing the deleterious effects in vasculature. Interest in exercise studies has increased significantly with promising results that demonstrate a future for investigation. Considering the importance of this emerging field, the aim of this mini-review is to summarize and integrate animal studies investigating physiological mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and remodeling in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and how these are influenced by chronic aerobic exercise training.
