{"id":32145,"title":"Woman with x-linked recessive dystonia-parkinsonism: clue to the epidemiology of parkinsonism in Filipino women?","abstract":"Despite recessive inheritance, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (Lubag disease) has also been described in women presenting with a late-onset isolated parkinsonian syndrome. Interestingly, unlike in other populations, there is a slight female predominance in the prevalence of parkinsonism in the Philippines.In a Filipino woman with suspected Parkinson disease, we confirmed the presence of all changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism in genomic DNA. Subsequently, we analyzed complementary DNA and evaluated the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. Owing to extremely skewed (98%:2%) X-chromosome inactivation, the patient expressed almost solely the mutated allele in a disease-specific change, rendering her molecularly comparable with a hemizygously affected man.Skewed X-chromosome inactivation is the likely cause of parkinsonism in this heterozygous mutation carrier. Because women carriers of the genetic changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism are common in the Philippines, the epigenetic factor of nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to the skewing of the sex prevalence of parkinsonism toward women in this country, warranting further investigation.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004170","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.822937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.814555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.68719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.627778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.573012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Complementarity (molecular biology)","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Philippines","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}]}
