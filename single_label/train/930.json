{"id":930,"title":"[Systematic review of efficacy and safety of shenmai injection for chronic heart failure].","abstract":"The paper is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shenmai injection for chronic heart failure, retrieving the Pubmed, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang database and VIP database to comprehensively collect all types research report of Shenmai injection for chronic heart failure (CHF). Particularly wishing to point out, randomized controlled trials are include for the evaluation of effectiveness, which are statistically analyzed and evaluated by Rev-Man 5. 2. The current studies show that the improvement rate of NYHA classification of cardiac function of CHF patients and their related indexes figure such as LVEF, SV, CO, BNP, 6 min walking test value are all improved by the combination of Shenmai injection and foundation treatment. However, HR is almost no improvement. Meanwhile, serious ADR/AE of Shenmai injection for CHF isn't appear.","date":"2014-12-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25532414","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.810405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.616645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.57446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.452618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.14755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Brain natriuretic peptide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Research report","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_report"},{"name":"Certified Broadcast Meteorologist","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Broadcast_Meteorologist"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Very Important Person","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"}]}
