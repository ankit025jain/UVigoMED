{"id":87042,"title":"[Group enterovirus infection due to coxsackievirus A16 in Northwestern Russia].","abstract":"Study features of epidemic process and etiology of oral cavity and limb enterovirus exanthema group diseases in a number of territories of Northwestern Russia.Isolation and identification of non-poliomyelitis enteroviruses from material of patients was carried out according to WHO recommendations. Phenotyping and phylogenetic analysis of enteroviruses was carried out.In 3 territories of Northwestern Russia oral cavity and limb enterovirus group diseases were registered. Children aged less than 14 years, predominately aged less than 3 years, were shown to be involved in the epidemic process. Coxsackie A16 enteroviruses from 27 samples of patients were isolated in cell cultures and identified by using specific sera. Coxsackie A16 enteroviruses from 16 samples were identified by using partial sequencing of VP1 genome area. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the identified Coxsackie A16 viruses distributed among 2 phylogenetic groups.Coxsackie A16 enteroviruses that had never been detected in the region previously were established to be the etiologic factor of oral cavity and limb enterovirus exanthema group disease in the 3 territories of Northwestern Russia. The data obtained give evidence on the necessity of epidemiologic and virological control for enterovirus infection with the aim of obtaining novel information on the circulation of non-poliomyelitis enteroviruses in the population and the establishment of development patterns for epidemic process of this infection.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051697","annotations":[{"name":"Enterovirus","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterovirus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.793451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.762778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Coxsackievirus","weight":0.573199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackievirus"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.39878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.348674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.235425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Exanthem","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exanthem"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
