{"id":80006,"title":"Electroclinical characteristics of new-onset seizures associated with neurocysticercosis.","abstract":"Although seizures are the most common presentation of neurocysticercosis (NCC), the electroclinical characteristics of the seizures have not been adequately studied.The study cohort included 308 consecutive patients presenting with a new-onset seizure, both acute symptomatic or unprovoked. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 (NCC group), those in whom imaging studies revealed active or inactive NCC (N = 184 (59.7%)) and group 2 (non-NCC group), those in whom either imaging was normal or revealed abnormalities other than NCC or the diagnosis was idiopathic generalized epilepsy (N = 124 (40.3%)).Clinical features significantly associated with group 1 included focal seizures (specifically, aphasic seizures (P < 0.05)), seizure clusters (P < 0.0001), postictal Todd's paresis (P < 0.05), and peri-ictal headaches (P < 0.008). In addition, somatosensory and visual seizures, and focal-clonic and focal-tonic were more frequent in this group. Generalized clonic seizures (P < 0.05) were significantly more common in the group 2. The findings of regional epileptiform abnormalities (P = 0.0001) and primary generalized epilepsy (P < 0.0001) on electroencephalography were significantly more common in group 2.In patients presenting with new-onset seizure, aphasic seizures, seizure clusters, postictal Todd's palsy and peri-ictal headaches might augur the finding of NCC, both active and inactive lesions, on imaging.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823725","annotations":[{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Paresis","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresis"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Aphasia","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.595307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.470521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Clonus","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonus"},{"name":"Partial seizure","weight":0.296898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_seizure"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.243798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Postictal state","weight":0.236437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postictal_state"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.174482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0671824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Augur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur"},{"name":"Neurocysticercosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocysticercosis"},{"name":"Idiopathic generalized epilepsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_generalized_epilepsy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
