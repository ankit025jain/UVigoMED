{"id":88324,"title":"Autologous fat grafting alleviates burn-induced neuropathic pain in rats.","abstract":"The management of neuropathic pain after burn injury is a critical clinical issue. Autologous fat grafting has been shown to alleviate neuropathic pain in certain cases, but has not been shown to alleviate the pain associated with burn-induced scars. The authors assessed the effectiveness of autologous fat grafting for the management of pain in burn-induced scars.One paw of the experimental rats received a third-degree burn using a heated metal block. Neuropathic pain in the affected paw was assessed based on behavioral responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. A graft (0.4 ml of autologous fat or a sham graft) was administered by injection to the burn scar and sham-burned paw. The animals were killed 4 weeks after the fat graft treatments; Masson trichrome stain of hind-paw skin and expression of phosphorylated p38 and OX42 in the dorsal horns of the spinal cords were examined.The third-degree burns were completely healed at 4 weeks. Burn-induced scarring caused mechanical allodynia and increased the expression of phosphorylated p38 and OX42 in spinal cord dorsal horn microglial cells. Autologous fat grafting significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia (p < 0.05), and immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of phosphorylated p38 and OX42 was significantly lower in spinal cord dorsal horn microglial cells 4 weeks after fat grafting (p < 0.05).Autologous fat grafting is used daily in clinical practice. It is an effective treatment for the relief of burn-induced mechanical allodynia in rats. Further investigation of the clinical use of autologous fat grafting in burn patients is warranted.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867722","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.53008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Microglia","weight":0.507173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Posterior horn of spinal cord","weight":0.381468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Allodynia","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allodynia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.28024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.274307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.263432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.105661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Fat transfer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_transfer"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Paw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
