{"id":31229,"title":"Generalized bullous fixed drug eruption is distinct from Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis by immunohistopathological features.","abstract":"Generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), a particular form of fixed drug eruption (FDE), is characterized by widespread blisters and erosions and can be confused with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).We sought to analyze specific features of GBFDE and differentiate it from SJS/TEN.We retrospectively studied patients with GBFDE and SJS/TEN during a period of 10Â years. GBFDE was defined as typical FDE lesions with blisters involving at least 10% body surface area on at least 3 of 6 different anatomic sites. Clinical presentations; histopathological features; immunohistochemical patterns of cluster-of-differentiation (CD)3, CD4, CD8, CD56, Fas, Fas ligand, granzyme B, perforin, granulysin, and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3); and serum granulysin levels were compared.Twenty-three cases of GBFDE were collected. Patients with GBFDE had shorter latent periods, less mucosal involvement, more eosinophil infiltration, and dermal melanophages. Lesional infiltrates in GBFDE had more dermal CD4(+) cells including Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, fewer intraepidermal CD56(+) cells, and fewer intraepidermal granulysin(+) cells. The serum level of granulysin in GBFDE was also significantly lower than in SJS/TEN.The number of cases in this study is small.GBFDE is a distinct disease distinguishable from SJS/TEN by particular features such as granulysin, CD56, and Foxp3 expressions.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388722","annotations":[{"name":"Perforin","weight":0.89709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforin"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Granulysin","weight":0.881091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulysin"},{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.780698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.705314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.675823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.642039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.55273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.552062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"GZMB","weight":0.505167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GZMB"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Blister","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"FOX proteins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOX_proteins"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"Toxic epidermal necrolysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Fixed drug reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"}]}
