{"id":88780,"title":"The posterior malleolar fracture: a parachute injury not to be overlooked.","abstract":"Isolated posterior tibial malleolar fracture, which concerns parachutists in particular, is rare and often overlooked. The present study sought to identify clinical and paraclinical factors able to improve diagnosis and treatment.Marginal posterior malleolar fracture is under-diagnosed due to lack of awareness and difficulty of diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis may impair functional prognosis.A multicenter retrospective study included 12 cases of isolated marginal posterior malleolar fracture in military parachutists between 2006 and 2011. Clinical and paraclinical data were collected from medical files and a questionnaire administered in consultation or by telephone.Diagnosis was initially overlooked in 75% of cases due to non-specific clinical presentation and the low sensitivity of plain radiographs. Diagnostic delay impaired functional outcome.Symptomatology, other than medial retromalleolar pain, is misleading. The Ottawa Ankle Rules should not be used in this particular form of trauma. X-ray should include a lateral view in 50Â° external rotation. CT provides a useful complement. Delayed diagnosis puts the patient at risk of impaired functional prognosis.IV (retrospective study).","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794499","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.520011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.314743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.163618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0471077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Ottawa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Plain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Malleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Parachute","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Posterior tibial vein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_tibial_vein"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
