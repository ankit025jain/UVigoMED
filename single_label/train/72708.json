{"id":72708,"title":"A Japanese region-wide survey of the knowledge, difficulties and self-reported palliative care practices among nurses.","abstract":"We investigated palliative care knowledge, difficulty and self-reported practice among a region-wide sample of nurses who cared for cancer patients in Japan.A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was distributed to 9 designated cancer centers, 17 community hospitals and 73 district nurse services across 4 regions in 2008. We used the Palliative Care Knowledge Test, the Palliative Care Difficulty Scale (five-point Likert scale) and the Palliative Care Self-Reported Practices Scale (five-point Likert scale).In total, 2378 out of 3008 nurses (79%) responded. The knowledge, difficulty and self-reported practice scores were 51 ± 20%, 3.2 ± 0.7 and 3.7 ± 0.6, respectively. In the knowledge test, philosophy scored highest (88 ± 26%) and psychiatric problems scored lowest (37 ± 29%). In the difficulty test, alleviating symptoms scored most difficult (3.5 ± 0.8) and providing expert support scored least difficult (2.9 ± 1.3). In the self-reported practice questionnaire, pain and delirium relief were most frequently (4.0 ± 0.8) and least frequently (3.1 ± 0.9) provided, respectively. Knowledge was significantly poorer in community hospitals (P = 0.035); difficulty scores were significantly higher in community hospitals (P < 0.001) and district nurse services (P = 0.013); and self-reported practice scores were significantly poorer in community hospitals (P < 0.001) but superior in district nurse services (P < 0.001) than in designated cancer centers.Knowledge, difficulty and self-reported practice for symptom management, particularly psychological symptoms, were insufficient, particularly in community hospitals. Education, expert support and adequate clinical experiences would help provide quality palliative care.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24948699","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.675619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.591172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Delirium","weight":0.564941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Philosophy","weight":0.421363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.241581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"District nurse","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_nurse"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
