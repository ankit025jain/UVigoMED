{"id":32601,"title":"Aortic arch advancement for aortic coarctation and hypoplastic aortic arch in neonates and infants.","abstract":"The optimal treatment for infants with aortic coarctation and hypoplastic aortic arch is controversial. The goal of this study was to report the short-term and mid-term outcomes of aortic arch advancement (AAA) in infants with hypoplastic aortic arch.All infants who underwent AAA at our institution from 1995 to 2012 were included. AAA consisted of coarctectomy and end-to-side anastomosis of the descending aorta to the distal ascending aorta/proximal arch through a median sternotomy. The cohort was divided into four groups: (1) isolated AAA (n=29, 11%), (2) AAA with closure of ventricular septal defect (n=56, 20%), (3) AAA with other biventricular repairs (n=115, 42%), and (4) AAA as part of single-ventricle palliation (n=75, 27%).The cohort included 275 patients: 125 (45%) were female, and the median age was 14 days (interquartile range, 7-34 days). Genetic abnormalities were present in 48 patients (17%). Neurologic adverse events occurred in 3 patients (1%), all in group 4. Left bronchial compression was seen in 2 patients (0.7%); only one required intervention. Vocal cord dysfunction was noted in 36 of 95 patients (38%) on routine laryngoscopy. Only 1 patient had clinical residual dysfunction at the last follow-up visit. Perioperative mortality was 3% (n=8). At a median follow-up time of 6 years, 8 patients (3%) had reinterventions at a median time of 5 months (3-17 months) after repair.AAA is a safe, effective, and durable operation with low rates of adverse events and mid-term reintervention. The advantages include native tissue-to-tissue reconstruction and preserved potential for growth. As such, it is the ideal technique for the management of hypoplastic aortic arch in neonates and infants.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
