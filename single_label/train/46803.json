However, acute pancreatitis from intra-articular injection of corticosteroid has never been described.A 69-year-old male presented with acute abdominal pain and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The patient had one episode of acute pancreatitis two year earlier. Both episodes occurred after intra-articular cortisone injection. Investigations for other causes of pancreatitis were negative.We report the first case of acute pancreatitis from intra-articular corticosteroid injection.
