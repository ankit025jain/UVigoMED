{"id":65152,"title":"Giant benign prostatic hyperplasia in a young adult male.","abstract":"A 27-year-old Caucasian male presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and hemospermia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a prostate of 180Â mL. The patient underwent open transvesical prostatic enucleation with preoperative and postoperative histopathologic examinations consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a very rare condition at this age group, with this patient being the youngest non-Asian confirmed case in the literature.
