{"id":67541,"title":"Effect of TLR4 and B7-H1 on immune escape of urothelial bladder cancer and its clinical significance.","abstract":"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and B7-H1, both normally expressed restricted to immune cells, are found to be aberrantly expressed in a majority of human tumors and may play important roles in regulation of tumor immunity. It has been shown that urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) patients can manifest tumoral immune escape which may be a potential critical factor in tumor pathogenesis and progression. However, so far, the mechanisms of UBC-related immune escape have not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TLR4 and B7-H1 on immune escape of UBC.Bladder cancer T24 cells were pre-incubated with LPS and co-cultured with tumor specific CTLs. CTL cytotoxicity and apoptosis rates were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The effects of an ERK inhibitor on B7-H1 expression and CTL cytotoxicity against T24 cells were also evaluated. In addition, TLR4, B7-H1 and PD-1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 60 UBC specimens and 10 normal urothelia.TLR4 activation protected T24 cells from CTL killing via B7-H1 overexpression. However PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, enhanced CTL killing of T24 cells by reducing B7-H1 expression. TLR4 expression was generally decreased in UBC specimens, while B7-H1 and PD-1 were greatly overexpressed. Moreover, expression of both B7-H1 and PD-1 was significantly associated with UICC stage and WHO grade classification.TLR4 and B7-H1 may contribute to immune escape of UBC. Targeting B7-H1 or the ERK pathway may offer new immunotherapy strategies for bladder cancer.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital
