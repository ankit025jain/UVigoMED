{"id":72166,"title":"Malignant round cell tumor of bone with EWSR1-NFATC2 gene fusion.","abstract":"Gene rearrangements involving the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) gene are seen in a broad range of sarcomas and some nonmesenchymal neoplasms. Ewing sarcoma is molecularly defined by a fusion of the EWSR1 gene (or rarely the related FUS gene) to a member of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family of transcription factors, frequently the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion. More recently, EWSR1 gene fusion to non-ETS family members, including the nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 2 (NFATC2) gene, has been reported in a histological variant of Ewing sarcoma. Here, we report a malignant round cell tumor of bone with an EWSR1-NFATC2 fusion gene. This report builds upon the unusual morphological and clinical presentation of bone neoplasms containing an EWSR1-NFATC2 fusion gene.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993903","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ewing's sarcoma","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing's_sarcoma"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.705167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1","weight":0.34211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing_sarcoma_breakpoint_region_1"},{"name":"ETS transcription factor family","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS_transcription_factor_family"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Breakpoint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint"},{"name":"Region 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_1"},{"name":"NFATC2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFATC2"},{"name":"FLI1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLI1"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy"},{"name":"Future and Freedom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_and_Freedom"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"FUS","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUS"}]}
