{"id":91096,"title":"Fracture of the radial styloid and concomitant first dorsal compartment musculotendinous injuries.","abstract":"In the absence of preexisting inflammatory conditions, pure traumatic rupture of the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL) tendons are rare injuries. We present a report of 2 cases of extensor tendon ruptures at the musculotendinous junction occurring after concomitant fractures of the radial styloid in patients who were involved in high-energy trauma. The presence of a radial styloid fracture should raise suspicion for a greater spectrum of injury that can contribute to multidirectional instability. The spectrum might even include proximal damage to the EPB and APL tendons. Although the associated tendon injuries might or might not contribute to functional loss, their presence should be noted when evaluating a patient with this injury pattern.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551866","annotations":[{"name":"Extensor pollicis brevis muscle","weight":0.917543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_pollicis_brevis_muscle"},{"name":"Abductor pollicis longus muscle","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductor_pollicis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.750671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.52345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.412099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tendinosis","weight":0.151377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinosis"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle","weight":0.118348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_brevis_muscle"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0334287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"APL (programming language)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Temporal styloid process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_styloid_process"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Ruptured spleen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruptured_spleen"}]}
