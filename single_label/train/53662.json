{"id":53662,"title":"Chronic dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition with sitagliptin is associated with sustained protection against ischemic left ventricular dysfunction in a pilot study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.","abstract":"The incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1, promotes myocardial glucose uptake and may improve myocardial tolerance to ischemia. Endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) is augmented by pharmacological inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4. We investigated whether chronic dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition by sitagliptin protected against ischemic left ventricular dysfunction during dobutamine stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.A total of 19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging on 2 separate occasions: the first (control) while receiving oral hypoglycemic agents, and the second after the addition of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) for ?4 weeks. Sitagliptin increased plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) levels and, at peak stress, enhanced both global (ejection fraction, 70.5±7.0 versus 65.7±8.0%; P<0.0001; mitral annular systolic velocity, 11.7±2.6 versus 10.9±2.3 cm/s; P=0.01) and regional left ventricular function, assessed by peak systolic velocity and strain rate in 12 paired, nonapical segments. This was predominantly because of a cardioprotective effect on ischemic segments (strain rate in ischemic segments, -2.27±0.65 versus -1.98±0.58 s(-1); P=0.001), whereas no effect was seen in nonischemic segments (-2.19±0.48 versus -2.18±0.54 s(-1); P=0.87). At 30 minutes recovery, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition mitigated the postischemic stunning seen in the control scan.The addition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor therapy with sitagliptin to the treatment regime of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease is associated with a sustained improvement in myocardial performance during dobutamine stress and a reduction in postischemic stunning.URL: http://www.isrctn.org.
