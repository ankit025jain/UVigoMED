{"id":87542,"title":"Acute fractures of the tarsal navicular.","abstract":"The tarsal navicular plays an integral role in hind-foot motion and gait, and is the keystone of the foot's medial longitudinal arch. As such, injuries to the navicular can be devastating. Acute avulsion, tuberosity, and body fractures have been described. Fractures of the body result from high-energy trauma and are often seen in conjunction with additional ipsilateral foot injuries. Plain radiographs are the gold standard for diagnosis, with computed tomography helpful in the presence of intra-articular fracture extension. Non-operative treatment is reserved for avulsion injuries and non-displaced body fractures. Open reduction and internal fixation must be performed for all other types, as failure to achieve an anatomic reduction can impede proper locomotion. Complications following operative intervention include pain, stiffness, posttraumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, nonunion, and hindfoot deformity.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102497","annotations":[{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.77453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Avulsion fracture","weight":0.723542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Navicular bone","weight":0.577738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navicular_bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.487055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.377765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Animal locomotion","weight":0.212081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.122913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Lameness (equine)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lameness_(equine)"},{"name":"Tubercle (anatomy)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Arches of the foot","weight":0.0206891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arches_of_the_foot"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Avulsion injury","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_injury"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"}]}
