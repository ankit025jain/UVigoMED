{"id":60376,"title":"Relatively restricted migration of polyclonal IgG4 may mimic a monoclonal gammopathy in IgG4-related disease.","abstract":"IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an increasingly recognized syndrome of unknown etiology that can affect a wide variety of organs. The commonly shared features include tumor-like swelling of the involved organs, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched with polyclonal IgG4-positive plasma cells, variable degree of fibrosis, and elevated serum concentrations of polyclonal IgG4.In a qualitative retrospective study, the electrophoretic characteristics of serum from patients with increased polyclonal IgG4 were studied to see if a reproducible pattern could be identified.We demonstrate that a characteristic focal band bridging the ? and ? fraction by serum protein electrophoresis may be a first serologic indication for IgG4-RD. We further demonstrate that significant ?:? skewing can occur in the polyclonal IgG4 fraction.The focal band detected by electrophoresis in sera from patients with IgG4-RD can be confirmed as polyclonal by immunofixation or immunosubtraction. Because these bands may be predominately of one light chain isotype, they could be misinterpreted as monoclonal gammopathies.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926089","annotations":[{"name":"Serum protein electrophoresis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.769776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.741196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Protein electrophoresis","weight":0.637993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.548379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.470553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.468879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.0634428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Isotype (immunology)","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(immunology)"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
