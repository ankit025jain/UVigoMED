{"id":62984,"title":"Essential role of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex in lymphoma revealed by rare germline polymorphisms.","abstract":"Constitutive activation of NF-?B is a hallmark of the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), owing to upstream signals from the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MYD88 pathways. The linear polyubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear polyubiquitin chains to I?B kinase-?, a necessary event in some pathways that engage NF-?B. Two germline polymorphisms affecting the LUBAC subunit RNF31 are rare among healthy individuals (?1%) but enriched in ABC DLBCL (7.8%). These polymorphisms alter RNF31 ?-helices that mediate binding to the LUBAC subunit RBCK1, thereby increasing RNF31-RBCK1 association, LUBAC enzymatic activity, and NF-?B engagement. In the BCR pathway, LUBAC associates with the CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 adapter complex and is required for ABC DLBCL viability. A stapled RNF31 ?-helical peptide based on the ABC DLBCL-associated Q622L polymorphism inhibited RNF31-RBCK1 binding, decreased NF-?B activation, and killed ABC DLBCL cells, credentialing this protein-protein interface as a therapeutic target.We provide genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence that the LUBAC ubiquitin ligase is a therapeutic target in ABC DLBCL, the DLBCL subtype that is most refractory to current therapy. More generally, our findings highlight the role of rare germline-encoded protein variants in cancer pathogenesis.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491438","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Ubiquitin","weight":0.748124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.737297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.635415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Ubiquitin ligase","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.604271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.558338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.527217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.478588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.465761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.355833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.339606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"BCR gene","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCR_gene"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Constitutive equation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equation"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"CARD domain","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARD_domain"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"}]}
