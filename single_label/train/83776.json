{"id":83776,"title":"Anti-inflammatory effects of Polygonum minus (Huds) extract (Lineminusâ„¢) in in-vitro enzyme assays and carrageenan induced paw edema.","abstract":"The study was aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Polygonum minus (Huds) using in vitro and in vivo approaches.The in vitro tests used to evaluate ethanolic extract are cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipooxygenase (5-LOX), secretory phospholipase-A2 (sPLA2) inhibition assay whilst the in-vivo effect was measured by the ability of aqueous extracts to reduce paw edema induced by ?-carrageenan, in rats.The ethanolic extract inhibited the activities of 5-LOX and COX-1(p?<?0.05) whilst the inhibitory effect on COX-2 was only moderate. A marked inhibition of 5-LOX was observed at 30 ?g/ ml. The extract did not inhibit the activity of sPLA2. The ability of the ethanolic extracts of Polygonum minus to inhibit both 5-LOX and COX, prompted a study to evaluate the effects of using an aqueous extract of Polygonum minus(LineminusTM); as this would be more suitable for future clinical testing. The anti-inhibitory activity of the aqueous extract from this plant was evaluated using a rat model where inflammation was induced in the paws by injection of ?-carrageenan. The aqueous extracts from Polygonum minus administered at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), significantly (p?<?0.01) reduced paw edema induced by ?-carrageenan in the experimental model, at 4 h compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, administration of 100 mg/kg b.w. or 300 mg/kg b.w. completely reduced inflammation of the paw 4 h after injection.These findings suggest that aqueous extract of Polygonum minus possesses potent anti-inflammatory activities.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252832","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.779805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.597988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Carrageenan","weight":0.568667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.541879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.309997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Polygonum","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonum"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Paw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw"},{"name":"Chromosome 1 (human)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_1_(human)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
