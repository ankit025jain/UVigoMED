{"id":27470,"title":"[The current classification of systemic vasculitides].","abstract":"Systemic vasculitides (SV) are severe multiorgan diseases whose early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve prognosis. Improving the classification of SV may lead to a significant reduction in the likelihood of diagnostic errors. The presented paper deals with the results of the International Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of SV (Chappel Hill, USA) in 2012. The nomenclature and definitions of the major forms of SV were revised and additional categories of vasculitis were included into the classification, by relying on the current trends in the practical use of terms, on the current ideas on the specific features of manifestations of diseases, and on achievements in studying the pathogenesis.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026809","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.425618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.227058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Nomenclature","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Chappel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappel"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
