{"id":4357,"title":"[Enolase and parasitic infection].","abstract":"Enolase is one kind of important glycolytic enzymes which widely exists in most organisms. A number of recent studies confirm that this enzyme has the functions of activating the plasminogen, involving in the processes of infection and migration of parasites, reducing the immune function of the host as well as preventing parasites from the immune attack of the host. This paper reviews the current research advances in the parasite enolase, and explores its potential for diagnosis, drug development and vaccine target of parasitic diseases.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434150","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.661523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Parasitic disease","weight":0.349716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.301787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"List of human parasitic diseases","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_parasitic_diseases"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
