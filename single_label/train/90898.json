{"id":90898,"title":"Neuropsychological and physiological correlates of fatigue following traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"Fatigue is a common and debilitating phenomenon experienced by individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) that can negatively influence rate and extent of functional recovery by reducing participation in brain injury rehabilitation services and increasing maladaptive lifestyle practices. The underlying mechanisms of TBI-related fatigue are not entirely understood and focused research on symptom reduction or prevention is limited.The current review of the literature suggests that the aetiology of TBI-related fatigue can be viewed as a multifactorial and complex model impacting physiological systems (i.e. endocrine, skeletal muscle and cardiorespiratory) that can be directly or indirectly influenced by neuropsychological correlates including cognitive and psychological impairment. Distinguishing central from peripheral fatigue is helpful in this regard. Potential therapeutic strategies and pharmacological agents to help alleviate fatigue in this patient population are discussed.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564698","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Physical medicine and rehabilitation","weight":0.724962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.682355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.659496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.618673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.470625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.155517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.100841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0868331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"}]}
