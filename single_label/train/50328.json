{"id":50328,"title":"The role of the community nurse in psoriatic comorbidities interventions.","abstract":"Psoriasis is a chronic disease that affects more than the skin. It has an impact on every facet of an individual's life and is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, depression, anxiety and other immune-related conditions, such as Crohn's disease. Obesity is inextricably linked with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are precursors for myocardial infarction and stroke. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, inadequate nutrition and physical exercise are behaviours that need to be addressed. With the right education from the community nurse, patients can be informed about the decisions they make and can ultimately choose to live a healthier life.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800325","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.815853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.809667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.808041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.756556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.584836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.55473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.547654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.479371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.370748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Psoriatic arthritis","weight":0.20457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriatic_arthritis"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.159096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
