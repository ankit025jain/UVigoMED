{"id":72208,"title":"[Application value of preoperative embolization in primary retroperitoneal tumor].","abstract":"To evaluate the value of angiography in clarifying the origin of the feeding arteries of primary retroperitoneal tumors and to explore the application of embolization therapy in the treating of primary retroperitoneal tumor.68 patients with primary retroperitoneal tumor were randomized into conventional tumor resection group (n = 35) and the preoperative embolization group (n = 33). Some clinical data were compared between the preoperative embolization group and the routine operation group, including blood loss, blood transfusion, operation time and adverse reactions after embolization. All the diagnoses were pathologically confirmed. The origins of the tumor-feeding arteries were analyzed. The clinical value of embolization in assisting the surgery as well as in making prognosis was assessed.According to their location and size, primary retroperitoneal tumors had feeding arteries from different origins. In this series of cases the tumor blood supply originated from the lumbar artery (81.8%), internal iliac artery (45.5%) and adrenal artery (27.3%). In the preoperative embolization group and conventional surgery group, the blood loss was 912 ml vs. 2 500 ml (P < 0.001), the blood transfusion was 1 000 ml vs. 2 600 ml (P < 0.001), the operation time was 4.1 h vs. 5.9 h (P < 0.001), and the length of hospital stay was 12.5 d vs. 19.8 d (P < 0.001).The origins of the feeding arteries in primary retroperitoneal tumors are very complex. Preoperative embolization therapy may effectively reduce the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative adverse events, length of hospital stay, and facilitate the patients' recovery.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989920","annotations":[{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.81272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.660011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.645652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.442287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Internal iliac artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_iliac_artery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0184033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"}]}
