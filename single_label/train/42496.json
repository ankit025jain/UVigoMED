{"id":42496,"title":"Science to practice: percutaneous biopsies in the NIR future--will fluorescence guide the way?","abstract":"Sheth et al present a fascinating glimpse into the future of imaging-guided biopsies. Increasingly, such biopsies are being performed by fusing two or more modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US). To this list should be added optical fluorescence guidance, which will complement all the advances hitherto developed for conventional imaging guidance. Similar progress is being made in the fields of endoscopy and surgery, and it is becoming clearer that optical fluorescence may light the path for many medical procedures in the \"NIR,\" or near-infrared, future.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848955","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.745947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.707504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.625719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.477076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Modal logic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Sheth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheth"},{"name":"Image-guided radiation therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-guided_radiation_therapy"}]}
