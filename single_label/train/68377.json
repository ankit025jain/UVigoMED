{"id":68377,"title":"Travel distance and home dialysis rates in the United States.","abstract":"?Rural residence is associated with increased peritoneal dialysis (PD) utilization. The influence of travel distance on rates of home dialysis utilization has not been examined in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine whether travel distances to the closest home and in-center hemodialysis (IHD) facilities are a barrier to home dialysis. ?This was a retrospective cohort study of patients aged ? 18 years initiating dialysis between 2005 and 2011. Unadjusted PD and home hemodialysis (HHD) rates were compared by travel distances to both the closest home dialysis and closest IHD facilities. Adjusted PD and HHD utilization rates were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. ?There were 98,608 patients in the adjusted analyses. 55.5% of the dialysis facilities offered home dialysis. IHD, PD and HHD patients traveled median distances of 5.4, 3.5 and 6.6 miles respectively to their initial dialysis facilities. Unadjusted analyses showed an increase in PD rates and decrease in HHD rates with increased travel distances. Adjusted odds of PD and HHD were 1.6 and 1.2 respectively for a ten mile increase in distance to the closest home dialysis facility, while for distances to the closest IHD facility the odds ratios for both PD and HHD were 0.7 (all p < 0.01). ?In metropolitan areas, PD and HHD generally increased with increased travel distance to the closest home dialysis facility and decreased with greater distance to an IHD facility. Examination of travel distances to PD and HHD facilities separately may provide further insight on specific barriers to these modalities which can serve as targets for future studies examining expansion of home dialysis utilization.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525595","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.616385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Incircle and excircles of a triangle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incircle_and_excircles_of_a_triangle"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Peritoneal dialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_dialysis"},{"name":"Home hemodialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_hemodialysis"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Mile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Human Rights Association (Turkey)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Association_(Turkey)"}]}
