{"id":68783,"title":"Successful treatment of extreme hyponatremia in an anuric patient using continuous venovenous hemodialysis.","abstract":"Rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can result in osmotic demyelination syndrome. Patients with severe hyponatremia and renal failure requiring dialysis pose a therapeutic challenge since the use of conventional intermittent hemodialysis will result in a rapid correction of the serum sodium level. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with extreme hyponatremia and severe acute kidney injury, who was successfully treated with continuous venovenous hemodialysis using a modified dialysate solution with a low sodium concentration that was adjusted on a daily basis.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496199","annotations":[{"name":"Hyponatremia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Demyelinating disease","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demyelinating_disease"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.707697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Anuria","weight":0.297914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuria"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.291471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Central pontine myelinolysis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pontine_myelinolysis"}]}
