{"id":56063,"title":"Parental age-related risk of retinoblastoma in Iranian children.","abstract":"Retinoblastoma is a rare malignant intraocular neoplasm. About 90% of cases feature a germline mutation in the RB1 gene and these will develop retinoblastoma during their early childhood. An association between mutations in germline cells and aging has been demonstrated. This suggests a higher incidence of childhood cancer including retinoblastoma among children of older parents.In the present study we aimed to determine the association of paternal and maternal age with an increased risk of retinoblastoma in a case-control study in Iranian population. The study was carried out on 240 persons who were born during 1984-2012 in Mahak and Mofid hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The statistical analysis included studying the mean age of parents and in order to know whether parental age of patients is different from parental age of control group, (t-test) compare averages test is used perfectly. By binary logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.The results of statistical analysis including the study of mean parental age by the use of (t-test) compare averages test showed a significant difference between parental ages of patients and controls. Logistic regression showed that coefficients were significant for maternal but not paternal age.Our findings indicate that advanced maternal age can increase the risk of retinoblastoma in offspring, but the paternal age has no significant effect.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761912","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Germline mutation","weight":0.678221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.597719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.566711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma","weight":0.374485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.297796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Advanced maternal age","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.269419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.216946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Paternal age effect","weight":0.132827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternal_age_effect"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.0530024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tehran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Logistic distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma protein","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma_protein"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"}]}
