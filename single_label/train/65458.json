{"id":65458,"title":"[Role of local radiotherapy after prostatectomy].","abstract":"Different risk factors of biochemical relapse after prostatectomy have been identified: extra-capsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and/or involved surgical margin. There is enough evidence in the literature that post-operative adjuvant radiation therapy can improve five and ten years local control rate, disease free survival and metastasis-free survival. Nevertheless, radiotherapy treatment is linked to a low risk of low grade toxicity and only 20-40% of biochemical relapse are observed after prostatectomy even if there is one involved surgical margin. So, it could be reasonable to propose a close monitoring of the PSA (\"Prostate Specific Antigen\") and adjuvant radiotherapy once the PSA is superior to 0 ng/ml. Rising PSA superior to 0.2 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy, corresponding to biochemical recurrence, is defined as a local relapse when the biochemical relapse is late and the PSA doubling time is superior to 6 months. Then, salvage radiotherapy is effective and has to be proposed taking the age of the patient, his comorbidities and his desires in consideration.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822302","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.904407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Seminal vesicle","weight":0.82491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicle"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.739713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.660895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.640326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.558498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Doubling time","weight":0.361086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_time"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.346269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Surgical margin","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_margin"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Libido","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"2040","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2040"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"Variety store","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_store"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"List of grape diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_diseases"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
