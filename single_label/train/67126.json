{"id":67126,"title":"[Bilateral ureterocele in single collection system: a particular case].","abstract":"Ureterocele is an uncommon congenital urinary tract malformation, which consists in a cystic dilation of the vesical portion of the ureter. We present a rare case of ureterocele, reviewing the most important aspects and characteristics that make it so unusual.Seven year old male admitted for hematuria in the context of afebrile urinary tract infection, the ultrasound revealed a right hydroureteronephrosis (HUN) in a single collecting system and a voiding cystourethogram (VCUG) showed a right ureterocele. A cystoscopy demonstrated the presence of a bilateral orthotopicureterocele in a single collecting system. The patient underwent an endoscopic incision in order to drain the hydronephrotic system. After a month, while performing a check up using ultrasound, we could observe an important reduction in the right HUN, however, it also was acknowledged the presence of dilation of the left distal ureter, reason why it was decided to puncture the left ureterocele.We present an unusual case: male with a bilateral orthotopicureterocele in a single collecting system and its clinical management. Its particularity is discussed.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645246","annotations":[{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Cystoscopy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.865408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.525466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.21786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ureterocele","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureterocele"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
