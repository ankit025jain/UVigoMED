{"id":11828,"title":"Unique presentation of normolipaemic cutaneous xanthoma in a cat.","abstract":"A normolipaemic 7-year-old female spayed Domestic Shorthair was initially presented with a history of pruritus for several years and diagnosed with concurrent atopic dermatitis, flea bite hypersensitivity and adverse food reaction. The hypersensitivities were controlled with cyclosporin, allergen-specific immunotherapy, topical flea control and a restricted diet. Five months after initial presentation, the cat developed a non-healing nodular ulcerated cutaneous lesion in the left axilla and also developed immune-mediated haemolytic anaemic (IMHA). The IMHA was stabilised, but the axillary lesion persisted and progressed to a diffuse, firm, yellowed subcutaneous swelling over the ventral body approximately 20 months later. Histopathology was consistent with cutaneous xanthoma. The cat was normolipaemic and being fed a home-prepared diet of lean kangaroo meat and pumpkin to manage pruritus associated with adverse food reactions. No underlying malignancy was detected on routine screening tests.A diffuse, planar form of cutaneous xanthoma occurring without associated lipaemia has not been previously reported in cats.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571300","annotations":[{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.816363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.807764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.794441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.74408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Flea","weight":0.639625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.57761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.482162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.290072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Ventral","weight":0.239576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Neutering","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering"},{"name":"Kangaroo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo"},{"name":"Xanthoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthoma"},{"name":"Pumpkin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Spider bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_bite"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
