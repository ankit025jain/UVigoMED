{"id":84399,"title":"Risk factors for erosion of artificial urinary sphincters: a multicenter prospective study.","abstract":"To evaluate the short- to medium-term outcomes after artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement from a large, multi-institutional, prospective, follow-up study. We hypothesize that along with radiation, patients with any history of a direct surgery to the urethra will have higher rates of eventual AUS explantation for erosion and/or infection.A prospective outcome analysis was performed on 386 patients treated with AUS placement from April 2009 to December 2012 at 8 institutions with at least 3 months of follow-up. Charts were analyzed for preoperative risk factors and postoperative complications requiring explantation.Approximately 50% of patients were considered high risk. High risk was defined as patients having undergone radiation therapy, urethroplasty, multiple treatments for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture, urethral stent placement, or a history of erosion or infection in a previous AUS. A total of 31 explantations (8.03%) were performed during the follow-up period. Overall explantation rates were higher in those with prior radiation and prior UroLume. Men with prior AUS infection or erosion also had a trend for higher rates of subsequent explantation. Men receiving 3.5-cm cuffs had significantly higher explantation rates than those receiving larger cuffs.This outcomes study confirms that urethral risk factors, including radiation history, prior AUS erosion, and a history of urethral stent placement, increase the risk of AUS explantation in short-term follow-up.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109562","annotations":[{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.879262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.823761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.682687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.662117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.537049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.524083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.432977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.396679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.299306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.181638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"History","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Neck of urinary bladder","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_of_urinary_bladder"}]}
