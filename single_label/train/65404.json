{"id":65404,"title":"[Efficacy observation on benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with acupuncture and moxibustion].","abstract":"To compare the difference in the clinical efficacy on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) between the acupuncture-moxibustion therapy and the medication of Qianliekang tablets.One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized into an acupuncture-moxibustion group and a Qianliekang group, 64 cases in each one. In the acupuncture-moxibustion group, acupuncture was applied to Shenshu (BL 23), Pangguangshu (BL 28), Zhongji (CV 3), Guanyuan (CV 4) and Shuidao (ST 28), and the warm moxibustion therapy with moxa stick was used at Shenshu (BL 23), Guanyuan (CV 4) and Shenque (CV 8), once every day. In the Qianliekang group, Qianliekang tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 4 tablets each time, three times a day, for 3 months. The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and the changes in residual urine (Ru) and maximal urine flow rate (Qmax) determined with the ultrasonic B test were compared before and after treatment in the two groups.The results of I-PSS, Qmax and Ru were improved obviously after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (all P < 0.05). The improvements in the acupuncture-moxibustion group were much more obvious than those in the Qianliekang group [8.62 +/- 2.18 vs 15.26 +/- 2.81, (16.04 +/- 4.33) mL/s vs (12.47 +/- 2.13) mL/s, (10.43 +/- 2.14) mL vs (32.13 +/- 3.24) mL, all P < 0.01]. The total effective rate was 89.1% (57/64) in the acupuncture-moxibustion group, which was better than 68.7% (44/64) in the Qianliekang group.Acupuncture-moxibustion therapy achieves the significant efficacy on BPH, which is better than the oral administration of Qianliekang tablets.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843963","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.234943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"The International (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(film)"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Urine flow rate","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_flow_rate"},{"name":"Ruthenium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenium"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Group 8 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_8_element"}]}
