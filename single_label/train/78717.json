{"id":78717,"title":"Long term results of childhood dysphonia treatment.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the long term results of treatment and rehabilitation of childhood dysphonia.This study included a group of adolescents (n=29) aged from 15 to 20 who were treated due to pediatric hyperfunctional dysphonia and soft vocal fold nodules during their pre-mutational period (i.e. between 5 and 12 years of age). The pre-mutational therapy was comprised of proper breathing pattern training, voice exercises and psychological counseling. Laryngostroboscopic examination and perceptual analysis of voice were performed in each patient before treatment and one to four years after mutation was complete. The laryngostroboscopic findings, i.e. symmetry, amplitude, mucosal wave and vocal fold closure, were graded with NAPZ scale, and the GRBAS scale was used for the perceptual voice analysis.Complete regression of the childhood dysphonia was observed in all male patients (n=14). Voice disorders regressed completely also in 8 out of 15 girls, but symptoms of dysphonia documented on perceptual scale persisted in the remaining seven patients.Complex voice therapy implemented in adolescence should be considered as either the treatment or preventive measure of persistent voice strain, especially in girls.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594230","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Speech and language pathology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.594074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.33779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.207256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.125004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"List of voice disorders","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_voice_disorders"},{"name":"Vocal fold nodule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_fold_nodule"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
