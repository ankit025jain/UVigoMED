{"id":26002,"title":"Endothelial progenitor cells in clinical settings.","abstract":"Senescence of cells is associated with shortened or damaged telomeres and is characterized by permanent exit from the cell cycle and altered function. Cellular senescence is caused by repeated cell division, and also conditions of stress including inflammation and reactive oxygen species can lead to the development of premature senescence. At the cellular level, proliferative and oxidative-stress induced cell senescence related to a pro-inflammatory state might strongly contribute to age-associated impaired tissue and organ functions. Vascular cells (endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells) and bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells have been repeatedly shown to have pivotal role in the maintenance and regeneration of cardiovascular tissue. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of vascular cell senescence have been extensively studied. However, therapeutic approaches to prevent cellular senescence in cardiovascular disease (CVD) are still limited. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are all potent angiogenic growth factors in animal models of ischemia, but their therapeutic effects are not the same in animal experiments and clinical trials. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial in Japan and a US phase II clinical trial of HGF gene therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI) demonstrated a significant improvement in primary end points and an increase in transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen even after one year compared with placebo, whereas effectiveness of VEGF and FGF treatment for CLI has not yet been shown. Moreover, our recent publication and another researcher demonstrated that HGF acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, while VEGF and FGF act as pro-inflammatory cytokine. This review overviews the outcomes of clinical trials using angiogenic growth factors, which have shown a dramatic effect in several animal studies. Additionally, interventions with HGF aimed at improving the regenerative capacity of stem/progenitor cells and vascular cells by preventing cellular senescence are discussed.
