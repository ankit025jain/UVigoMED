{"id":42499,"title":"Evaluation of lateral pelvic nodes in patients with advanced rectal cancer.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis as a predictor of local recurrence and survival in patients with advanced rectal cancer.Prediction of lateral pelvic nodal staging on MRI shows high accuracy compared with the other imaging modalities. Diffusion-weighted MRI or (18)F-FDG PET/CT may be helpful to assesses lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848821","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.478001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.464956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.345403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.316807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Node (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(physics)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
