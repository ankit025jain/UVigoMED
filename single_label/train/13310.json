{"id":13310,"title":"Treatment with atacicept enhances neuronal cell death in a rat model of optic neuritis.","abstract":"We investigated the effect of atacicept, a recombinant fusion protein blocking BLyS and APRIL and acting on B cells, on degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We used myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in Brown Norway rats to induce a variant of EAE which involves B cells and leads to severe optic neuritis. Intraperitoneal treatment with atacicept at some of the studied dose levels (100 or 200 ?g) resulted in increased apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells whereas at a tenfold lower dose or in vehicle-treated animals no such effect became apparent. Also the extent of inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss of the optic nerve was more pronounced in rats treated with the higher atacicept dose level. The present study describes observational evidence for adverse effects of atacicept on neuronal survival during EAE.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal
