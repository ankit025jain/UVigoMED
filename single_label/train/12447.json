{"id":12447,"title":"Protection to homologous and heterologous challenge in pigs immunized with vaccine against foot-and-mouth disease type O caused an epidemic in East Asia during 2010/2011.","abstract":"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious infectious disease, and the use of vaccines is known to be effective for its prevention. In 2010/2011, there was an epidemic of the South East Asia (SEA) topotype in East Asian countries. We adapted the SEA topotype virus isolated in November 2010 in Korea in cells to analyze the characteristics of the virus and evaluate its possibility as a vaccine. After cell culture adaptation, the FMD virus particle 146S was purified to develop an inactivated oil vaccine for SEA or other topotypes. To measure its immunogenicity, pigs were inoculated with the experimental vaccine at different concentrations of the antigen. The results indicated that the groups immunized with at least 7.5 ?g antigen were protected from homologous challenge. The immunized pigs were also protected against heterologous virus (ME-SA topotype) challenge. The genetic variations between the two field isolates and the adapted vaccine strains were identified in six amino acids by complete genome sequencing.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal
