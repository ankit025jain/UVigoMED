{"id":42102,"title":"Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and primary closure of choledochotomy after failed endoscopic sphincterotomy.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and primary closure of choledochotomy for the patients with common bile duct stones (CBDS) who failed in endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST).Between January 2007 and June 2012, a total of 78 patients who subjected to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and EST, but failed in endoscopic stone extraction, were referred to us. The following day, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) and primary closure of choledochotomy were performed in all patients.No intraoperative complications were experienced in the patients. 6 patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy due to impacted stones. The mean operative time was 145 min. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6d. All the patients achieved successful stone clearance. 13 cases had slight bile leaks, which resolved spontaneously. None of the patients experienced biliary peritonitis, biliary fistula, pancreatitis, or cholangitis.If it is performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, primary closure following immediate laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is safe and feasible for patients with CBDS who fail in endoscopic stone extraction.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879343","annotations":[{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.682766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"},{"name":"Biliary fistula","weight":0.526686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_fistula"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.174062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Anal sphincterotomy","weight":0.160706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sphincterotomy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"News leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Sixpence (British coin)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixpence_(British_coin)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"}]}
