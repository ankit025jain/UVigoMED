{"id":68670,"title":"Intraoperative segmentation of iodine and palladium radioactive sources in C-arm images.","abstract":"Dynamic dosimetry is becoming the standard to evaluate the quality of radioactive implants during brachytherapy. For this, it is essential to obtain a 3D visualization of the implanted seeds and their relative position to the prostate. A method was developed to obtain a robust and precise segmentation of seeds in C-arm images, and this approach was tested using clinical datasets.A region-based implicit active contour approach was used to delineate implanted seeds. Then, a template-based matching was employed to segment iodine implants whereas a K-means algorithm is implemented to resolve palladium seed clusters. To validate the method, 55 C-arm images from 10 patients were used for the segmentation of iodine sources, whereas 225 C-arm images from 16 patients were used for the palladium case.Compared to manual ground truth segmentation of 6,002 iodine seeds and 15,354 palladium seeds, 98.7 % of iodine sources were automatically detected and declustered showing a false-positive rate of only 1.7 %. A total of 98.7 % of palladium sources were automatically detected and declustered with a false-positive rate of only 2.0 %.An automated segmentation method was developed that is able to perform the identification and annotation processes of seeds on par with a human expert. This method was shown to be robust and suitable for integration in the dynamic dosimetry workflow of prostate brachytherapy interventions.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504857","annotations":[{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.157444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Visualization (computer graphics)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Palladium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium"},{"name":"Dosimetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry"},{"name":"Ground truth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_truth"},{"name":"Active contour model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_contour_model"},{"name":"Prostate brachytherapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_brachytherapy"},{"name":"Truth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Matching (graph theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)"},{"name":"Radioactive contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Contour line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Par (score)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Computer cluster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"},{"name":"Dynamic (record label)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_(record_label)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Annotation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"}]}
