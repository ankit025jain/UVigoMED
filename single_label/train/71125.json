{"id":71125,"title":"Oral epidermoid cyst. A case report.","abstract":"Paediatric epidermoid cysts are the rare lesions in the oral cavity, especially under the age of 10 years. They appear in the midline of the mouth usually as a result of residual ectodermal tissue of the first and second branchial arches, which fuse during the third and fourth weeks of intra-uterine life.We present a case of a male patient aged 8 years with swelling of the floor of the mouth, complaining of difficulty in swallowing. The ultrasonographic finding was infected ranula with a differential diagnosis of foregut duplication cyst and dermoid cyst. The cyst was surgically enucleated and was diagnosed as epidermoid cyst after histopathology. At the 18-month follow-up the cyst had not recurred.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101515","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Epidermoid cyst","weight":0.658714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermoid_cyst"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.376921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Dermoid cyst","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermoid_cyst"},{"name":"Branchial arch","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branchial_arch"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Gill","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Ranula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranula"},{"name":"Foregut","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foregut"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"}]}
