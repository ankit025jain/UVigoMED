{"id":91778,"title":"Delayed hypoglossal nerve palsy following unnoticed occipital condyle fracture.","abstract":"Occipital condylar fractures (OCFs) are rare and difficult to diagnose. The routine use of computed tomography (CT) scan in traumatology has however now made their diagnosis easier, with an estimated frequency of 4 to 19% of craniospinal traumatized patients and 0.4 to 0.7% of all severe traumatized patients in emergencies. This paper describes a patient who was not diagnosed with OCF during his first hospitalization after a road accident. However, 15 days later a left sided hypoglossal nerve palsy occurred. In this case report, we underline that an examination of the cranial nerve is a quick and easy procedure to screen each head trauma patient for occipital foramen fractures. Also, careful attention must be paid to X-Rays, CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging of the craniocervical junction.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475495","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cranial nerve","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerve"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.75602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.659065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.642546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Occiput","weight":0.47219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occiput"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.338155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Traumatology","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatology"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.293785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.243942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hypoglossal nerve","weight":0.185635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglossal_nerve"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Foramen","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Occipital condyle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_condyle"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
