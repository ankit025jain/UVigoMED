{"id":77229,"title":"The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its relationship with disease severity in an urban pediatric critical care unit.","abstract":"To evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients admitted to a Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PCCU) in an urban children's hospital, and to assess if there is a correlation between vitamin D level and disease severity.Patients (216) between the ages of 1-21 years admitted to the PCCU in a children's hospital, excluding those readmitted with a previous vitamin D level, were enrolled. Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were measured in all patients within 24 h of admission to the PCCU. The severity of patient illness was assessed by the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score determined on admission.Vitamin D deficiency was found in 28% of patients and vitamin D insufficiency was found in 47% of patients. Adolescent age group, female gender, Black race, winter season, and increasing BMI were determined to be risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency. No significant correlation was found between vitamin D level and PELOD score (p=0.09). There were six deaths (3%), 5 (83%) of which occurred in patients with low vitamin D levels. Total serum calcium levels correlated with vitamin D (p=0.005) and PELOD score (p=0.001). However, ionized calcium levels did not significantly correlate with vitamin D (p=0.62) or PELOD score (p=0.26).Vitamin D deficiency is common in children admitted to an urban inner city PCCU, with 75% of patients having abnormal levels. We did not find a significant correlation between disease severity as measured by PELOD score and vitamin D level in a heterogeneous group of critically ill children. Total serum calcium levels significantly correlated with vitamin D and disease severity in this population. There appears to be an association between vitamin D deficiency and mortality.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824802","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.795333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.48353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.481224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.369771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.346876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.299158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.288552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.270755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.127845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0340852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ohio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Inner city","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_city"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
