{"id":20246,"title":"The 'either test positive' strategy for latent tuberculous infection before anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment.","abstract":"A ttertiary referral centre in South Korea.The 'either test positive' strategy, incorporating both the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the T-SPOT(Â®).TB(T-SPOT) assay, was evaluated as a novel method for diagnosing latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) before treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.From June 2008 to April 2012, 430 patients received anti-TNF treatment at our institution. TST and T-SPOT were performed simultaneously at baseline. LTBI was defined as a positive TST or a positive T-SPOT result.The positivity rates for the TST and T-SPOT assays were respectively 19.1% (82/430) and 44.2% (190/430), yielding an LTBI-positive rate of 48.6% (209/430). LTBI treatment was initiated in 46.0% (198/430) of patients and was completed by 89.4% (177/198). During follow-up (median 884 days), 0.9% (4/430) of the patients developed active tuberculosis (TB). All four TB patients were TST-negative at baseline, although two received LTBI treatment based on the baseline positive T-SPOT assay results.The either test positive strategy is a valid method for diagnosing LTBI before anti-TNF treatment, although it is not clear whether it is superior to other strategies.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670697","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.784779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.575452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.430089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.39236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.0239641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"884","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/884"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"}]}
