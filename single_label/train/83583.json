{"id":83583,"title":"[Morbidity rate and mental capacity of Moscow schoolchildren (longitudinal study)].","abstract":"In the article there are presented data of longitudinal study of the health of Moscow schoolchildren (426 children), followed throughout from the 1st to 9th class, inclusively. Students were annually clinically examined in the school. There was performed a comprehensive study of mental health and functional state of the organism in the process of education students in high school (over 2700 pupils of 5-9th classes). The health status of students was shown to deteriorate due to the increase of the prevalence of chronic disease, the rise in occupancy of the III-IV health groups, the decrease of the number of children referred to I and II health groups. Unfavorable trends in the health state among boys are more pronounced than in girls, while they are also characterized by lower functional capabilities of the CNS and lower resistance to the development of training fatigue. Relatively favorable stage of school ontogeny is characterized by period with reduced morbidity in children studying in 4th-6th classes. Deterioration in the health of students as a significant rate of the rise of chronic diseases morbidity is observed in 7-9th classes. Along with this, in the 7th and 9th classes there is revealed the deterioration of mental capacity and high frequency of the pronounced signs of fatigue among schoolchildren.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306705","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.670025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.642891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.581946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"School","weight":0.458664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Ontogeny","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
