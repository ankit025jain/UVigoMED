{"id":77043,"title":"Parent skills training to enhance weight loss in overweight children: evaluation of NOURISH.","abstract":"Although there is general agreement that parents should be involved in pediatric obesity treatment, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of interventions that target parents exclusively. Moreover, the effectiveness of this approach has not been adequately assessed with racially diverse families, particularly African Americans(AA), a group at high risk for elevated Body Mass Index (BMI).NOURISH (Nourishing Our Understanding of Role modeling to Improve Support and Health) is a culturally-sensitive parenting intervention targeting overweight (AA) children (ages 6-11; MBMI = 98.0%ile). Families (N = 84; 61% AA, 37% White) were randomly assigned to NOURISH or a control group.NOURISH families significantly improved on child BMI from pre- to post-testing after adjustment for random effects, baseline BMI, and child race. NOURISH parents were very satisfied with the intervention and would recommend it to other parents; 91% strongly or moderately agreed that NOURISH helped them eat in a healthier manner.These pilot data suggest that NOURISH is acceptable and, with refinement, offers promise for reducing pediatric BMI. Outcomes, lessons learned, and parent feedback will inform a larger randomized controlled trial.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854808","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.729491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.636859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.273809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.161252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Parenting","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0827578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.0279886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"}]}
