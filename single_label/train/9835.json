{"id":9835,"title":"Stimulation of ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by AR-R17779 suppresses atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.","abstract":"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. It has been appreciated that vagus nerve inhibits macrophage activation via ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. We explored the effects of AR-R17779, a selective ?7nAChR agonist, on atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice. ApoE-deficient mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and angiotensin II (Ang II) was infused by osmotic minipumps from 10-week-old for 4weeks. AR-R17779 was given in drinking water ad libitum. Oil red O staining of the aorta showed that combined loading of HFD and Ang II induced marked atherosclerosis compared with control mice fed a normal chow. Treatment with AR-R17779 significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area and improved survival of mice. Treatment with AR-R17779 also suppressed abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. Quantitative RT-PCR of the aorta revealed that mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1?, interleukin-6 and NOX2 were significantly decreased in AR-R17779-treated mice compared with Ang II+HFD mice. AR-R17779 treatment also reduced blood pressure and serum lipid levels. In conclusion, ?7nAChR activation attenuates atherogenesis and aortic abdominal aneurysm formation in ApoE-deficient mice possibly through an anti-inflammatory effect and reduction of blood pressure and lipid levels. Pharmacological activation of ?7nAChR may have a therapeutic potential against atherosclerotic vascular diseases through multiple mechanisms.
