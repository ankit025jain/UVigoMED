{"id":57009,"title":"An analysis of Time 4U, a therapeutic group for women with postnatal depression.","abstract":"This article examines the effectiveness of the Time4U therapeutic group for women with postnatal depression, introduced seven years ago in Bury. The group is facilitated by a health visitor and primary care mental health nurse, and offers a combination of group therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, peer support and social support. This paper analyses the scores and evaluations of the mothers who attended in 2012 and shows that the mothers' depression, anxiety and social functioning improved. The reasons for the group's success are discussed and include partnership working between community services, primary mental health services and children's centres.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286739","annotations":[{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Postpartum depression","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.524285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Peer support","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_support"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.399516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.36731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.356942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Community mental health service","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_mental_health_service"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0502578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Health visitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_visitor"},{"name":"Community service","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service"},{"name":"Peerage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
