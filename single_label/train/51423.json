{"id":51423,"title":"Expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen in ovarian cancer and their relationship to drug resistance.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen in epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and its underlying clinical significance, and to analyze the correlation between the expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen. Ninety-two ovarian cancer patients were divided into a chemotherapeutic-drug-resistant group (34 patients) and a drug-sensitive group (58 patients). Immunohistochemical assays were used to measure CD147, and Lewis y antigen to investigate their correlation with chemotherapy resistance. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationships between risk factors and resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Cox's model was used to analyze the relationships between risk factors and prognosis. The proportion of tissues expressing CD147 and Lewis y antigen in the drug-resistant group were 94.12 and 91.67%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the sensitive group (77.59 and 60.34%, respectively). The multivariate analysis indicated that the expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen and the pathological stage of the ovarian cancer were all independent risk factors for drug resistance. Expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen was high in the resistant group, and they correlated positively with each other. The expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen was significantly higher in the drug-resistant group and their expression correlated positively in the ovarian epithelium. The expression of CD147 and Lewis y antigen and the pathological stage of ovarian cancer were all independent risk factors for drug resistance and prognosis in ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692145","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.741146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.735475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.709617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.599349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.526802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.464702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.461767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.398745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.388088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
