{"id":42516,"title":"[Neoplasic colonic obstruction: resolution with self-expanding metallic stents].","abstract":"The endoscopic placement of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) emerges as a therapeutic option for neoplastic colonic obstruction in two situations: as palliative treatment and as a bridge to surgery. The latter can avoid emergency surgery, thus decreasing the rate of ostomies and the mortality and morbidity associated with them.To evaluate the feasibility, safety and benefits of SEMS placement for the treatment of neoplastic colorectal obstruction.Between August 2008 and June 2012, we included in this prospective, longitudinal, descriptive and observational study all the patients suffering from colorectal neoplasia who were subjected to SEMS placement by the same group ofendoscopists. Nitinol SEMS were inserted under endoscopic vision and radioscopic control.Twenty seven SEMS were inserted in 27 patients, 61% of them were male and the average age was 70 years old. Symptoms of colonic suboclussion or obstruction were found in 92% of patients, 88% of the lesions were located in the left-side colon, 41% of cases were performed on an ambulatory basis and 65% of stenting was carried out for palliative purposes. The average time of hospitalization was 6,46 days. Technical and clinical success were 93% and 100%, respectively. Minor complications were observed in 11% of patients. Colonic stenting was followed by elective surgery within one month, by a laparoscopic technique in most cases.The placement of SEMS arises as a safe and effective alternative to palliative surgery or as a bridge to elective surgery.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847627","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stoma (medicine)","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.26758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.258384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.251248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Nickel titanium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_titanium"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
