{"id":10257,"title":"PTH [1-34]-induced alterations of the subchondral bone provoke early osteoarthritis.","abstract":"To test the hypothesis that changes in the subchondral bone induced by parathyroid hormone (PTH [1-34]) reciprocally affect the integrity of the articular cartilage within a naïve osteochondral unit in vivo.Daily subcutaneous injections of 10 ?g PTH [1-34]/kg were given to adult rabbits for 6 weeks, controls received saline. Blood samples were continuously collected to monitor renal function. The subchondral bone plate and subarticular spongiosa of the femoral heads were separately assessed by micro-computed tomography. Articular cartilage was evaluated by macroscopic and histological osteoarthritis scoring, polarized light microscopy, and immunohistochemical determination of type-I, type-II, type-X collagen contents, PTH [1-34] receptor and caspase-3 expression. Absolute and relative extents of hyaline and calcified articular cartilage layers were measured histomorphometrically. The correlation between PTH-induced changes in subchondral bone and articular cartilage was determined.PTH [1-34] enhanced volume, mineral density, and trabecular thickness within the subarticular spongiosa, and increased thickness of the calcified cartilage layer (all P < 0.05). Moreover, PTH [1-34] led to cartilage surface irregularities and reduced matrix staining (both P < 0.03). These early osteoarthritic changes correlated with and were ascribed to the increased thickness of the calcified cartilage layer (P = 0.026) and enhanced mineral density of the subarticular spongiosa (P = 0.001).Modifications of the subarticular spongiosa by PTH [1-34] cause broadening of the calcified cartilage layer, resulting in osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration. These findings identify a mechanism by which PTH-induced alterations of the normal subchondral bone microarchitecture may provoke early osteoarthritis.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Animal
