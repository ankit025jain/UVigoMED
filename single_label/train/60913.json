{"id":60913,"title":"Pretransplant comorbidities predict severity of acute graft-versus-host disease and subsequent mortality.","abstract":"Whether the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) can provide prognostic information about development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and subsequent mortality is unknown. Five institutions contributed information on 2985 patients given human leukocyte antigen-matched grafts to address this question. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazards of acute GVHD and post-GVHD mortality after adjustment for known risk variables. Higher HCT-CI scores predicted increased risk of grades 3 to 4 acute GVHD (P < .0001 and c-statistic of 0.64), and tests of interaction suggested that this association was consistent among different conditioning intensities, donor types, and stem cell sources. Probabilities of grades 3 to 4 GVHD were 13%, 18%, and 24% for HCT-CI risk groups of 0, 1 to 4, and ?5. The HCT-CI was statistically significantly associated with mortality rates following diagnosis of grade 2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24; P < .0001) or grades 3 to 4 acute GVHD (HR = 1.19; P < .0001). Patients with HCT-CI scores of ?3 who developed grades 3 to 4 acute GVHD had a 2.63-fold higher risk of mortality than those with scores of 0 to 2 and did not develop acute GVHD. Thus, pretransplant comorbidities are associated with the development and severity of acute GVHD and with post-GVHD mortality. The HCT-CI could be useful in designing trials for GVHD prevention and could inform expectations for GVHD treatment trials.
