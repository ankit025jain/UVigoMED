{"id":52702,"title":"Anti-diabetic effects of the Indian indigenous fruit Emblica officinalis Gaertn: active constituents and modes of action.","abstract":"Dietary constituents are shown to play an important role in the development of diabetes. Studies have shown that the fruits of Emblica officinalis Gaertn or Phyllanthus emblica Linn, colloquially known as Indian gooseberry or amla and/or some of its important constituents (including gallic acid, gallotanin, ellagic acid and corilagin), possess anti-diabetic effects through their antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. Amla has also been reported to prevent/reduce hyperglycemia, cardiac complications, diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, cataractogenesis and protein wasting. However, clinical trial data with human subjects are limited and preliminary. For the first time this review summarizes the anti-diabetic affects of amla and also addresses the mechanisms mediating these properties.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577384","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Diabetic nephropathy","weight":0.831158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ellagic acid","weight":0.793599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellagic_acid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.747012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.379345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Phyllanthus emblica","weight":0.366559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllanthus_emblica"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.204537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Wasting","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasting"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Gooseberry","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gooseberry"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Colloquialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
