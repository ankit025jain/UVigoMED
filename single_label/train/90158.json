{"id":90158,"title":"Reverse shoulder arthroplasty: radiological and clinical short-term results.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the radiological and clinical short term results of the patients who underwent reverse shoulder arthroplasty for rotator cuff arthropathy.The study included 14 (2 male, 12 female) patients who underwent reverse shoulder arthroplasty for rotator cuff arthropathy between 2009 and 2010. The mean age of the patients was 74 (57-80) years and the mean follow-up period was 32 (21-40) months. Radiological methods as well as the range of motion, Quick DASH, Constant and VAS scores were used for the evaluation of patients preoperatively and at last the follow-up.Mean active forward flexion, abduction and external rotation increased respectively from 44, 41 and 21 degrees preoperatively to 149, 105 and 37 degrees at the last follow-up. The mean Quick-Dash score was 59.1 degrees preoperatively, and 36.1 degrees at the last follow-up visit. The mean Constant score increased from 20.7 preoperatively to 58.9 at the last follow-up visit. The mean VAS score decreased from 7 preoperatively to 1.2 at the last follow-up visit. The mean acromion-humeral head distance increased from 5.3 mm preoperatively to 23.1 mm postoperatively. None of the patients had major complications.Reverse shoulder arthroplasty in patients with advanced stage rotator cuff tear arthropathy ensure significant improvement in terms of pain and function with the help of an appropriate rehabilitation protocol.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643096","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.662366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.474442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Yarkovsky effect","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect"},{"name":"Rotator cuff tear","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff_tear"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"2140s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2140s"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Newton's laws of motion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Arthropathy","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropathy"}]}
