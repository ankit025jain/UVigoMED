{"id":45944,"title":"Unmet needs and challenges in gastric cancer: the way forward.","abstract":"Although the incidence of gastric cancer has fallen steadily in developed countries over the past 50 years, outcomes in Western countries remain poor, primarily due to the advanced stage of the disease at presentation. While earlier diagnosis would help to improve outcomes for patients with gastric cancer, better understanding of the biology of the disease is also needed, along with advances in therapy. Indeed, progress in the treatment of gastric cancer has been limited, mainly because of its genetic complexity and heterogeneity. As a result, there is an urgent need to apply precision medicine to the management of the disease in order to ensure that individuals receive the most appropriate treatment. This article suggests a number of strategies that may help to accelerate progress in treating patients with gastric cancer. Incorporation of some of these approaches could help to improve the quality of life and survival for patients diagnosed with the disease. Standardisation of care across Europe through expansion of the European Registration of Cancer Care (EURECCA) registry - a European cancer audit that aims to improve quality and decrease variation in care across the region - may also be expected to lead to improved outcomes for those suffering from this common malignancy.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656602","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.723347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.700699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.395399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.328474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
