{"id":87231,"title":"[Repair of-limb soft tissue defect with free deep inferior epigastric perforator flap].","abstract":"To report the clinical application results of free deep inferior epigastric perforator flap in the repair of soft tissue defect.From January 2006 to January 2012,13 patients with soft tissue defect (7 cases in leg and 6 cases in forearm) underwent reconstruction with a free deep inferior epigastric perforator flap. There were 9 males and 4 females, aged from 21 to 45 years old with an average of 33 years. Soft tissue defect in the extremities were from 7 cm x 17 cm to 8 cm x 26 cm. The medial branch and lateral brangh flaps were 7 cases and 6 cases respectively. The donor site was closed directly.One patient developed small wound dehiscence, which spontaneous healed at one month after surgery. All the flaps had survived completely. Follow-up period ranged from 1.8 to 4.0 years with the mean of 2.8 years postoperatively. Satisfactory clinical results were obtained in 12 cases. A good contour was confirmed at the recipient area.The free deep inferior epigastric perforator flap for the extremities defects of soft tissue is a good option. This technique is safe and reliable, and can decrease the injury of donor site.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571663","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Adam Politzer","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Politzer"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"},{"name":"Inferior epigastric artery","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_epigastric_artery"}]}
