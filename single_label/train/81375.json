{"id":81375,"title":"Staged ridge splitting technique for horizontal expansion in mandible: a case report.","abstract":"Ridge split procedures are commonly performed for horizontal augmentation of narrow ridges which would otherwise preclude implant placement. A 47-year-old patient with bilaterally edentulous posterior mandibular ridges was treated in the Department of Periodontology and Implantology, M.A. Rangoonwala College of Dental Sciences and Research Centre, employing a \"staged ridge split\" technique. In this technique, a simple corticotomy at the crestal, apical, and lateral aspects of the buccal cortical plate of the mandible was performed. Following this, a month later, the ridge was expanded and bone graft OssiFi containing biphasic beta-tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyappatite was placed to maintain the gap between the cortices. Thereafter, implants were placed 3 months later. A successful prosthetic rehabilitation was done following a healing phase of 3 months. This approach leads to restoration of function with a predictable outcome and minimal risk of cortical plate fracture during the ridge expansion process.
