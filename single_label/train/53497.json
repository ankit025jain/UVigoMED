{"id":53497,"title":"?-Mangostin inhibits hypoxia-driven ROS-induced PSC activation and pancreatic cancer cell invasion.","abstract":"Recent advances indicating a key role of microenvironment for tumor progression, we investigated the role of PSCs and hypoxia in pancreatic cancer aggressiveness, and examined the potential protective effect of ?-mangostin on hypoxia-driven pancreatic cancer progression. Our data indicate that hypoxic PSCs exploit their oxidative stress due to hypoxia to secrete soluble factors favouring pancreatic cancer invasion. ?-Mangostin suppresses hypoxia-induced PSC activation and pancreatic cancer cell invasion through the inhibition of HIF-1? stabilization and GLI1 expression. Increased generation of hypoxic ROS is responsible for HIF-1? stabilization and GLI1 upregulation. Therefore, ?-mangostin may be beneficial in preventing hypoxia-induced pancreatic cancer progression.
