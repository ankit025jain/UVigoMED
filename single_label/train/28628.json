{"id":28628,"title":"The influence of parental divorce and alcohol abuse on adult offspring risk of lifetime suicide attempt in the United States.","abstract":"The influences of parental divorce and alcohol abuse on adult offspring lifetime suicide attempt have not been examined in national data. This study analyzed data from the 2001-2002 NESARC to estimate main and interaction effects of parental divorce and alcohol abuse on lifetime suicide attempt. Adjusted for controls, parental divorce and parental alcohol abuse independently increased odds of lifetime suicide attempt. The effect of parental divorce was not significantly moderated by parental alcohol abuse. Further research is needed to examine whether additional parental and offspring psychiatric and substance use covariates attenuate the association between parental divorce and lifetime suicide attempt.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827026","annotations":[{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Divorce","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.615743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.347172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.30613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Failed suicide attempt","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_suicide_attempt"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Interaction (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Usenet","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
