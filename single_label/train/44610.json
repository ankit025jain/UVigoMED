{"id":44610,"title":"Long-term follow-up and recurrence rate after mesorectum-sparing bowel resection among women with rectovaginal endometriosis.","abstract":"To demonstrate the quality of a combined vaginal-abdominal surgical approach to rectovaginal endometriosis by analyzing long-term outcome and recurrence rates.In a prospective cohort study in Berlin, Germany, women with endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum were enrolled between September 2004 and December 2012. Bowel infiltration was verified intraoperatively and treated by a nerve-sparing, mesentery-preserving vaginal-abdominal operative approach. Operative results were evaluated by assessing short- and long-term complications and recurrence rates.During the study period, 110 women underwent surgery. For 71 (64.5%) patients, bowel infiltration was confirmed intraoperatively. Overall, 15% of the patients had peri- or postoperative complications. No long-term complications occurred. After a median follow-up of 64 months, no recurrence in the rectovaginal septum was observed among the study patients. The recurrence of pelvic endometriosis was 15%.The surgical nerve-sparing approach to rectovaginal endometriosis was confirmed to facilitate precise diagnosis and treatment with minimal morbidity and a long-term complication rate of 0%.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726619","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.716602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.376853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Bowel resection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_resection"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Peri","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"}]}
