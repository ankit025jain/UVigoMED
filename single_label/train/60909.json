{"id":60909,"title":"Beyond the platelet count: immature platelet fraction and thromboelastometry correlate with bleeding in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"Platelet counts (PC) estimate bleeding risk in Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). We investigated whether measures of thromboelastometry and absolute immature platelet fraction (A-IPF) would correlate better with acute bleeding score (ABS) than PC or mean platelet volume (MPV). Simultaneous determination of ABS, complete blood count and thromboelastometry was performed in 141 ITP patients; 112 underwent A-IPF testing. Subgroup analyses were performed for paediatric subjects, PC <60 × 10(9) /l and <30 × 10(9) /l. PC significantly inversely correlated with ABS in all subjects, PC <30 × 10(9) /l and total paediatric cohort. MPV did not correlate with ABS in any subgroup. Thromboelastometry measures of clot firmness, but not PC, significantly correlated with ABS in all subjects with PC <60 × 10(9) /l, and children with PC <60 × 10(9) /l and <30 × 10(9) /l. A-IPF demonstrated stronger correlation with ABS than did PC among all subjects, those with PC <60 × 10(9) /l, all children and children with PC <30 × 10(9) /l (r = -0·37; r = -0·34; r = -0·44; r = -0·60) versus ABS with PC (r = -0·36; ns; r = -0·32; ns). Stronger correlations of both thromboelastometry measures of clot firmness and A-IPF than PC with ABS suggest factors beyond PC, i.e. related to platelet function, contribute to ITP bleeding pathophysiology. Thromboelastometry, A-IPF and ABS can be incorporated into routine or acute visits.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797389","annotations":[{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.813803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.670417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.277778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.235792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Thromboelastometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboelastometry"},{"name":"Nanosecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond"},{"name":"Anti-lock braking system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Minivan","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minivan"}]}
