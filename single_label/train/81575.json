{"id":81575,"title":"Prevalence of temporomandibular disorders symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in patients with the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS), the relationship between TMD and the severity of MS, and the presence of TMD symptoms in the evaluated groups. Sixty individuals were evaluated: 30 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS and 30 control individuals matched for gender and age range with no neurologic pathology. In order to investigate the TMD symptoms, the questionnaires of the EACD (European Academy of Craniomandibular Disorders) and the RDC/TMD (Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders), both validated for TMD research, were administered. To assess the extent of disability produced by MS, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used. The prevalence of TMD symptoms in patients with MS was 56.7% versus 16.7% for the control group, with a statistically significant difference between the groups (p=0.0016). No correlation was found between the severity of MS and the prevalence of TMD symptoms (Fisher's test, p=1.0).
