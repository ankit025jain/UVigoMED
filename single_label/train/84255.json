{"id":84255,"title":"Immunotherapy with B cell epitopes ameliorates inflammatory responses in Balb/c mice.","abstract":"Osmotin, a protein from the pathogenesis-related family (PR-5), has been identified as an allergen based on in-silico and in-vitro studies. In the present study, three B cell epitopes of osmotin with single and double amino acid modifications were studied for immunotherapy in a murine model. The single-modification peptides (P-1-1, P-2-1 and P-3-1) and double-modification peptides (P-1-2, P-2-2 and P-3-2) showed significantly lower immunoglobulin (Ig)E binding with patients' sera compared to osmotin (P < 0·01). These peptides showed reduced IgE binding compared to the unmodified peptides (B cell epitopes) P-1, P-2 and P-3. Among the modified peptides, P-2-1, P-3-1, P-2-2 and P-3-2 showed significant reduction in IgE binding and were used for immunotherapy in mice. The sera of mice group treated with peptides showed a significant increase in IgG2a level and a significant decrease in IgE and IgG1 levels (P < 0·05). The mice that received peptide immunotherapy showed a shift from a T helper type 2 (Th2) to Th1 type where interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were elevated, with a significant increase in groups treated with peptides P-3-1 and P-3-2 (P < 0·05). There was a reduction in the IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in the peptide-treated mice groups. Total cell count and eosinophil count in BALF of the peptide-treated groups was also reduced compared to the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated group. Lung histology showed a significant reduction in cellular infiltrate in mice treated with P-2-2 and P-3-2 compared to PBS. In conclusion, peptides P-2-2 and P-3-2 lowered inflammatory responses and induced a Th1 response in mice.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142552","annotations":[{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.840078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.490794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.473598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.322685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"}]}
