{"id":61355,"title":"Hypereosinophilic syndrome.","abstract":"To summarize the identified molecular and cellular mechanisms relevant to clinicians evaluating patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).Review of relevant peer-reviewed literature.Studies on the pathogenesis of HES in relation to consensus definitions, disease classification, mechanisms of disease, and diagnosis and treatment are included.Changes to the definition of HES have been proposed based on recent studies identifying specific cellular and molecular disease phenotypes. Identification of specific mechanisms of disease may have clinical and therapeutic significance. Despite recent advances, in most cases the molecular pathogenesis of HES remains unknown.Identification of specific HES disease mechanisms empowers the practicing clinician to offer specific mechanism-based treatment options to patients with HES in their clinical practice.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726650","annotations":[{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.710066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.359708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hypereosinophilic syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereosinophilic_syndrome"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"}]}
