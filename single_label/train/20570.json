{"id":20570,"title":"Correlation between the response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and the tuberculin skin test in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Colombia.","abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis patients under treatment with anti-TNF-? are at a high risk of developing active tuberculosis, and therefore, screening for latent tuberculosis infection is recommended before anti-TNF-? therapy.To compare the tuberculin test and IFN? production induced by culture filtrate proteins(CFPs) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CFP-10 antigens in rheumatoid arthritis patients.An analytic transversal study was conducted in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated at Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundaci√≥n between January and December 2007. IFN? production in response to CFPs and CFP-10 was measured in the supernatants of whole blood cultures and evaluated for correlations with tuberculin reactivity. The degree of concordance between both tests was also established.Forty-five patients were included, of which 14 (31.1%) had a tuberculin reaction of ?10 mm of induration, 9 (20%) produced IFN? in response to CFP-10, and 7 were positive for both tests. The correlation between tests was r=0.53 (IC 95%:0.28-0.72), and the global concordance between tests was80%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.48 (IC95%:0.20-0.76).Only two tuberculin (-)/CFP-10+ \"anergic\" patients were observed. By contrast, six tuberculin +/CFP-10(-) \"tuberculin false-positive\" patients were observed. These data suggest that the tuberculin test is not an appropriate tool for determining the need for tuberculosis prophylaxis.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652132","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.812533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.634157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.354902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.161252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Clonal anergy","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_anergy"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Filter (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Transversal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal"},{"name":"Universitario de Deportes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitario_de_Deportes"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"}]}
