{"id":44139,"title":"Evaluation of the effectiveness of color intensity analysis using a second-generation autofluorescence imaging system for diminutive colorectal polyp differentiation.","abstract":"We previously reported the effectiveness of color tone intensity analysis using autofluorescence imaging (AFI) for distinguishing between colorectal neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Moreover, a second-generation AFI system has become commercially available in Japan. In the present study, we assessed the effectiveness of color tone intensity analysis using a second-generation AFI system for evaluating diminutive colorectal lesions.We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 35 consecutive patients with 101 diminutive colorectal lesions that were examined using a second-generation AFI system and resected at the Jikei University Hospital. We estimated the mean green-to-red (G/R) ratio - obtained by dividing the green color tone intensity by the red color tone intensity - of the lesions and compared the values of the neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. We also assessed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AFI system for neoplastic lesion identification.The mean G/R ratios of the non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions were 1.06 and 0.87, respectively; the mean G/R ratio significantly differed between the neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Using the second-generation AFI system, neoplastic lesions were identified with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 94.2%, 91.8%, 92.5%, and 93.8%, respectively.Color intensity analysis of diminutive colorectal polyps using the second generation AFI system could effectively distinguish between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750152","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.830419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.693318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.286665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.16588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.048965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"AFI (band)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_(band)"},{"name":"Autofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofluorescence"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Tone (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Diminutive","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"}]}
