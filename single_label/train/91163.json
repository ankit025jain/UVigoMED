{"id":91163,"title":"Falls among older general practice patients: a 2-year nationwide surveillance study.","abstract":"Falling among older persons is a multifactorial health condition needing multifactorial care. Several targeted preventive interventions and their coordination are considered to be general practitioner (GP)-specific tasks.To estimate the incidence of falls among older non-institutionalized general practice patients in Belgium (2009-10) and to describe the main characteristics of falls, fallers and fall risks; factors associated with multiple fall risks and the co-occurrence of fall risks; patient status 3 months later and care delivery.A 2-year nationwide cross-sectional study based on data collected by the Belgian network of Sentinel General Practices on all non-institutionalized persons aged ?65 years consulting their GP for new fall-related injuries.Baseline data were collected on 1503 persons and valid follow-up data were available on 715 persons (79%). The yearly incidence of older persons with fall-related injuries was estimated at 2.5% of the older general practice population; 39% of patients had also received hospital care, physician-specialist or nursing home care. A multifactorial risk profile was observed in 59% and associated with increasing age, recurrent falling, falling at home and during lower level activity. The clustering of frailty-specific fall risks was higher than expected by chance. At follow-up, 46% of at-risk patients had received physical therapy, 47% were using assistive devices, and medication had been reviewed in 28% of patients taking psychopharmacy and 17% of patients with polypharmacy.Our study shows a high burden of care for fall-related injuries in older general practice patients and provides baseline data for its future monitoring.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532609","annotations":[{"name":"Polypharmacy","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypharmacy"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.828943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.811497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.446332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"1503","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1503"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Falling (accident)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_(accident)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Mobility aids","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_aids"}]}
