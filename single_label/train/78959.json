{"id":78959,"title":"Association of C722T polymorphism in XRCC3 gene with larynx cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Several case-control studies indicated that XRCC3 genetic polymorphism (C722T) was associated with larynx cancer. The present study aimed to further evaluate the relation between the XRCC3 gene C722T polymorphism and larynx cancer. We selected five case-control studies related to XRCC3 gene C722T polymorphism and larynx cancer by searching PubMed, EMBase, Chinese CNKI, and Wanfang database. RevMan 5.0 software was used to perform the analysis. We directly utilized Q test and I (2) test to test the heterogeneity between each study. We utilized the fixed effects model to merge the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval. There were 1,507 larynx cancer patients and 3,623 cancer-free control subjects included in the present study. By meta-analysis, we did not find any association of XRCC3 gene C722T polymorphism with larynx cancer [OR=1.54, 95 % CI (0.77-3.08); P=0.22]. The present study indicated that XRCC3 gene C722T polymorphism was not associated with larynx cancer.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523020","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.903216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.892542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.581855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.541431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.483582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.42551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.271313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Fixed effects model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model"},{"name":"623","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/623"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
