{"id":1485,"title":"Substance abuse prevention: the role of the school nurse across the continuum of care.","abstract":"As a health care provider, health educator, and school/family/community liaison, the school nurse is in a unique position to act as a change agent for youth substance abuse prevention. This article discusses the roles of the school nurse as they apply to the prevention of substance abuse among school-age children, across a continuum of care model first introduced by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1994. Through careful assessment, identification of substance abuse risk factors, and promoting the enhancement of protective factors of students, both in and out of the school setting, the school nurse can play a vital role in the prevention of substance abuse. Existing tools, including the IOM Mental Health Intervention Spectrum Model, can be easily adapted to nursing practice and may prove helpful in assisting school nurses in the evaluation and implementation of effective prevention interventions in the school setting.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417332","annotations":[{"name":"Health education","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Institute of Medicine","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.679206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"School","weight":0.621298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.302908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.126504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Nursing practice","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_practice"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"School nursing","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nursing"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"School nurse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nurse"},{"name":"Substance abuse prevention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse_prevention"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Affair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"},{"name":"International Organization for Migration","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration"}]}
