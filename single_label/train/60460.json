{"id":60460,"title":"Chromatographic fingerprint analysis and effects of the medicinal plant species Mitracarpus frigidus on adult Schistosoma mansoni worms.","abstract":"The aims of this work were to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo schistosomicidal properties of the methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus (MFM) and to determine its HPLC profile. For the in vitro experiment, four pairs of adult worms, obtained from infected mice, were exposed to different concentrations of MFM (100 to 400 ?g/mL) for 24 and 48 h and analyzed under an inverted microscope. For the in vivo experiment, mice were inoculated with cercariae and, 20 days after infection, MFM (100 and 300 mg/kg) was administered orally for the following 25 days. Mice were euthanized after 60 days. MFM showed in vitro schistosomicidal activity, exhibiting the opening of the gynaecophoral canal of some male schistosomes, the presence of contorted muscles, vesicles, and the darkening of the paired worms skin. In vivo experiments showed that MFM treatments significantly reduced total worm count, as praziquantel, showing a decrease in liver and spleen weight. Also, a significant reduction in granuloma density was observed. MFM treatment did not cause alterations in the liver function of either infected or noninfected mice. The HPLC chromatogram profile showed the presence of kaempferol-O-rutinoside, rutin, kaempferol, psychorubrin, and ursolic acid.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901000","annotations":[{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.886344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.730883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.68133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.509687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.358217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.348478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Kaempferol","weight":0.322038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaempferol"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.276367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Rutin","weight":0.275845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutin"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.12668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"Trematode lifecycle stages","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematode_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"}]}
