{"id":81975,"title":"Mucogingival therapy to treat implant fenestration in the esthetic zone: a case report after 2 year follow up.","abstract":"Soft tissue fenestration in implants is considered not only as a situation that could negatively influence the long-term stability of the implant, but also creates an esthetic problem when it occurs in the visible area of the mouth. This article describes the resolution of a case that presented a vestibular fenestration of an osseointegrated implant placed to substitute the upper right incisor, which does not respect the recommendations of ideal three-dimensional position in a young patient with a high smile line. The case was treated using two mucogingival surgical techniques to avoid a more invasive approach. A prosthetic immediate final abutment was inserted in the day of the second surgery. The fenestration was successfully covered and 2 years later it remains stable. In this article, the details about the treatment are described.
