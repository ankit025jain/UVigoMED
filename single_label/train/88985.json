{"id":88985,"title":"[Value of modified Allis technique in closed reduction of posteriorly dislocated hip with Pipkin I/II fracture].","abstract":"To explore the value of modified Allis technique in closed reduction of posteriorly dislocated hip.For the control group, 98 cases of dislocated hips with Pipkin I/II fracture were studied retrospectively and their success reduction rates analyzed. For the experimental group, 36 cases with similar injury were studied prospectively. And the modified Allis technique was used and the success reduction rates were analyzed.Among the control group, 32 cases were reduced with a success rate of 67.3%. The success rate was 69.4% for the experimental group. And 97.2% of those unresponsive to the Allis technique were all successfully reduced by the modified Allis technique.The modified Allis technique is efficacious for posteriorly dislocated hips with Pipkin I/II fracture.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767298","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.500577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.229042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.210525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.127125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Dislocation of hip","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation_of_hip"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"}]}
