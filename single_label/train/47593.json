{"id":47593,"title":"Long-term efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the treatment of biliary dyskinesia.","abstract":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for biliary dyskinesia; however, long-term outcomes remain unclear.A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with biliary dyskinesia and treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a single institution between 2001 and 2012 was conducted. Long-term outcome data were obtained by telephonic interview using a modified Likert scale.Sixty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, of which 34 patients (51%) had long-term follow-up data. Mean time of follow-up was 65 (range: 6 to 134) months. Long-term follow-up demonstrated symptom response in 88% (n = 30) of patients (responders), compared to no response in 12% (n = 4) of patients (nonresponders). Responders underwent a mean of 1.56 preoperative diagnostic procedures, compared to 2.5 for nonresponders (P = .01).This represents the longest mean time of follow-up study demonstrating the success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy to improve symptoms in patients with biliary dyskinesia.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581761","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.73473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.279314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0602563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Biliary dyskinesia","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_dyskinesia"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.0222665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Telephony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephony"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"}]}
