{"id":66238,"title":"Kidney transplant recipients treated with belatacept exhibit increased naïve and transitional B cells.","abstract":"Phase III clinical studies have shown that kidney transplant (KT) recipients treated with the costimulation blocker belatacept exhibited a better renal allograft function and lower donor-specific anti-HLA immunization when compared to recipients treated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). We analyzed B cell phenotype in KT recipients treated with belatacept and stable renal function (N = 13). Results were compared to those observed in stable patients treated with CNI (N = 12), or with chronic antibody-mediated rejection (N = 5). Both transcriptional profile and phenotypic characterization of peripheral B cells were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, respectively. In belatacept group, the frequency and absolute number of transitional B cells as defined by both phenotypes: CD19(+) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) and CD19(+) IgD(hi) CD38(hi) CD27(-) , as well as naïve B cells were significantly higher compared with CNI group. B cell activating factor (BAFF) and BAFF receptor mRNA levels were significantly lower in belatacept group than in CNI group. These results show for the first time that belatacept influences B cell compartment by favoring the occurrence of transitional B cells with potential regulatory properties, as described in operational tolerant patients. This role may explain the lower alloimmunization rate observed in belatacept-treated patients.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730563","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.782931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.756197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.397615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Co-stimulation","weight":0.138009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-stimulation"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Alloimmunity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloimmunity"},{"name":"CD38","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD38"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
