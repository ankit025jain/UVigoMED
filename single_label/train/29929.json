{"id":29929,"title":"Feasibility of ambulatory withdrawal management delivered in a NSW drug health service and correlates of completion.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess short-term ambulatory withdrawal management (AWM) outcomes at a drug health service (DHS) in Sydney, Australia, in the absence of specific funding.A clinic file audit review was conducted of patients who commenced AWM at the service during January 2009-June 2011. Successful completion was defined as daily attendance with ?1 missed day, or transfer onto opioid substitution treatment.Of 110 episodes, 69 (63%) were completed. Median patient age was 35 years (range 18-71 years), and most patients (68%) were male. Patients presented primarily for cannabis (33%) or alcohol (30%) withdrawal, followed by heroin (19%) or other opioids (6%), and benzodiazepines (12%). Completion rates varied from 86% for non-heroin opioids to 31% for benzodiazepines. Older age was associated with increased completion: 76% of those aged >35 years completed compared with 50% of those ?35 years of age. Only 46% of women who commenced withdrawal management completed compared with 71% of men. CONCLUSIONS Most people commencing AWM at the DHS completed the program, indicating AWM can be performed at public drug and alcohol clinics. Service improvements may help increase completion rates among women and patients withdrawing from benzodiazepines. What is known about the topic? WM is not a standalone treatment for substance dependence, but is commonly a first attempt at treatment. AWM is often more acceptable to patients, and cheaper, than in-patient services. What does this paper add? About two-thirds of patients entering an AWM program operating since 2001 continue to complete the program. What are the implications for practitioners? AWM can be carried out successfully through public drug and alcohol services, although clinic staff support is important.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589255","annotations":[{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.827783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.784746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.712133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.711904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.689704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.6799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sydney","weight":0.633469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"},{"name":"New South Wales","weight":0.585271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.533195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.356263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.237727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"United States Department of Homeland Security","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Working memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"}]}
