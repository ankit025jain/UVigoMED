{"id":83160,"title":"[Increasing gingivoplasty efficiency by means of free palatal grafts].","abstract":"The paper presents short and long-term results of surgical treatment of 80 patients with insufficient attached gingiva. The procedures included vestibuloplasty and gingival plasty with perfluorane and free gingival and subepithelial connective tissue grafts. Proposed surgical treatment method with perfluorane proved to reduce the local inflammatory reaction greatly thus decreasing perioperative morbidity and increasing the long term efficacy of treatment.
