In this reasearch we aim to study the effects and mechanism of exogenous human recombinant T?10 on the expression of VEGF-C on non-small cell lung cancer.After SPC, A549 and LK2 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL recombinant human T?10, the mRNA level of VEGF-C were detected by RT-PCR. The mean while the protein expression of VEGF-C, P-AKT and AKT were determined by Western blot assay.Exogenous recombinant human T?10 were significantly promote the expression levels of VEGF-C mRNA and protein while promoting the phosphorylation of AKT. Exogenous T?10 can promote the expression of VEGF-C mRNA and protein in lung cancer cell lines A549 and LK2 (P<0.05), and this effect can be inhibited by use AKT inhibitor LY294002 (P<0.05).T?10 human recombinant proteins can promote the expression of VEGF-C by activating AKT phosphorylation in lung cancer cell lines.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854554","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.907678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.790995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.779114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.738735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.409261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Thymosins","weight":0.335391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymosins"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor C","weight":0.261135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_C"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Leukotriene","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
