{"id":56721,"title":"[Trends of refractive correction in the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Forces: examination after the Great East Japan earthquake].","abstract":"To investigate the trends in refractive correction in Japanese Ground Self-Defense Forces' (JGSDF) soldiers.A questionnaire was distributed to 519 soldiers of the Camp Funaoka in the northeastern region.Five hundred and sixteen subjects (99.4%) responded. In total, 246 soldiers (47.7%) wore spectacles or contact lenses. Among the contact lens wearers, 52 had experienced problems previously and 35 reported problems that occurred during military exercises. With regard to military exercises, 66.9% and 63.5% of the spectacle or disposable soft contact lens-users reported inconvenience. Among contact lens users, 33.1% reported that they changed to new sterilized contact lenses only occasionally and 61.9% did not change their contact lenses at all during exercises. During disaster-relief work, subjects worried 'very' (21.5%) or 'somewhat' (46.9%) about problems associated with their spectacles or contact lenses. Twenty-four had undergone refractive surgery (4.9%).About one-half of the JGSDF soldiers surveyed required refractive correction. Attention to convenient and safe refractive correction in the military is warranted.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640788","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.603174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.474108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.409115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.139604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Refractive surgery","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery"},{"name":"Japanese people","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.031033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Funaoka, Tottori","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funaoka,_Tottori"},{"name":"Japan Ground Self-Defense Force","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Ground_Self-Defense_Force"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Sterilization (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_(U.S._Census_Bureau)"},{"name":"Military exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trends (short story)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_(short_story)"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"List of earthquakes in Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_Japan"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Isan","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isan"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
