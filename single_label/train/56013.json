{"id":56013,"title":"Effects of sub-Tenon's anaesthesia on ocular hemodynamics.","abstract":"To research the effects of sub-Tenon's anaesthesia (STA) on ocular hemodynamics in patients with cataract using colour Doppler imaging (CDI).Prospective clinical study.Thirty-four eyes of 34 patients with age-related cataract.Peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistive index (RI) values of the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery, and central retinal vein were measured by CDI before and immediately after performing sub-Tenon block using 2 mL of 2% lidocaine with adrenaline (1:200 000).Both PSV and EDV values were significantly decreased after sub-Tenon injection in all the studied vessels of the patients. However, no important changes were observed in the RI values of the vessels.STA markedly reduced ocular blood flow. The reduction may be more acceptable compared with other retrobulbar block methods. Sub-Tenon block should be performed carefully to senile patients with cataract with vascular occlusive disorder.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767218","annotations":[{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.791282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.771067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.673821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.279241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Ophthalmic artery","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmic_artery"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"PSV Eindhoven","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven"},{"name":"Retrobulbar block","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrobulbar_block"},{"name":"Doppler imaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_imaging"},{"name":"Central retinal artery","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_artery"},{"name":"Rhode Island","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island"},{"name":"Plosive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Development_of_Indigenous_Peoples"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
