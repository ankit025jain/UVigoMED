{"id":29341,"title":"Screening for personality disorder in drug and alcohol dependence.","abstract":"Comorbidity of personality disorders in addiction is common, and there is a need for efficient detection methods. This study describes the use of two quick screening instruments: the self-reported versions of the Iowa Personality Disorder Screen (IPDS-SR) and the Standardised Assessment of Personality Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS-SR). The sample included 53 inpatients dependent on alcohol and/or drugs, with a 42% prevalence of any DSM-IV personality disorder. The Personality Assessment Schedule (PAS) was used as gold standard. Receiver-Operant-Characteristic (ROC) was used for analysis. The Area Under the Curve for the IPDS-SR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.93) and for the SAPAS-SR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.70-0.93). An IPDS-SR score of 5 or more correctly classified 77.4% of patients, with a sensitivity of 86.4% and a specificity of 71%. A SAPAS-SR score of 4 or more correctly classified 73.6% of patients, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 67.7%. Both instruments were quick, easy to administer, and acceptable to use by this population. They can be implemented in routine clinical practice in busy substance misuse departments. However further research into the implications of positive screenings is required.
