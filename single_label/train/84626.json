{"id":84626,"title":"[The difference of conformation of apoB-100 in lipoproteins of low and very low density. The modified lipoproteins and destructive inflammation in intima of arteries: a lecture].","abstract":"The formation of ligand occurs in phylogenetically earlier lipoproteins of very low density and later lipoproteins of very low density when apoB- 100 takes active conformation in association with essential polyenoic fatty acids, in form of ethers with alcohol cholesterol, palmitic and oleic triglycerides. In lipoproteins of low density apoB-100-domain-ligand is formed, in lipoproteins of very low density apoE/B-100-ligand is formed. The ligand lipoproteins absorb cells using apoE/B-100 and apoB-100 receptor endocytosis. In cases of excess of palmitic triglycerides. and lipoproteins of very low density of the same name in blood, damage of primary structure of post-heparin, hepatic lipoprotein lipase and co-enzymes apoC-II and apoC-II, phenotype E2/E2 blood accumulates pre-ligand lipoproteins rich in triglycerides. In case of pathology of apoB-100-receptor post-ligand lipoproteins of low density with low content of triglycerides are cumulated. All non-ligand lipoproteins in a physiological way denature neutrophils. The presence of pathology induces modification in case of action of other agents (glyco-toxins). The pre-lipoproteins form in the intima of arteries soft voluminous plaques and such destructive inflammatory process as athero-thrombosis. The post-lipoproteins form flat plaques and destructive inflammatory atheromatosis. The atherosclerosis can be labeled as disease ofconformation. The surplus of palmitic saturated fatty acids in food, phenotype E2/E2 and deletion of gene apoB-100-receptor are causes of intima lesion. The non-ligand lipoproteins form destructive process, dying foam cells and macrophages--inflammatory component. The atheromatosis is a result of realization of biological function of endoecology, support of \"purity\" of intercellular medium.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs
