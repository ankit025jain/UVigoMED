{"id":78060,"title":"[Effect of negative life events on tinnitus patients quality of life].","abstract":"To study the relationship between negative life events and quality of life of tinnitus patients, and explore the role of negative life events in psychological counseling and rehabilitation of tinnitus.Sixty-one cases of tinnitus patients and 61 normal controls were tested with tinnitus handicap inventory and life event scale, scores were compared and the associated analysis was made.Stimulating quantity of negative life events in the tinnitus group, compared with the control group was statistically different (Z = -2.56. P < 0.05). The incidence of negative life events in the tinnitus group compared with the control group was no statistically different (chi2 = 0.05, P > 0.05). The incidence of abnormal scores of negative life events compared with the control group was statistically different (chi2 = 16.68, P < 0.01). Positive correlation in tinnitus group was found between scores of negative life events and scores of tinnitus handicap inventory (r = 0.41, P < 0.01). The higher the score of negative life events, the lower the quality of life with tinnitus patients.Severity of negative life events and tinnitus is closely related, and negative life events can reduce the quality of tinnitus patients life. We should pay more attention to negative life events in psychological counseling with tinnitus patients. The intervention in negative life events can improve the quality of life. providing the targeted and individualized theory basis for tinnitus psychological counseling and rehabilitation.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800536","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.689749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.401684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.332234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Coordinated Universal Time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
