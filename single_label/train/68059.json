{"id":68059,"title":"Unexpected diagnosis of peripheral schwannoma on 18F-fluoroethylcholine PET/CT for localization of prostate cancer recurrence and biopsy under real-time PET/ultrasound fusion guidance.","abstract":"18F-Fluoroethylcholine (18F-FEC) PET/CT is well established for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence. However, its specificity is sometimes impaired by false-positive findings. In the present case, atypical cancer recurrence in the right distal lower leg was suspected on 18F-FEC PET/CT in a patient with a history of prostate cancer and an increased prostate-specific antigen level. Using a real-time PET/ultrasound fusion technique, the tumor was localized and a biopsy carried out, leading to a final diagnosis of peripheral schwannoma.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561678","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.791478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.57921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.482986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.408819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.229709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.214447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.209937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.0421175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.0388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
