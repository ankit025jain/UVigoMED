{"id":44154,"title":"Comparison of mortality following hospitalisation for ulcerative colitis in Scotland between 1998-2000 and 2007-2009.","abstract":"Scottish nationwide linkage data from 1998 to 2000 demonstrated high 3-year mortality in patients hospitalised with ulcerative colitis (UC).To compare 3-year mortality, and factors related to mortality, in Scottish patients hospitalised with UC between 1998-2000 and 2007-2009.The Scottish Morbidity Records and linked datasets were used to assess 3-year mortality, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and multivariate analyses of factors associated with 3-year mortality. The 3-year mortality was determined after four admission types: surgery-elective or emergency; medical-elective or emergency. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASR) were used to compare mortality rates between periods.Ulcerative colitis admissions increased from 10.6 in Period 1 to 11.6 per 100 000 population per year in Period 2 (P = 0.046). Crude and adjusted 3-year mortality fell between time periods (crude 12.2% to 8.3%; adjusted OR 0.59, CI 0.42-0.81, P = 0.04). Adjusted 3-year mortality following emergency medical admission (OR 0.58, CI 0.39-0.87, P = 0.003) and in patients >65 years (38.8% to 28.7%, P = 0.02) was lower in Period 2. The SMR in period 1 was 3.04 and 2.96 in Period 2. Directly age-standardised mortality decreased from 373 (CI 309-437) to 264 (CI 212-316) per 10 000 person-years. On multivariate analysis, increasing age (50-64 years OR 7.11 (CI 2.77-18.27, P < 0.05); 65-74 years OR 14.70 (CI 5.65-38.25 P < 0.05); >75 years OR 46.42 (CI 18.29-117.78, P < 0.001) and co-morbidity (OR 3.02, CI 1.72-5.28, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with 3-year mortality in Period 2.Comparisons of crude and adjusted mortality rates suggest significant improvement in outcome over the last decade - however, mortality remains high, and older age and co-morbidity are important predictors of outcome.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749792","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.633844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.615428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.52031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Standardized mortality ratio","weight":0.453327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_mortality_ratio"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.420541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.38724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Scotland","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.146731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.121401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Oregon Route 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_7"},{"name":"Oregon Route 46","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_46"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Geologic time scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Petroleum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Period (periodic table)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(periodic_table)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Period 1 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_1_element"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
