{"id":13614,"title":"Molecular cloning of the goose ACSL3 and ACSL5 coding domain sequences and their expression characteristics during goose fatty liver development.","abstract":"It has been demonstrated that ACSL3 and ACSL5 play important roles in fat metabolism. To investigate the primary functions of ACSL3 and ACSL5 and to evaluate their expression levels during goose fatty liver development, we cloned the ACSL3 and ACSL5 coding domain sequences (CDSs) of geese using RT-PCR and analyzed their expression characteristics under different conditions using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the goose ACSL3 (JX511975) and ACSL5 (JX511976) sequences have high similarities with the chicken sequences both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Both ACSL3 and ACSL5 have high expression levels in goose liver. The expression levels of ACSL3 and ACSL5 in goose liver and hepatocytes can be changed by overfeeding geese and by treatment with unsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Together, these results indicate that ACSL3 and ACSL5 play important roles during fatty liver development. The different expression characteristics of goose ACSL3 and ACSL5 suggest that these two genes may be responsible for specific functions.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469710","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Molecular cloning","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloning"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.724672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.586115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.574046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.480933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.396535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.362855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.327191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.284968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Goose","weight":0.240191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acids in wine","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acids_in_wine"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
