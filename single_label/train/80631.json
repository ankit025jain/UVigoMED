{"id":80631,"title":"Response to the critique by Hahn and others entitled \"Conservation and malaria in the Brazilian Amazon\".","abstract":"Hahn and others have recently criticized our study, \"Conservation efforts may increase malaria burden in the Brazilian Amazon,\" suggesting that results were flawed because of methodological limitations. Here, we briefly comment on some of their claims, showing that (1) several of their criticisms are misleading and others are incorrect, (2) they heavily criticize methods that they themselves have previously used, and (3) they selectively highlight some findings while ignoring others. We end this rebuttal by suggesting a way forward in this debate.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591438","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0304399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Rebuttal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuttal"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Critique","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Amazon Rainforest","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest"},{"name":"Otto Hahn","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hahn"},{"name":"Amazon Basin","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin"}]}
