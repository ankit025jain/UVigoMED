{"id":43786,"title":"Bile duct adenoma: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Bile duct adenoma (BDA) is a comparatively rare disease clinically, therefore, there are relatively few reported cases about it both in China and abroad.Herein, we present a 51-year-old man, diagnosed preoperatively with enhanced-contrast abdominal computed tomography, as having a nodule in the left hepatic. The patient underwent a liver tumor resection, and the histological examination revealed bile duct adenoma (BDA).BDA is an extremely rare benign tumor, which is difficult to distinguish BDA from hepatocellular carcinoma definitely preoperatively, surgical resection is needed as a way of treatment.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767257","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"China","weight":0.555396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.337968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.293635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
