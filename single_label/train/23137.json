{"id":23137,"title":"An exploration of health, family and economic experiences of leprosy patients, Iran.","abstract":"This study aims to explore the life experiences of Iranian leprosy patients in health, family and economic dimensions. Mycobacterium leprae is responsible for leprosy, a type of chronic inflammatory disease that existed from ancient times, still hearing the name of leprosy creates an awful imagination of cutting the organ, blindness and isolation and it has still remained as a serious social problem. The patients are confronted with particular problems physically and mentally. The phenomenological tradition was used to gain knowledge of the leprosy patients lived experiences. Data analysis method was based on Colaizzi's approach. This is a qualitative research using purposeful sampling, interviewing the leprosy patients referring to a contagious diseases department of the Health Network of Nourabad Lorestan City. Data were collected by interviews those were analyzed in Colaizzi's Methods to extract the conceptual codes. Some concepts obtained from the analysis of data in the study such as physical, psychological, social, family, economic experiences, cultural beliefs of society, the context for tendency toward defect and disability and social stigma. These findings suggest that health care professionals should pay attention not only to leprosy patients to reduce their physical and psychological but also to the community and public culture to reduce the leprosy patients suffering from social stigma. The results of the present study can help us in a better understanding of all aspects of patients' lived experiences.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
