{"id":89314,"title":"Optimizing functional and aesthetic outcomes of upper limb soft tissue reconstruction.","abstract":"This article highlights reconstructive principles in flap selection, use, and insetting to optimize functional and aesthetic outcomes after upper extremity reconstruction. The concept of respecting the aesthetic units of the hand during reconstruction is discussed. A current literature review of the aesthetic outcomes using various flaps, such as fasciocutaneous, fascia only, and muscle flaps, is provided. An approach based on aesthetic unit principles to upper extremity reconstruction is also highlighted to help optimize outcomes.
