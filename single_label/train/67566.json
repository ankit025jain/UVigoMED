{"id":67566,"title":"[Alpha emitter radium-223 dichloride: new therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases].","abstract":"Radium-223 dichloride (Ra-223) is an alpha emitter with low toxicity for the treatment of patients with castrations-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and symptomatic bone metastases showing a 30% reduction in the risk of death, as compared to placebo. Because of the favorable physical and chemical characteristics, Ra-223 can be handled easily in daily practice based on interdisciplinary co-operation between urology and nuclear medicine. Ra-223 has been approved under the product name XofigoÂ® by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604017","annotations":[{"name":"European Medicines Agency","weight":0.887757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Nuclear medicine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Radium","weight":0.770809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.551755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.498783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.454921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0960416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Bone tumor","weight":0.0924045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor"},{"name":"Chemical classification","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_classification"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
