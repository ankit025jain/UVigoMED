{"id":46568,"title":"Glypican-3-targeted 89Zr PET imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a devastating malignancy in which imperfect imaging plays a primary role in diagnosis. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is an HCC-specific cell surface proteoglycan overexpressed in most HCCs. This paper presents the use of (89)Zr-conjugated monoclonal antibody against GPC3 ((89)Zr-?GPC3) for intrahepatic tumor localization using PET.Polymerase chain reaction confirmed relative GPC3 expression in cell lines. In vitro binding, in vivo biodistribution, and small-animal PET studies were performed on GPC3-expressing HepG2 and non-GPC3-expressing HLF and RH7777 cells and orthotopic xenografts.(89)Zr-?GPC3 demonstrated antibody-dependent, antigen-specific tumor binding. HepG2 liver tumors exhibited high peak uptake (836.6 ± 86.6 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g) compared with background liver (27.5 ± 1.6 %ID/g). Tumor-to-liver contrast ratio was high and peaked at 32.5. The smallest HepG2 tumor (<1 mm) showed lower peak uptake (42.5 ± 6.4 %ID/g) and tumor-to-liver contrast (1.57) but was still clearly visible on PET. Day 7 tissue activity was still substantial in HepG2 tumors (466.4 ± 87.6 %ID/g) compared with control RH7777 tumors (3.9 ± 1.3 %ID/g, P < 0.01), indicating antigen specificity by (89)Zr-?GPC3. HepG2 tumor treated with unlabeled ?GPC3 or heat-denatured (89)Zr-?GPC3 demonstrated tumor activity (2.1 %ID/g) comparable to that of control xenografts, confirming antibody dependency.This study demonstrated the feasibility of using (89)Zr-?GPC3 to image HCC in the liver, as well as the qualitative determination of GPC3 expression via small-animal PET. The ability to clarify the identity of small liver lesions with an HCC-specific PET probe would provide clinicians with vital information that could significantly alter patient management, warranting further investigation for clinical translation.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System
