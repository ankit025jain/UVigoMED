{"id":54362,"title":"Prognosis of hepatoid yolk sac tumor in women: what's up, Doc?","abstract":"Ovarian yolk sac tumors are highly malignant germ cell tumors that commonly occur in young women. The hepatoid yolk sac tumor is a variant form of yolk sac tumor in which there has been extensive tumor differentiation to early liver tissue. Hepatoid differentiation is traditionally considered to signify a poor prognosis. This review focuses on diagnostic criteria and establishes the optimal treatment for patients with hepatoid yolk sac tumor. Immunohistochemical stains are useful for distinguishing hepatoid yolk sac tumor from the other hepatoid-appearing tumors. With a multidisciplinary treatment approach using platinum-based regimens, the outcome is similar to those of any yolk sac tumor.
