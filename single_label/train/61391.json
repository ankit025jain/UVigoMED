{"id":61391,"title":"[Pathologic diagnosis of mature B-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"Procedure of pathologic diagnosis of mature B-cell lymphoma (BCL) was explained. A definition of mature B-cell is given to have surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and it is easily detected by flow cytometry(FCM), but not by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Mature BCLs are subdivided into low grade BCL showing diffuse proliferation of CD2+ B-cells with low MIB-1 index or nodular proliferation of B-cells and high grade BCL showing diffuse proliferation of B-cells with high MIB-1 index. To make a proper diagnosis for low and high grade BCL, respectively, secondary IHC with CD5, CD10, BCL-2, BCL-6, MUM-1 and cyclin D1 is needed. Detecting clonality of light chain of sIg, FCM is useful for mature BCL.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724400","annotations":[{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.798053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.795104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.682546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.383934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"CD5 (protein)","weight":0.333248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD5_(protein)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.244936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Neprilysin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neprilysin"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bachelor of Civil Law","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law"},{"name":"BCL6","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCL6"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Society of American Magicians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_American_Magicians"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"CD2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD2"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"List of The King of Fighters characters","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_King_of_Fighters_characters"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
