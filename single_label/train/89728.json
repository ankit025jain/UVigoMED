{"id":89728,"title":"Causes of death following spinal cord injury during inpatient rehabilitation and the first five years after discharge. A Dutch cohort study.","abstract":"Prospective multicentre cohort study.To determine mortality, causes and determinants of death of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) within five years after first inpatient rehabilitation.The Netherlands.Patients were included on admission to first clinical rehabilitation after traumatic or nontraumatic SCI.age between 18 and 65, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale A-D and expected long-term wheelchair dependency. Information about survival, cause of death, relevant comorbidity and psychosocial circumstances was obtained from the rehabilitation physician or general practitioner. Determinants of death were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. Deceased persons and survivors were compared using ?(2)-test and t-test. Cox regression analysis was performed to describe independent predictors of death. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival curves for independent predictors. Excess mortality was described by a standardized mortality ratio (SMR).Mean duration of follow up was 6.2 years. A total of 27 persons (12.2%) died during this period (SMR 5.3). Main causes of death were cardiovascular disease (37.0%), pulmonary disease (29.6%) and neoplasm (14.8%). Older age at injury, nontraumatic SCI, family history of cardiovascular disease, less social support and a history of other medical conditions on admission were related to death. Older age at injury, nontraumatic SCI and a history of other medical conditions were independent predictors of death.Twelve per cent of persons with SCI who had survived the acute hospital phase died during follow up (SMR 5.3). The main causes of death were cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Wounds and
