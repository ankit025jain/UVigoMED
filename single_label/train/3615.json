{"id":3615,"title":"[Extracapsular arthroscopic excision of popliteal cysts through anterior combined with posterior approach].","abstract":"To study the clinical effect of arthroscopic excision of popliteal cysts through a combined anterior and posterior approach.From January 2010 to December 2012,20 patients with popliteal cysts were treated with arthroscopic excision. There were 14 males and 6 females, with an average age of 49.5 years old, ranging from 45 to 65 years old. The lump has been found for 4 to 18 months,with a mean time of 12 months. Their mean sagittal diameter was 4.5 cm (ranged from 3 to 7 cm). There were 12 popliteal cysts in the left and 8 popliteal cysts in the right. The main clinical manifestation included lump at popliteal fossa, swelling and pain at knee joint and some extent of dysfunction. All diagnoses were determined according to MRI, which clearly showed the communication of cyst and articular cavity. The cyst was removed under arthroscopy, through the posterior approach and then the intra-articular lesion was treated via the anterior approach. According to Rauschning and Lindgren classification, 2 patients were grade I, 6 patients were grade II, and 12 patients were grade III. The guidelines of Rauschning and Lindgren were used to evaluate the clinical effects.No complications such as the injury of blood vessel and nerve, or incision infection occurred in all patients. All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 8 to 24 months, with a mean time of 16 months. According to the criteria of Rauschning and Lindgren, there were 14 cases of grade 0, and 6 cases of grade I after operation, which was improved obviously compared with that pre-operation. No cyst reoccurred and the knee joint pain was relieved.Treatment of popliteal cysts with arthroscopic excision through a combined anterior and posterior approach is effective to remove the cyst sac and treat intra-articular diseases simultaneously, resulting in the decrease recurrence rate of cyst.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464585","annotations":[{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.529723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.459754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.44327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.440722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.32514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Popliteal fossa","weight":0.286018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_fossa"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"}]}
