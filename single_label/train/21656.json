{"id":21656,"title":"Incidence, pathogens and resistance patterns of nosocomial infections at a rural hospital in Gabon.","abstract":"Nosocomial infections pose substantial risk to patients receiving care in hospitals. In Africa, this problem is aggravated by inadequate infection control due to poor hygiene, resource and structural constraints, deficient surveillance data and lack of awareness regarding nosocomial infections. We carried out this study to determine the incidence and spectrum of nosocomial infections, pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns in a tertiary regional hospital in Lambaréné, Gabon.This prospective case study was carried out over a period of six months at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Lambaréné, Gabon. All patients admitted to the departments of surgery, gynecology/obstetrics and internal medicine were screened daily for signs and symptoms of hospital-acquired infections.A total of 2925 patients were screened out of which 46 nosocomial infections (1.6%) were diagnosed. These comprised 20 (44%) surgical-site infections, 12 (26%) urinary-tract infections, 9 (20%) bacteraemias and 5 (11%) other infections. High rates of nosocomial infections were found after hysterectomies (12%) and Caesarean sections (6%). Most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Eight (40%) of 20 identified E. coli and Klebsiella spp. strains were ESBL-producing organisms.The cumulative incidence of nosocomial infections in this study was low; however, the high rates of surgical site infections and multi-resistant pathogens necessitate urgent comprehensive interventions of infection control.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592922","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.812318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.806656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.652751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.401498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.246541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.177753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.142424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Albert Schweitzer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer"},{"name":"Gabon","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
