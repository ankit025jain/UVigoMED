{"id":86369,"title":"Reliability and validity of Persian version of perceived stress scale (PSS-10) in adults with asthma.","abstract":"Asthma is a major public health problem in the world, and recent findings suggest that stress influences asthma and asthma morbidity. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is one of the most frequently used instruments to measure psychological stress. This study was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Persian versions of the PSS-10 in adults with asthma.In this descriptive cross-sectional study as a methodological research, 106 asthmatic patients referring to several clinics in Sanandaj (western Iran) were selected through convenience sampling. The PSS-10 and the 21-item Depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) were administrated to all patients. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate reliability of PSS-10, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and convergent validity were used to evaluate its validity.The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor structure of PSS-10 provided a good fit to data. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for negative factor, positive factor and total score (PSS-10) were 0.86, 0.83, and 0.90, respectively. The PSS-10 was positively correlated with the DASS-21 and its subscales, indicating an acceptable convergent validity. Female asthmatic patients scored higher on PSS-10 in comparison with male asthmatic patients.The Persian version of PSS-10 is a valid and reliable instrument to measure perceived stress in adults with asthma.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784866","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.719411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.674607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.653522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.57259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.526043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Persian language","weight":0.376084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language"},{"name":"Accidental sampling","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.22583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.222407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.165536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.165245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Confirmatory factor analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Measuring instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument"},{"name":"Convergent evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
