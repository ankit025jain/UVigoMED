{"id":92019,"title":"Sequential treatment with teriparatide and strontium ranelate in a postmenopausal woman with atypical femoral fractures after long-term bisphosphonate administration.","abstract":"Despite the existence of numerous case series, no evidenced-based medical management for atypical fractures associated with bisphosphonate (BP) treatment has been established.We report the outcome of teriparatide (TRP) administration followed by strontium ranelate (SR) in a woman with a complete and an incomplete contralateral atypical fracture of the femoral diaphysis (AFF) associated with BP treatment. The spontaneous complete AFF was managed with intramedullary nailing, discontinuation of BP and initiation TRP.Eleven months later, she suffered a contralateral incomplete AFF. At the completion of the TRP treatment, she had only slight discomfort in the femur with the incomplete AFF. BMD testing revealed increase of 7.61% at the lumbar spine (LS) and 0.8% at the hip. Following TRP, 1-year SR treatment resulted in further BMD increase of 9.2% at the LS and 1.4% in the hip, while she does not report any pain. Bone markers remain within the normal range.Our case indicates that sequential therapy with TRP and SR in cases of AFF might be a rational treatment option. However, there is a need for additional information concerning the effect of TRP and SR, given alone or sequentially, in these patients in order to incorporate these drugs into the management of AFF.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457408","annotations":[{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.910198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.764194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.700665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.354156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.347851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.268427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.221945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strontium ranelate","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_ranelate"},{"name":"Teriparatide","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0918626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Strontium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium"},{"name":"Before Present","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present"},{"name":"ASEAN Football Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN_Football_Federation"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
