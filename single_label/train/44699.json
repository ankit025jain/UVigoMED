{"id":44699,"title":"Association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The oncogenic potential of human papillomaviruses (HPV) is well known in the context of cervical carcinoma; however, their role in the development of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is less clear. We aimed to determine the extent of the association between HPV infection and OSCC. A comprehensive literature search found 132 studies addressing HPV and OSCC in human cases, and a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. There was evidence of an increased risk of OSCC in patients with HPV infection [odds ratio (OR) 2·69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·05-3·54]. The prevalence of HPV in OSCC was found to be 24·8%. There was an increased risk associated with HPV-16 infection (OR 2·35, 95% CI 1·73-3·19). Subgroup analyses showed geographical variance, with Asia (OR 2·94, 95% CI 2·16-4·00), and particularly China (OR 2·85, 95% CI 2·05-3·96) being high-risk areas. Our results confirm an increase in HPV infection in OSCC cases.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721187","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.820553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"China","weight":0.654222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.535622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.503707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.501598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.368951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.317672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.287909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0269276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"}]}
