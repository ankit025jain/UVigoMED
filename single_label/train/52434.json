{"id":52434,"title":"Small for gestational age babies are not related to changes in markers of adipose tissue dysfunction during reproductive age.","abstract":"Small for gestational age (SGA) birth has been associated with adipocyte dysfunction during later phases of life. Because SGA women are at a higher risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), adipocyte dysfunction detected in patients with PCOS may be associated with SGA birth.To determine whether SGA birth is related to altered serum markers of adipose tissue dysfunction during the third decade of life in Brazilian women. A secondary objective was to relate the presence of PCOS with serum markers of adipose tissue dysfunction.Prospective cohort observational study.A total of 384 women born at 37 to 42weeks of gestation from June 1, 1978 to May 31, 1979 in Ribeirão Preto, State of São Paulo, Brazil. After exclusion, 165 women participated in the study. Of these women, 43 were in the SGA group and 122 were in the adequate for gestational age group based on birth weight determined from cohort files.Body mass index (BMI), arterial systolic and diastolic pressures, abdominal circumference and serum concentrations of total testosterone, fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile, adiponectin, leptin and necrosis factor alpha tumor (TNF?).BMI was an independent predictor of lower adiponectin (adjusted coefficient=-0.02, p=0.01) and higher leptin (adjusted coefficient=0.06, p=0.01) concentrations. The serum insulin concentration was associated with higher leptin (adjusted coefficient=0.03, p=0.02) and TNF-? (adjusted coefficient=0.01, p=0.03) concentrations. Having PCOS or being born SGA did not predict any markers of adipocyte dysfunction.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602474","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.800454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.75772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Small for gestational age","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_for_gestational_age"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.323314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.30341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.243552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.242916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.236941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"}]}
