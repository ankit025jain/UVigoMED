{"id":12823,"title":"Induction of phosphorylated c-Jun in neonatal spinal motoneurons after axonal injury is coincident with both motoneuron death and regeneration.","abstract":"c-Jun activation has been implicated not only in neuronal degeneration, but also in survival and regeneration. Here, we investigated c-Jun activation in injured motoneurons by using a nerve crush model in neonatal rats. We identified two distinct subpopulations of motoneurons: about 60% underwent degeneration following injury whereas the remaining 40% survived and induced a regeneration response at 3 weeks post injury. However, all motoneurons examined expressed phosphorylated-c-Jun-immunoreactivity (p-c-Jun-IR) at the early stage of 3 days following injury. These results suggest that active c-Jun was induced in all neonatal motoneurons following nerve crush injury, regardless of whether they were destined to degenerate or undergo successful regeneration at a later stage. Our findings therefore support the hypothesis that active c-Jun is involved in both neuronal degeneration and regeneration.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506149","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.513715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.477973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.222074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Crush syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_syndrome"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
