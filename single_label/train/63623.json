{"id":63623,"title":"Diagnostic criteria for autoimmune neutropenia.","abstract":"Autoimmune neutropenia denotes that the number of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils is below 1.5Ã—10(9)/L. This encompasses a wide range of disorders from primary conditions to complications of systemic autoimmune diseases or hematological neoplasms. Antineutrophil autoantibodies are particularly difficult to detect, and their amount does not correlate with the degree of neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is the first-line therapy, but should be restricted to patients with total absence of neutrophils and/or severe infections.
