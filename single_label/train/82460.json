{"id":82460,"title":"[Maxillary ameloblastic fibroma: a case report].","abstract":"Ameloblastic fibroma (AF) is a benign tumor, it is a true mixed tumor composed of neoplastic epithelium and mesenchymal. This tumor is rare, and it almost arises in the mandible. A 22-years old female patient referred AF in the maxillary was present. The tumor was asymptomatic, except the right facial bulge. The radiograph showed a well-circumscribed neoplasm with several low density cysts involving the right maxillary and ethmoid. The lesion was enucleated and the material was sent for histopathologic examination. Microscopically, it was composed epithelium and mesenchymal with histopathological diagnosis of ameloblastic fibroma.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620673","annotations":[{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.771951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fibroma","weight":0.524076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroma"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.394198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ethmoid bone","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethmoid_bone"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Enucleation (microbiology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
