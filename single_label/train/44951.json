{"id":44951,"title":"Minimally invasive approach to chagasic megacolon: laparoscopic rectosigmoidectomy with posterior end-to-side low colorectal anastomosis.","abstract":"The effectiveness of anterior resection for the surgical treatment of Chagasic megacolon and the advantages of laparoscopy for performing colorectal surgery are well known. However, current experience with laparoscopic surgery for Chagasic megacolon is restricted. Moreover, associated long-term results remain poorly analyzed. The aims of the present study were to ascertain the immediate results of laparoscopic anterior resection for the surgical treatment of Chagasic megacolon, to identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, and to settle late results. A retrospective review of a prospective database was conducted. Between November 2000 and September 2012, 44 patients with Chagasic megacolon underwent laparoscopic anterior resection with posterior end-to-side low colorectal anastomosis. Fifteen (34.1%) patients were male. Mean age was 51.6 years (31 to 77 y). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 22.9 kg/m (16.9 to 36.7 kg/m). Thirty-four previous abdominal operations had been performed. Mean operative time was 265 minutes (105 to 500 min). Four surgeons operated on all cases. Surgeon's experience with the operation was not associated with surgical time (P=0.36: linear regression). Mean operative time between patients with and without previous abdominal surgery was similar (237.7 vs. 247.5 min: P=0.78). There was no association between BMI and the duration of the operation (P=0.22). Intraoperative complications occurred in 2 (4.5%) cases. Conversion was necessary in 3 (6.8%) cases. There was no association between conversion and previous abdominal surgery (P=0.56) or between conversion and surgeon's experience (P=0.43). However, a significant association (P=0.01) between BMI and conversion was observed. Postoperative complications occurred in 10 (22.7%) cases. Anastomotic-related complications occurred in 4 cases. Two of them required diversion ileostomy. Restoration of transanal evacuation was achieved in all cases. Mean duration of postoperative hospital stay was 9.8 days (4 to 45 d). Of 19 patients with known clinical late follow-up, only 1 (5.3%) reported use of enemas and 5 (26.3%) reported use of laxatives. Thirteen (68.4%) patients reported daily bowel movements. There was no association between postoperative complications and use of laxatives (P=0.57). It was concluded that laparoscopic anterior resection for Chagasic megacolon is safe. Obesity was a risk factor for conversion. Restoration of transanal evacuation after surgical treatment of infectious complications was achieved. Minimally invasive surgery for Chagasic megacolon is associated with satisfactory late intestinal function with no significant constipation relapse.
