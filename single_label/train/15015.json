{"id":15015,"title":"The Advanced Locking Plate System (ALPS): a retrospective evaluation in 71 small animal patients.","abstract":"To evaluate use of the Advanced Locking Plate System (ALPS) in dogs and cats and report outcome.Retrospective case series.Dogs (n?=?29) and cats (n?=?42).The medical records (April 2007-April 2010) of dogs and cats treated with ALPS were reviewed evaluated. Data retrieved included signalment, indication for surgery, complications, and outcome.ALPS was used for 54 fractures, 12 tarsal or carpal ligament injuries and in 6 cases, to prevent or treat fractures during total hip replacement. Complications needing revision surgery occurred in 4 cases (5.5%): fixation failure was identified in 3 (2 fracture-fixations, 1 pancarpal arthrodesis), and a fracture occurred through a screw hole. The most common complication after tarsal arthrodesis was suture dehiscence. All cases had healed by study end.ALPS offers a reliable alternative for fracture treatment and some other orthopedic conditions in small animals.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393096","annotations":[{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.741578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.617131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.299321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.272007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.228267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
