{"id":34872,"title":"[PCSK9 inhibitors: emerging treatment to lower cholesterol?].","abstract":"The achievement rate of recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets of < 1.8 mmol/l for secondary prevention in very high risk patients is difficult. Observational studies reported that loss of function mutation of the PCS9 was associated with LDL-C decrease level and reduction of cardiovascular events. Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 (REGN727 and AMG 145, PSCK9 inhibitors) have been tested in clinical studies of phase I and II and showed LDL-C level reduction of 60-70% compared to placebo. This approach appears safe and well-tolerated. The PCSK9 inhibitors are now tested in large phase III clinical studies to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this new promising approach.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701672","annotations":[{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.539311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.150717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PCSK9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSK9"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
