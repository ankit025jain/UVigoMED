{"id":37760,"title":"MELAS, an important consideration in the adult population presenting with unusual and recurrent stroke-like episodes.","abstract":"A 48-year-old man was admitted for workup of stroke-like symptoms and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. History and examination revealed that the patient had background diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and had suffered a temporal lobe infarct 3 years ago. The unusual presentation and physical findings, along with subsequent MRI findings led to a diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). MELAS is a mitochondrial disorder typified by the aforementioned symptoms, and is typically diagnosed in the first two decades of life.
