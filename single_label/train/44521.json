{"id":44521,"title":"Intracellular delivery of cytochrome c by galactosylated albumin to hepatocarcinoma cells.","abstract":"In some cancer cells, translocation of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria to the cytoplasma is inhibited. This inhibition prevents cells from undergoing apoptotic cell death and can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Increasing cytoplasmic concentration of Cyt c can induce apoptosis in cancer cells as a strategy of cancer therapy. Here we proposed a galactosylated albumin based carrier for intracellular delivery of Cyt c to hepatocarcinoma cells. Galactosylated albumin is recognized by highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR) on hepatocarcinoma cells and is further internalized into cells via receptor mediated endocytosis. Cyt c was chemically conjugated to galactosylated albumin with a reducible disulfide linker in order to release Cyt c from the carrier inside cells. We tested cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of Cyt c conjugates in ASGPR positive and negative hepatocarcinoma cells. The results showed galatosylated albumin significantly increased cellular uptake in both cell types resulting in cytotoxicity in a dose dependent manner through the induction of apoptosis. The lack of ASGPR specific uptake might be due to other carbohydrate-recognizing receptors expressed on tumor cells. In general, our work has shown that intracellular delivery of Cyt c to tumor cells can be an alternative therapeutic approach and galactosylated albumin can be a protein drug carrier for intracellular delivery.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731058","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.859999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.577197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.570183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.374681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.344055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Disulfide","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.163172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Inductive effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_effect"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
