{"id":40586,"title":"[Risk factors for parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis in neonates].","abstract":"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life saving and support therapy for critical newborn infants. Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is one of its common complications. This article focuses on the risk factors for PNAC in newborn infants in both non-nutrient and nutrient associated risk factors. The main risk factors include prematurity, small for gestational age, prolonged PN, diseases (especially sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis), delayed or less proportional enteral nutrition, non cyclic PN, amino acids/lipids composition and dosage, energy supply and trace elements contents.
