{"id":18049,"title":"Comparison of dermatoses seen in community health camps and a tertiary care centre in Kashmir.","abstract":"Various environmental, socio-economic and geographical factors influence the pattern of dermatoses in an area. Observations made at tertiary dermatology centres may not reflect the actual pattern of dermatoses at the community level.To evaluate the pattern of dermatoses at community level and compare it with that at a tertiary centre.Cases were registered through community visits in block Hazratbal in Kashmir valley, once a week over a calendar year. The pattern of dermatoses observed was compared with that seen at the tertiary centre over the same period.A total of 1065 community cases, with 1105 dermatoses, were compared with 4358 patients with 4466 dermatoses seen at the tertiary centre. Non-infectious dermatoses in each group were more common than infectious dermatoses (34.08% infectious dermatoses versus 65.97% non-infectious in community cases and 29.42% infectious dermatoses versus 70.58% non-infectious in hospital patients). Infectious cases were seen significantly more in the community (34.08%) than at the tertiary centre (29.42%). Among the infectious diseases, fungal infection was the most common and in the non-infectious group, pigmentary disorders were the most common, followed by acne and eczema.Infectious dermatoses were found statistically significantly more in community cases as compared to hospital patients while the opposite was the case with non-infectious dermatoses. The study emphasizes the need for providing frequent dermatology services to the community at the primary healthcare level so that the burden of dermatoses, especially infectious, may be reduced. Also, wider studies should be conducted in different regions in order to assess the actual magnitude of dermatological illnesses in the community.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823398","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.579314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.347891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.328122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.254457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.221751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.202124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Acne","weight":0.157647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Valley","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"Kashmir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
