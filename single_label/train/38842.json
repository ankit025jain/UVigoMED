{"id":38842,"title":"Peripheral autonomic nervous system involvement in Gaucher-related parkinsonism.","abstract":"The pathological process affects the peripheral autonomic nervous system in the vast majority of sporadic PD patients. Recent reports have shown that patients with a familial form of the disease caused by mutation of the gene encoding LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein also display autonomic abnormalities, especially cardiac sympathetic denervation. In the present report, we have studied the involvement of the peripheral autonomic system in a patient with Gaucher disease-associated parkinsonism. Using colonic biopsies and quantitative 123I-MIBG scintigraphy respectively, we show that both Lewy pathology and cardiac denervation were present in this case of Gaucher-associated Parkinsonism. We discuss the consequence of these findings on the pathophysiology of the disease.
