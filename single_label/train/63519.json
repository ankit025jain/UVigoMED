{"id":63519,"title":"Slow pull versus suction in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic solid masses.","abstract":"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic masses is an established procedure for obtaining a pathological specimen. However, application of suction during EUS-FNA is still controversial and the efficacy of the slow-pull technique was recently reported for new core biopsy needles.The purpose of this study was to compare the suction and slow-pull techniques using regular FNA needles.The diagnostic yield of the suction and slow-pull techniques was retrospectively studied for patients who underwent EUS-FNA for pancreatic solid lesions.A total of 367 passes (181 by suction and 186 by the slow-pull technique) were performed during 97 EUS-FNA procedures for 93 patients with pancreatic solid lesions. The slow-pull technique resulted in lower scores for cellularity (?2 for 37.5 % vs. 76.7 %) but scores for contamination with blood were lower (?2 for 25.0 % vs. 66.7 %) and sensitivity of diagnosis of malignancy was higher (90.0 % vs. 67.9 %) when a 25-gauge FNA needle was used. There were no significant differences between the two techniques when a 22-gauge needle was used. In multivariate analysis of 82 cases with malignancy, the slow-pull technique (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, P = 0.028), tumor size ?25 mm (OR 4.64, P < 0.001), and tumor location in the body or tail (OR 2.82, P < 0.001) were associated with greater sensitivity.The slow-pull technique was associated with less contamination with blood and can potentially increase the diagnostic yield compared with the suction technique in EUS-FNA of pancreatic solid masses, especially with a 25-gauge FNA needle.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429514","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.74127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.638817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.507387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.492511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"25 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Slow (song)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_(song)"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
