{"id":8626,"title":"Risk assessment for the design of a risk-based surveillance programme for fish farms in Switzerland (in accordance with Council Directive 2006/88/EC of the European Union).","abstract":"Swiss aquaculture farms were assessed according to their risk of acquiring or spreading viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN). Risk factors for the introduction and spread of VHS and IHN were defined and assessed using published data and expert opinions. Among the 357 aquaculture farms identified in Switzerland, 49.3% were categorised as high risk, 49.0% as medium risk and 1.7% as low risk. According to the new Directive 2006/88/EC for aquaculture of the European Union, the frequency of farm inspections must be derived from their risk levels. A sensitivity analysis showed that water supply and fish movements were highly influential on the output of the risk assessment regarding the introduction of VHS and IHN. Fish movements were also highly influential on the risk assessment output regarding the spread of these diseases.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761728","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.86913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.752993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.7441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Aquaculture","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.574226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.476564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.363658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.357947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.28029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.061283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Directive (European Union)","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"VHS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS"},{"name":"Fish farming","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
