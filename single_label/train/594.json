{"id":594,"title":"Characterization of recombinant flagellin B protein from Leptospira interrogans.","abstract":"Symptoms of the early phase leptospirosis often are non-specific and can be a major problem in making a diagnosis of febrile illnesses. Rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis is of extreme importance, because antibiotic treatment provides greatest benefit when administered in early stage of the disease. Recombinant flagellin B (FlaB) gene (flaB) of Leptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis strain Akiyami A was heterologously expressed and purified. The 35 kDa recombinant FlaB was 99% similar to the reference strain in GenBank. Rabbit polyclonal antirecombinant FlaB antibodies recognized using immunoblotting yeilded 35-36 kDa doublet from one saprophytic and eight pathogenic Leptospira serovars. Western blot assay showed that recombinant FlaB could distinguish leptospirosis from non-leptospirosis sera. This recombinant FlaB can be used in serodiagnosis of leptospirosis and identification of Leptospira spp.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417509","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.876779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Leptospirosis","weight":0.760569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"},{"name":"Leptospira","weight":0.749187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospira"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Saprotrophic nutrition","weight":0.633164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotrophic_nutrition"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.46009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.458217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Flagellin","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
