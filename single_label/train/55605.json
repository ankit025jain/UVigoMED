{"id":55605,"title":"Amblyopia.","abstract":"Amblyopia refers to unilateral or bilateral reduction in best corrected visual acuity, not directly attributed to structural abnormality of the eye or posterior visual pathways. Early detection of amblyopia is crucial to obtaining the best response to treatment. Amblyopia responds best to treatment in the first few years of life. In the past several years a series of studies undertaken by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) have been designed to evaluate traditional methods for treating amblyopia and provide evidence on which to base treatment decisions. This article summarizes and discusses the findings of the PEDIG studies to date.
