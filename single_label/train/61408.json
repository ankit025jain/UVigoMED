{"id":61408,"title":"[Iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: from diagnosis to therapy].","abstract":"Anaemia and iron deficiency are frequent co-morbidities in patients with chronic heart failure. Both are bound to worsen an already reduced exercise capacity in these patients. Recent data have demonstrated that iron deficiency alone, i.e. without concomitant anaemia, reduces quality of life, exercise capacity and likely also survival. Two clinical entities should be differentiated in this context: absolute and functional iron deficiency, the first being an absolute deficiency of iron, the second representing a disturbed mobilisation capacity. The FAIR-HF study has shown that intravenous iron administration can improve quality of life and exercise capacity in affected patients. A correct diagnosis can easily be arrived at using parameters such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Replenishing iron stores is most useful using the intravenous route, and administered doses need to be adjusted to individual needs.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722935","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.720698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.527397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.170536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Transferrin saturation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_saturation"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
