{"id":52253,"title":"Frequent translocations of 11q13.2 and 19p13.2 in ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Aberrations of chromosome arm 19p in ovarian cancer were first described decades ago and have been confirmed in recent publications, which have focused on chromosome 11 as a translocation partner. Recently, genetic analysis of the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 revealed a rearrangement described as der(19)t(11;19)(q13.2;p13.2), which lead to a fusion protein containing parts of HOOK2 and frame shifted ACTN3 that had unknown functionality. To evaluate the frequency of these breakpoints, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes flanking these genes for interphase analysis of ovarian cancer cells. We analyzed 49 primary cell cultures of ovarian cancers using FISH probes next to these breakpoints on chromosomes 11 and 19 defined in SKOV3. Co-localizations of the signals in interphase nuclei were considered to be positive fusions when the frequency was over the experimentally calculated cutoff of 24.3% (mean average value for normal ovary cells plus three times the standard deviation). Fusions between 11q13.2 and 19p13.2 were confirmed in 22 (45%) primary cell cultures of ovarian cancers. However, by PCR, the fusion originally described in SKOV3 was not detected in any of the primary cell cultures. Our results confirm other reports and show that these regions are very frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, they reveal a significant correlation (P = 0.023) of co-localized signals of 11q13.2 and 19p13.2 with low and intermediate grades in ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615723","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.793585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Interphase","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.748753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.702867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.699571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.65259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.517548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.417115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Chromosome 11 (human)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_11_(human)"},{"name":"Chromosome 19 (human)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_19_(human)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"}]}
