{"id":42756,"title":"White opaque substance visualized using magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging in colorectal epithelial neoplasms.","abstract":"The presence of a white opaque substance (WOS) on magnifying endoscopy (ME) with narrow-band imaging (NBI) has been reported for gastric epithelial neoplasms, but the presence of WOS in colorectal epithelial neoplasms has not been investigated.The purpose of this study was to determine whether WOS is present in colorectal epithelial neoplasms and to clarify its clinical significance.A total of 590 colorectal epithelial neoplasms from 368 consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Presence or absence of WOS in colorectal epithelial neoplasms was recorded based on the findings of ME with NBI.White opaque substance was present in 236 of the 590 (40 %) colorectal epithelial neoplasms. Compared with WOS-negative patients, WOS-positive patients showed significantly larger tumors (p < 0.0001) and significantly more tumors in the proximal colon (p = 0.0003). WOS was more frequently present in carcinomas (66.0 %) than in adenomas (31.8%; p < 0.0001). WOS was also more frequent in submucosal carcinomas (75.9%) than in intramucosal carcinomas (59.0%; p = 0.0380).This study confirmed the presence of WOS in colorectal epithelial neoplasms, and prevalence increased with the progression of cancer, from adenoma to carcinoma and from intramucosal carcinoma to submucosal carcinoma.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828918","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.646419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.552683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.250125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Narrowband","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"590","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/590"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Magnification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Web operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_operating_system"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Chronic fatigue syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome"}]}
