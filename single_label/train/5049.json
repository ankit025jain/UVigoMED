{"id":5049,"title":"Calluses flex their muscles to align bone fragments during fracture repair.","abstract":"Neonatal animals spontaneously reduce fractures, yet the mechanical forces influencing this process are poorly understood. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Rot etÂ al. (2014) show that muscle and the fracture callus actively position fractured neonatal bone fragments to restore their alignment, highlighting the multifaceted roles of mechanical cues in skeletal regeneration.
