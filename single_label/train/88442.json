{"id":88442,"title":"Imaging of traumatic injuries to the scrotum and penis.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to review scrotal and penile anatomy, the role of ultrasound in evaluating scrotal and penile trauma, and the vast spectrum of sonographic manifestations of scrotal and penile trauma.Scrotal and penile trauma is an uncommon type of trauma injury. However, knowledge of scrotal and penile anatomy and the appropriate imaging findings associated with acute traumatic injuries is important in establishing the correct diagnosis. Sonography is considered the first choice of imaging modalities in establishing a diagnosis and triaging patients into surgical and nonsurgical treatment.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848844","annotations":[{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.584948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Stimulus modality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_modality"}]}
