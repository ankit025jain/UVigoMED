{"id":85764,"title":"Ma Huang Tang ameliorates asthma though modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokines and inhibition of Th17 cells in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.","abstract":"Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra decoction, MHT) is a famous classical formula from Shang Han Lun by Zhang Zhongjing in the Han Dynasty. The anti-asthmatic effects of MHT and the possible mechanisms were tested.An asthma model was established by ovalbumin (OVA)-induction in mice. A total of forty-eight mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2 mg·kg(-1)) and MHT (5, 10, and 20 mg·kg(-1)). Airway resistance (Raw) was measured by the forced oscillation technique, histological studies were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Th1/Th2 and Th17 cytokines were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM).This study demonstrated that MHT inhibited OVA-induced increases in Raw and eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17 levels were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, increased IFN-? level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrated that MHT substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated that MHT substantially inhibited Th17 cells.These findings suggest that MHT may effectively ameliorate the progression of asthma, and could be further investigated for potential use as a therapy for patients with allergic asthma.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856759","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.828879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.824566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.643209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.385617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"H&E stain","weight":0.358411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&E_stain"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.347679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.346139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Decoction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
