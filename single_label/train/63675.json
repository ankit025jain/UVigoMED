{"id":63675,"title":"Aberrant expression of CD13 identifies a subgroup of standard-risk adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia with inferior survival.","abstract":"The standard-risk (SR) subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults (aALL) is a heterogeneous category, with a 20% to 40% relapse rate and a wide range of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). There is a need to identify at the outset those patients with SR-aALL who are likely to have shorter RFS and OS, so they can be treated more aggressively.Flow cytometric data of 81 patients with SR-aALL treated with a standardized protocol were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-two patients (40%) relapsed; the median RFS and OS were 12.5 months (range, 1-136 months) and 30 months (range, 3-235 months), respectively. Twenty-six patients survived ? 48 months.Expression of myeloid antigen CD13, using the conventional ? 20% threshold and a lower ? 5% threshold, was seen in 17 (29%) of 59 and 29 (49%) of 59 patients, respectively, whereas dual expression of CD13 and CD33 was seen in 8 patients. CD13 positivity at ? 20% and ? 5% threshold was associated with a shorter RFS (P = .0158 and P < .0001, respectively) and OS (P = .0072 and P < .0001, respectively). Dual expression of CD13 (at ? 5% or ? 20% threshold) and CD33 was associated with inferior OS (P = .0038 and P = .0032, respectively) and RFS (P = .0705 and P = .2516, respectively). For ? 20% and ? 5% threshold of positivity, 16 of 42 and 28 of 42 who survived < 48 months were positive, compared with 1 of 17 and 1 of 17 who survived ? 48 months (P = .0133 and P < .0001, respectively).Aberrant expression of CD13 in ? 5% of blasts of patients with SR-aALL is an adverse prognostic factor, delineating a subgroup of patients with SR-aALL that should be considered for more aggressive treatment.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411984","annotations":[{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.696716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.439853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.3699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.33407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.238548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"CD33","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD33"},{"name":"Alanine aminopeptidase","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_aminopeptidase"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"1136","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1136"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Remote File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_File_System"},{"name":"Uncial 0133","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0133"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Aberrant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberrant"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
