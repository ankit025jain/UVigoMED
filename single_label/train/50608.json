{"id":50608,"title":"The role of AMH in anovulation associated with PCOS: a hypothesis.","abstract":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility due to anovulation. Despite its prevalence, the precise cause of the anovulation is yet to be clearly defined. There is an increased number of pre-antral and antral follicles in the polycystic ovary, many of which individually produce increased amounts of anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) compared with those in the normal ovary. In this article, it is hypothesized that the high AMH concentrations present in women with PCOS play an integral role in causing anovulation due to its inhibitory influence on the actions of follicle-stimulating hormone, which normally promotes follicular development from the small antral to the ovulatory stage.
