{"id":80621,"title":"Protective effect of Thunbergia laurifolia extract on hemolysis during Plasmodium berghei infection.","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of Thunbergia laurifolia leaf extract to protect hemolysis in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. Aqueous leaf extract of T. laurifolia was freshly prepared, and total polyphenol was then measured using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method. For in vivo test, ICR mice were given intraperitoneally with this extract (1,000 mg/kg) once a day for four consecutive days and subsequently inoculated with 1?Ã—?10(6) parasitized erythrocytes of P. berghei ANKA by intraperitoneal injection for 8 days. The results showed that hemolysis was inhibited as indicated by %hematocrit (%Hct) which was normal in infected mice treated with T. laurifolia extract. Untreated and pyrimethamine-treated controls showed decreasing %Hct. Moreover, no any toxic signs were observed in normal mice treated with this extract. We conclude that T. laurifolia leaf extract clearly protects hemolysis during P. berghei infection in mice.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595643","annotations":[{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.821901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Polyphenol","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.719546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.575724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.324244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.28825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.169146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Plasmodium berghei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_berghei"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"1106","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1106"},{"name":"Intelligent character recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_character_recognition"},{"name":"Thunbergia","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunbergia"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
