{"id":83345,"title":"Blow fly maggots (Diptera: Calliphoridae)from a human corpse in a vehicle.","abstract":"Correct species identification and development data of insects associated with a cadaver can help estimate the time of colonization which could be used to infer a minimal post-mortem interval (minPMI) for forensic investigations. Human remains are found in a variety of locations ranging from open fields to inside automobiles. We report the investigation of blow fly larvae collected from a decomposing body located in the trunk of a car. There were two blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) species: Achoetandrus rufifacies (Macquart) and Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius). Blow flies can enter the vehicle and colonize human remains. Based on age estimations of third stage larvae of A. rufifacies, the minPMI was estimated to be 4-5 days, which was within the range of 3-5 days estimated by other forensically relevant information.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417501","annotations":[{"name":"Justin Pierre Marie Macquart","weight":0.894529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Pierre_Marie_Macquart"},{"name":"Calliphoridae","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliphoridae"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Post-mortem interval","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-mortem_interval"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Maggot","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggot"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.750102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Johan Christian Fabricius","weight":0.533837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Christian_Fabricius"},{"name":"Body","weight":0.279976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Chrysomya megacephala","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysomya_megacephala"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Chrysomya","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysomya"}]}
