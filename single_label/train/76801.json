{"id":76801,"title":"Metabolic syndrome and cortisol/DHEAS ratio in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.","abstract":"The cortisol/DHEAS ratio has been found to predict different health outcomes. We examined the association between cortisol/DHEAS ratio and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The only subcomponent of MetS positively associated with the cortisol/DHEAS ratio was diastolic blood pressure. Possible reasons for this finding, as well as study limitations, are discussed.
