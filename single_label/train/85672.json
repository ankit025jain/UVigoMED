{"id":85672,"title":"Patient-centred management in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: similar themes in three communication models.","abstract":"The progressive and highly variable course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can present patients and their families with various challenges at different points of the disease. Structured communication between the healthcare professional and the patient is vital to ensure the best possible support and treatment for the patient. While research in this area has been limited, an increasing number of studies are emerging that support the role of communication in patients with debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Communication models used in other conditions that share many challenges with IPF, such as cancer, provide important insights for developing specifically designed patient support and communications models in IPF. Three communication models will be described: 1) the patient-centred care model (for oncology); 2) the three pillars of care model (for IPF); and 3) the Brompton model of care (for interstitial lung disease). Themes common to all three models include comprehensive patient education, encouraged patient participation and an accessible healthcare system, all supported by a collaborative provider-patient relationship. The development of effective communication skills is an on-going process and it is recommended to examine communication models used in other chronic diseases.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881078","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.46748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.393648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.363254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Interstitial lung disease","weight":0.183889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health care industry","weight":0.0582433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_industry"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Patient education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_education"}]}
