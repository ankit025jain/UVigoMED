{"id":46088,"title":"Validation of a dropout assessment model of candidates with/without hepatocellular carcinoma on a common liver transplant waiting list.","abstract":"The model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is often used for liver graft allocation, and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receive exception points (22 in the US). A better model is desirable for patients with HCC as they tend to have a privileged access to transplantation, without taking HCC characteristics into account. A new simpler model designed from a training set of US patients (n = 49 026) was tested on two validation sets (US and UK patient cohorts with, respectively, n = 20 475 and n = 1781). The risk of dropout was between 3.2 and 7.8% at 3 months in patients with HCC, and was captured into a score, including HCC size, HCC number, AFP, and MELD (-37.8 +1.9*MELD+5.9 if HCC Nb ? 2 + 5.9 if AFP > 400 + 21.2 if HCC size > 1 cm). This new model could be validated on external US and UK liver candidate cohorts. It provides a dynamic and more accurate assessment of dropout than the use of exception MELD (C-indices of 66.2-73.7% vs. 52.7-56.6%). In addition, the model shows a similar distribution as MELD for patients with non-HCC, and both scores could be used in parallel for the management of waiting-list patients with and without HCC.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649861","annotations":[{"name":"Liver","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.661334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.578253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.515674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.270223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"756","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/756"},{"name":"1781","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1781"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Training set","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set"},{"name":"Agence France-Presse","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social status","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"},{"name":"Niobium","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium"}]}
