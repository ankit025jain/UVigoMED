{"id":53644,"title":"Cabergoline treatment in acromegaly: cons.","abstract":"Many options are available for the treatment of acromegaly, including surgery, radiotherapy, and medical treatment. Cabergoline (CAB), a dopamine agonist with high affinity for dopamine receptor type 2, has been used both in monotherapy and in conjunction with somatostatin analogs (SSAs). Although it is administered orally and has a relatively lower-cost in comparison with SSAs, few studies have demonstrated its usefulness, there is a lack of randomized-controlled trials and other drugs (SSAs and pegvisomant) with more data in the literature are available; these issues are the main drawbacks of adopting CAB for the treatment of acromegaly.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504766","annotations":[{"name":"Acromegaly","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor"},{"name":"Dopamine agonist","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_agonist"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cabergoline","weight":0.728682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabergoline"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.399321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pegvisomant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegvisomant"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"}]}
