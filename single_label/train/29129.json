{"id":29129,"title":"The high cost of bath salts: a study of the health care burden of illicit synthetic drug use in Duluth, Minnesota.","abstract":"The Minnesota Department of Health conducted an exploratory epidemiologic investigation into the health care burden of illicit synthetic drug (ISD) use in Duluth, Minnesota. Staff reviewed medical records of 78 patients with suspected ISD use who were treated in emergency departments at two Duluth-area hospitals from January through September 2013. Most (67%) were unemployed, 75% arrived at the hospital by ambulance or police escort and 57% were admitted to the hospital. Use of ISDs has the potential to create a significant burden on the health care system and public services. Therefore, effective prevention and response strategies need to be developed.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724247","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.702841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.699639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Police","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Ambulance","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.229403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.17344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Public services","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_services"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Duluth, Minnesota","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Prostitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"}]}
