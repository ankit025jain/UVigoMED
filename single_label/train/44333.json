{"id":44333,"title":"Tumor-activated TCR??? T cells from gastric cancer patients induce the antitumor immune response of TCR??? T cells via their antigen-presenting cell-like effects.","abstract":"Human ?? T cells display the principal characteristics of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), in addition to playing a vital role in immunity through cytokine secretion and their cytotoxic activity. However, it is not clear whether ?? T cells perform APC-like functions under pathological conditions. In this study, we showed that, in contrast to peripheral-derived ?? T cells directly isolated from PBMCs of gastric cancer patients, tumor-activated ?? T cells not only killed tumor cells efficiently but also strongly induced primary CD4(+) and CD8(+) ?? T cells proliferation and differentiation. More importantly, they abrogated the immunosuppression induced by CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells and induced the cytotoxic function of CD8(+) ?? T cells from patients with gastric cancer. In conclusion, tumor-activated ?? T cells can induce adaptive immune responses through their APC-like functions, and these cells may be a potentially useful tool in the development of tumor vaccines and immunotherapy.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741609","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.712569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.594372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Antigen-presenting cell","weight":0.562363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.474442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.368093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"}]}
