{"id":29380,"title":"Natural evolution of skin-test sensitivity in patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.","abstract":"There are studies demonstrating that skin-test sensitivity to penicillins can decrease over time and that allergic patients may lose sensitivity if the responsible compounds are avoided. With regard to subjects with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, however, such studies are lacking. We evaluated prospectively in a 5-year follow-up 72 cephalosporin-allergic patients. After the first evaluation, patients were classified into two groups according to their patterns of allergologic-test positivity: to both penicillins and cephalosporins (group A), or only to cephalosporins (group B). Skin tests and serum-specific IgE assays were repeated 1 year later and, in case of persistent positivity, 3 and 5 years after the first allergologic examination. Seven (43.7%) of the 16 subjects of group A and 38 (67.8%) of the 56 patients of group B became negative; one was lost to follow-up. Patients of group B became negative sooner and more frequently than group A subjects.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673580","annotations":[{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.439395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.420661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.234985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
