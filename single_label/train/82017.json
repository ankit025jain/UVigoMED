{"id":82017,"title":"[A case of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in a patient who had received intravenous bisphosphonates].","abstract":"Bisphosphonates(BPs)have been widely used for the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with cancer, multiple myeloma bone diseases, and bone metastasis of solid cancers. Many cases of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ)have been reported in Japan. We report a case of a patient who developed BRONJ after tooth extraction even though the administration of BPs had been discontinued for 23 months. The patient was a 74-year-old woman who had received intravenous BPs from 2003 through 2008. She underwent tooth extraction in 2010. The bone in the extraction socket was exposed for more than 8 weeks. A clinical diagnosis of BRONJ was made. Discontinuation of BPs before surgical dental treatment did not appear to prevent BRONJ in this patient who had received intravenous BPs.
