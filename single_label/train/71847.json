{"id":71847,"title":"Co-mutated pathways analysis highlights the coordination mechanism in glioblastoma multiforme.","abstract":"The mutation of cancer represents a high heterogeneity characteristic, setting a big obstacle in the mechanism study of it. In this study, we explored the distributions of mutated genes in pathways in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and constructed networks of co-mutated pathway pairs under the false discovery rate (FDR) control. By comparing the mutation frequencies, a total of 50 mutated genes were screened with the frequency > 3, and TP53, PTEN, and EGFR were the top 3 genes. By KEGG enrichment, 18 pathways of the mutation gene spectrum of GBM were enriched. These pathways were further studied to explore the coordination between pathways, co-mutated pathway pairs, such as mismatch repair/vascular smooth muscle contraction, mismatch repair/long-term depression, mismatch repair/dopaminergic synapse, and TGF-beta signaling pathway/retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway were enriched in the network under FDR < 0.01; and cell cycle/p53 signaling was a co-mutated pathway pairs in the network under FDR < 0.05. Meanwhile, the samples overlap levels of enriched pathways were calculated for further confirming of the co-mutated pathway model. By the co-mutated pathway analysis, the coordination mechanism of cancer can be explored, and it may provide basis for the pathogenesis and combined therapy study of cancer.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027741","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.626455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.496111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.463093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.395115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.379134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Endocannabinoid","weight":0.344473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"KEGG","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KEGG"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Franklin D.
