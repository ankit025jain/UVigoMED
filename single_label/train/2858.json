{"id":2858,"title":"Evaluation of femtosecond laser-assisted and manual clear corneal incisions and their effect on surgically induced astigmatism and higher-order aberrations.","abstract":"To evaluate femtosecond laser-assisted and manual clear corneal incisions and their effect on surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) and corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs).In a prospective randomized study, conventional phacoemulsification with a 2.8-mm clear corneal incision using a disposable keratome was performed in 20 eyes of 20 patients (manual group), and femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with a 2.8-mm biplanar clear corneal tunnel created by a femtosecond laser (LenSx; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA) was performed in 20 eyes of 20 patients (femtosecond laser group). Corneal topography readings and corneal wavefront aberrations (diameter: 9.0 mm) were obtained using a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam HR; Oculus Optikgerate, Wetzlar, Germany) preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively.There was no significant difference in SIA between the groups (femtosecond laser group: 0.47 ± 0.13 vs manual group: 0.41 ± 0.14; P = .218), but the axis deviation of the SIA axis from the previously planned axis was significantly smaller in the femtosecond laser group compared to the manual group (4.47°± 2.59° vs 7.38°± 4.72°, respectively; P = .048). Corneal HOAs increased significantly in both groups (femtosecond laser group: 0.13 ± 0.09 to 0.18 ± 0.12, P = .025; manual group: 0.13 ± 0.05 to 0.15 ± 0.05, P = .002), but preoperative and postoperative values did not differ significantly between them (P = .472 and .078, respectively). Lower-order and total corneal aberration values remained stable in both groups (P > .05).There was no difference in SIA and induced HOAs between manual and femtosecond laser-created clear corneal incisions.","date":"2014-10-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25325892","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.616582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.521892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.515849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.408367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Aliso Viejo, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliso_Viejo,_California"},{"name":"Wetzlar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetzlar"},{"name":"Alcon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Scheimpflug principle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheimpflug_principle"},{"name":"Aliso","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliso"},{"name":"Sia","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sia"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Oculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
