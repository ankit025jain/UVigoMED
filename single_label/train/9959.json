{"id":9959,"title":"Urogenital surgery performed with the mare standing.","abstract":"Many urogenital procedures of the mare are commonly performed with the mare standing. Ovariectomy via colpotomy was described as early as 1903, and the Caslick vulvoplasty was first described in 1937. As knowledge expands and instruments become more specialized, techniques will improve. With the introduction of laparoscopy, clinicians have not only been able to improve the previously described urogenital procedures but also to devise new procedures. This article describes multiple surgeries of the female urogenital tract, all of which can be performed with the mare standing, and describes a variety of approaches to some portions of the female urogenital tract.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680212","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.679559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.148553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare"},{"name":"1903","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"}]}
