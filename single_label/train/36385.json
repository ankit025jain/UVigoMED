{"id":36385,"title":"Unroofing intramural coronary artery for late coronary events after arterial switch operation.","abstract":"The incidence of intramural coronary arteries in patients with transposition of the great arteries is relatively rare. Intramural coronary arteries are highly associated with early and late coronary adverse events. We report a case of late coronary events caused by an intramural left coronary artery, which was successfully treated by the unroofing procedure.
