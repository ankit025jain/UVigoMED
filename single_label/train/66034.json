{"id":66034,"title":"[Value of dual-phase (18)F-FDG PET/CT in preoperative staging of bladder cancer].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical value of dual-phase (18)F-FDG PET/CT with oral diuretics in preoperative staging of bladder cancer.The imaging data were analyzed of 73 patients with bladder cancer undergoing preoperative dual-phase (18)F-FDG PET/CT with oral diuretic between May, 2003 and May, 2012. All the patients underwent whole-body PET/CT scan 60 min after intravenous injection of 270-350 MBq of (18)F-FDG. Additional delayed pelvic PET/CT images were acquired after forced diuresis using oral furosemide (40 mg). All the patients underwent subsequent radical cystectomy, and (18)F-FDG PET/CT findings were compared with the histopathologic results to evaluate the value of dual-phase (18)F-FDG PET/CT in preoperative staging.The concordance rate of dual-phase FDG PET/CT-based bladder cancer staging with the histopathologic results was 63.0% in the 73 patients, and was 100% (7/7) for pT4 bladder cancers. With dual-phase FDG PET/CT, the detection rate was 75.0% (6/8) for lymph node metastases, 100% (4/4) for distant metastases, and 100% (4/4) for other concurrent primary malignancies.Though with limited accuracy in T-staging of pTa, pT1, pT2, and pT3 bladder cancer, dual-phase FDG PET/CT has important clinical value in staging of pT4 bladder cancer and in N-staging, M-staging and detection of other concurrent primary malignancies.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752096","annotations":[{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.886475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.737514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.621806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.558927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.535986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.39285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Furosemide","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furosemide"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.288552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.115315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
