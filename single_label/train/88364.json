{"id":88364,"title":"Comparison between arthroscopic partial and total meniscectomy of medial meniscus in non-professional athletes.","abstract":"Large number of patients suffers from medial meniscus injury during athletic activities despite of not being involved in professional sports. Our goal was to compare clinical and functional outcome of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with results of arthroscopic total meniscectomy of the medial meniscus in these non-professional athletes. The prospective interventional study was carried out in a five years period from January 2007 to December 2011. According to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria 109 patients were selected and underwent surgery but 29 patients lost from follow-up. Results of 40 cases with Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (Group-I) and 40 cases with arthroscopic total meniscectomy (Group-II) were analyzed. There were 75 male patients and the predominant age group was 21-30 years. Patients were followed up for a range of 36-60 months. Standard questionnaires of Visual Analogue Score (VAS), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner-Lysholm Knee Score (TLKS) and Tapper and Hoover criteria was used to assess and compare the outcomes. Radiological assessment was done to note any changes. Students were sufferers in majority cases and bucket handle tear had been the commonest type. Significant difference of clinical, functional and radiological outcome was observed at minimum 3 years follow up. One case needed revision in Group-II and the infection rates were insignificant. Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is significantly better method for surgical management of medial meniscus injuries.
