{"id":64600,"title":"[Evolutionary admonition: allergy].","abstract":"The paper concerns phylogeny development of allergic reactivity, the most probable antecedents of allergic IgE antibodies, high affinity IgE receptor (Fc(epsilon)RI), presents comparative character of IgE - Fc(epsilon)RI and IgY- CHIR-AB1 interactions. The paper has given an insight of allergy as evolutionary selected reactivity for highly organized animals. This reactivity is directed to organization of allergen-specific inflammation and serves as biologically expedient, high-specific and high-sensitive reaction in response to allergen entering into the organism because of barrier tissue dysfunction. Such insight has raised a question on consequences of thoroughgoing allergy reactivity elimination for highly organized animals and their posterity.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051686","annotations":[{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.6439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.243346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.238481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Admonition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admonition"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Comparative linguistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"}]}
