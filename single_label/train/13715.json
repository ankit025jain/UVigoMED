{"id":13715,"title":"SIV vpx is essential for macrophage infection but not for development of AIDS.","abstract":"Analysis of rhesus macaques infected with a vpx deletion mutant virus of simian immunodeficiency virus mac239 (SIV?vpx) demonstrates that Vpx is essential for efficient monocyte/macrophage infection in vivo but is not necessary for development of AIDS. To compare myeloid-lineage cell infection in monkeys infected with SIV?vpx compared to SIVmac239, we analyzed lymphoid and gastrointestinal tissues from SIV?vpx-infected rhesus (n?=?5), SIVmac239-infected rhesus with SIV encephalitis (7 SIV239E), those without encephalitis (4 SIV239noE), and other SIV mutant viruses with low viral loads (4 SIV?nef, 2 SIV?3). SIV+ macrophages and the percentage of total SIV+ cells that were macrophages in spleen and lymph nodes were significantly lower in rhesus infected with SIV?vpx (2.2%) compared to those infected with SIV239E (22.7%), SIV239noE (8.2%), and SIV mutant viruses (10.1%). In colon, SIV?vpx monkeys had fewer SIV+ cells, no SIV+ macrophages, and lower percentage of SIV+ cells that were macrophages than the other 3 groups. Only 2 SIV?vpx monkeys exhibited detectable virus in the colon. We demonstrate that Vpx is essential for efficient macrophage infection in vivo and that simian AIDS and death can occur in the absence of detectable macrophage infection.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465411","annotations":[{"name":"Simian immunodeficiency virus","weight":0.936512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Rhesus macaque","weight":0.793451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Simian","weight":0.63568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.614434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.319148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.176781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"}]}
