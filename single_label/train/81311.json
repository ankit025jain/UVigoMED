{"id":81311,"title":"Submorphotypes of the maxillary first molar and their effects on alignment and rotation.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to explore the shape differences in maxillary first molars with orthographic measurements using 3-dimensional virtual models to assess whether there is variability in morphology that could affect the alignment results when treated by straight-wire appliance systems.A total of 175 maxillary first molars with 4 cusps were selected for classification. With 3-dimensional laser scanning and reconstruction software, virtual casts were constructed. After performing several linear and angular measurements on the virtual occlusal plane, the teeth were clustered into 2 groups by the method of partitioning around medoids. To visualize the 2 groups, occlusal polygons were constructed using the average data of these groups.The resultant 2 clusters showed statistically significant differences in the measurements describing the cusp locations and the buccal and lingual outlines. The rotation along the centers made the 2 cluster polygons look similar, but there was a difference in the direction of the midsagittal lines.There was considerable variability in morphology according to 2 clusters in the population of this study. The occlusal polygons showed that the outlines of the 2 clusters were similar, but the midsagittal line directions and inner geometries were different. The difference between the morphologies of the 2 clusters could result in occlusal contact differences, which might be considered for better alignment of the maxillary posterior segment.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Stomatognathic
