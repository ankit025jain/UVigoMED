{"id":37989,"title":"Prenatal tricuspid valve size as a predictor of postnatal outcome in patients with severe pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum.","abstract":"Tricuspid valve (TV) size at birth correlates with intervention strategy in patients with severe pulmonary stenosis (SPS) or pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS). Prenatal features that might predict postnatal TV size have not been well studied. We hypothesized that prenatal echocardiographic measurements predict the postnatal TV Z-score in fetuses with SPS and PA/IVS.We identified 16 neonates (gestational age 28 Â± 4.8 weeks) with a fetal diagnosis of SPS or PA/IVS from 2001 to 2010. Measurements were performed offline. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis was used to generate AUC (areas under the curve) for each of the variables.AUC was 0.94 for tricuspid to mitral valve (TV/MV) ratio, 0.88 for TV Z-score, and 0.85 for TV inflow duration. A cut-off value of >0.63 for TV/MV yielded a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 100% for predicting postnatal TV Z-score >-3. Neonates with TV Z-score ?-3 and all fetuses with antegrade flow across the pulmonary valve or more than moderate tricuspid regurgitation had biventricular circulation in follow-up.Fetal TV/MV >0.63 predicts favorable TV Z-score at birth in patients with SPS and PA/IVS. Antegrade pulmonary valve flow and more than moderate tricuspid regurgitation also conferred a favorable outcome.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457468","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonic stenosis","weight":0.883109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonic_stenosis"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Pulmonary valve","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_valve"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.80704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.535661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.509087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Tricuspid insufficiency","weight":0.410886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_insufficiency"},{"name":"Pulmonary atresia","weight":0.371491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_atresia"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
