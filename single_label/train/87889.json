{"id":87889,"title":"Occupational needs and intervention strategies for military personnel with mild traumatic brain injury and persistent post-concussion symptoms: a review.","abstract":"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, has been labeled the \"signature injury\" of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A subset of military personnel with mTBI experience ongoing symptoms well beyond the normal recovery window. While much research has been dedicated to understanding the etiology and severity of the symptoms, very little has assessed how long-term symptoms impact participation in daily life. A scoping study of the occupational science and occupational therapy literature was conducted to ascertain the current state of research on the impact of mTBI on participation in daily life activities, as well as occupational therapy interventions for mTBI. Although the emphasis in this article is on military personnel with mTBI, studies on civilians with mTBI were included in the review as research with military populations is extremely limited. Based on the literature reviewed, the author suggests a role for occupational science research and occupational therapy practice in meeting the occupational needs of military service members with persistent symptoms after mTBI.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972412","annotations":[{"name":"Afghanistan","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"},{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.814343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.709192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"War","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Iraq War","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.38982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.311293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.301339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.284485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Civilian","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.153714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Military service","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Signature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"}]}
