{"id":16604,"title":"A Delphi exercise to refine the WHO three-point disability grading system for leprosy, and to develop guidelines to promote greater accuracy and reliability of WHO disability recording.","abstract":"A Delphi Exercise was undertaken with two objectives: (1) To ascertain whether operational definitions for WHO Disability Grading could be formulated by consensus. (2) To develop a set of simple guidelines based on those definitions for the guidance of health workers. Fifteen people with general expertise in prevention of disability due to leprosy were invited to participate as Delphi panel members, twelve responded positively. Eight issues that commonly cause confusion provided foci for the exercise. Operational definitions aimed at resolving those issues were developed by consensus. Simple guidelines for health workers, based on those definitions were also created and supported by consensus. This paper presents the process followed and the outcomes gained from the endeavour.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974439","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.724617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.324882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.169978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Delphi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Operational definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"}]}
