{"id":36527,"title":"Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary sequestration.","abstract":"A 5-day-old girl who had pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, intralobar pulmonary sequestration of the right lower lobe, and retroesophageal innominate vein, was referred to our institution. We successfully performed a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. During cardiopulmonary bypass, the arteries supplying the sequestrated lung were ligated above the diaphragm through the median sternotomy, without a thoracotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and we avoided the potential complications of lung infection and ventricular overload.
