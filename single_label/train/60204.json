{"id":60204,"title":"[Clinical assessment of CD4/8 ratio of bone marrow lymphocytes in acquired pure red cell aplasia].","abstract":"We have reviewed 6 patients with acquired PRCA and investigated CD4/8 ratio in the bone marrow lymphocytes prior to treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA). CsA, as a remission induction therapy, produced CR in 3/6 patients, and PR+NR in 3/6 patients. CD4/8 ratio in CR group was high compared to PR+NR group. Moreover, the number of reticulocyte and hemoglobin concentration in CR group was high in comparison with PR+NR group. In acquired PRCA, CD4/8 ratio in the bone marrow lymphocytes may correlate with the disease status and the outcome of CsA treatment.
