Results from micro-arrays were considered as the gold standard. An analysis on 489 isolates resulted in a sensitivity of 98.9?% and a specificity of 100?% for the PCR.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473202","annotations":[{"name":"Gold","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.222269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.14971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"}]}
