{"id":36562,"title":"WINROP can modify ROP screening praxis: a validation of WINROP in populations in Sörmland and Västmanland.","abstract":"This study validates the newly developed WINROP algorithm aimed at detecting retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) requiring treatment at an early stage. The study was conducted at two middle-sized hospitals in Sweden, prospectively and retrospectively.A total of 104 children participated in this study. Their mean gestational age at birth was 28.7 weeks (range, 23.6-32.1 weeks), and their mean birth weight was 1208 g (range, 477-2340 g). Weekly weight measurements were used in WINROP to calculate the risk of developing ROP.80% of infants (83/104) had no ROP, 15% (16/104) had mild ROP (stage 1 or 2), 5% (5/104) had severe ROP, and 2% (2/104) were treated for ROP. The alarm was registered at an average of 2 weeks postnatal age (range 1-6 weeks).WINROP identified all the infants at risk for developing stage 3 ROP (100% sensitivity) and had a 59% specificity. The alarm was registered several weeks before screening for ROP began. WINROP can be used to complement conventional ROP screening.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568873","annotations":[{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.813255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.783309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Retinopathy of prematurity","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy_of_prematurity"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.330676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.159155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Praxis (process)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"632","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/632"},{"name":"1208","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1208"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Alarm devices","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_devices"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"2100s (decade)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2100s_(decade)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"California Association of Regional Occupational Centers and Programs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Association_of_Regional_Occupational_Centers_and_Programs"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"}]}
