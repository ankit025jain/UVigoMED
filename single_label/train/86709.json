{"id":86709,"title":"Prognosis associated with surgery for non-small cell lung cancer and synchronous brain metastasis.","abstract":"Several reports have described extended survival after aggressive surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and synchronous brain metastasis. This retrospective analysis assesses the prognostic factors in this population.We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of 29 patients with synchronous brain metastasis from NSCLC, who underwent surgical treatment in our institution between 1980 and 2008. All patients underwent chest surgery to remove the primary lesion. The impact of several variables on survival was assessed.The median follow-up period was 9.6 months and the 5-year survival rate from the time of lung cancer resection was 20.6 %. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, primary tumor size, and the presence of lymph node involvement were predictive of overall survival (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis also identified those factors to be independent favorable prognostic factors.Although the survival of patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer remains poor, surgical resection may benefit a select group of patients, particularly those with a normal CEA level, small tumor size, and node-negative status.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748535","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.723407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.507387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Thoracic surgery","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
