{"id":6795,"title":"Activation of extrinsic- and Daxx-mediated pathways in lymphoid tissue of PRRSV-infected pigs.","abstract":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is a major infectious pathogen in pigs leading to huge economical losses worldwide. PRRSV is able to escape from host immunity and causes transient infections. In the present study, expression of different apoptotic markers and its connection with PRRSV were assessed in tonsil and mediastinal lymph node from PRRSV-infected pigs. Cleaved caspase (CCasp)8, CCasp9, Fas, Daxx, CCasp3 and PRRSV expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. An up-regulation of CCasp8, Fas and CCasp3 expression in lymphocytes and macrophages from both organs was found during PRRSV infection, indicating the activation of the extrinsic-mediated pathway of apoptosis. Moreover, Daxx expression was also enhanced in macrophages of both organs, suggesting a simultaneous caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis. A correlation between the expression of the different apoptotic markers and IL-10, IL-6 and TGF-? but not with PRRSV antigen was found in our study, which supports the hypothesis of an indirect mechanism in PRRSV-induced apoptosis.
