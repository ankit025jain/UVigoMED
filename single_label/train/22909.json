{"id":22909,"title":"Deep neck abscess in neonatal period: case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Deep neck abscess is very rare in neonatal period. We reported a deep neck abscess caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection (MSSA) in a neonate. A 10-day male infant was admitted to our neonatal unit with the complaints of fever, irritability, and refused to food intake. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed as an abscess in the neck. Needle aspiration from abscess revealed pus. Antibiotics and drainage were applied. We also reviewed the neonatal deep neck abscess reported in English literature and clinical presentation, risk factors, causing microorganisms, treatment, complication and outcome of deep neck abscesses were discussed.
