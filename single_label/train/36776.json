{"id":36776,"title":"Congenital High Airway Obstruction Syndrome (CHAOS) as part of Fraser syndrome: ultrasound and autopsy findings.","abstract":"Congenital High Airway Obstruction Syndrome (CHAOS) is a potential lethal condition. We describe a case report of CHAOS, with additional malformations diagnosed at 20 weeks. Autopsy findings are suggestive for Fraser syndrome (cryptophthalmos-syndactyly syndrome; OMIM 219000). The diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis of FRAS1.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551978","annotations":[{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.726358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Royal Astronomical Society","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society"},{"name":"Fraser syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_syndrome"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Obstruction of justice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice"}]}
