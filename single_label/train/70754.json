{"id":70754,"title":"A review of the Christchurch Hospital Breast Cancer Service in 2012: meeting the new Tumour Standards.","abstract":"To determine whether patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 received timely access to services at Christchurch Hospital when audited against Ministry of Health Tumour Standards of Service Provision (TS) (2013) and the Faster Cancer Treatment (FCT) indicators, and to discover factors which impeded patient pathways, and which would need to be addressed in order to meet the standards.Data on referrals, dates and treatment for patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Christchurch Hospital was extracted from the Christchurch Breast Cancer Patient Register and other hospital databases.In 2012, 288 breast cancer patients were treated at Christchurch Hospital, 60% referred by general practitioners, and 40% via the national screening programme. Some 2013 Tumour Standards were achieved. The FCT indicator 1 (TS 2.4) and 3 (TS 2.5) were met, with 87% (greater than or equal to 80%) receiving their first treatment within 62 days of referral, and 89% (greater than or equal to 80%) within 31 days of decision-to-treat. However, FCT indicator 2 (TS 2.1), requiring first specialist assessment within 14 days of referral, was met in 61% (greater than or equal to 90% required). Only 64% of women started adjuvant chemotherapy within 42 days of their surgery (TS 2.6, greater than or equal to 90%).The management of breast cancer patients by a multidisciplinary team is crucial to ensure patients receive timely and appropriate care. However, waiting for weekly multidisciplinary meetings and adequate anatomical pathology resource, together with other factors, were identified as delaying the patient pathway and solutions to resolve these are discussed.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145307","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical pathology","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.694294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.263112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Christchurch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch"},{"name":"Christchurch Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_Hospital"},{"name":"Enigma machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Inequality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
