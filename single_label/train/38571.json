{"id":38571,"title":"[Sebaceous breast carcinoma: report of a rare histological special subtype].","abstract":"We report on a case of sebaceous carcinoma of the breast as a rare histological special subtype of breast cancer. Because these tumors are uncommon, differential diagnostic considerations and the exclusion of Muir-Torre syndrome are emphasized. Finally possible mechanisms of development and therapeutic strategies for this carcinoma are discussed.
