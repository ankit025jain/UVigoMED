{"id":33216,"title":"Chromosome aberrations identified by cytogenetic analysis of the first two clones of cultured amniotic fluid cells compared with QF-PCR results.","abstract":"We report on our experience of studying amniotic fluid cells by cytogenetic analysis (CA) of the first 2 clones. We investigated the incidence and types of chromosome aberrations detected by CA of 196 amniocenteses performed on pregnant women at high risk. Of these cases, 178 were analysed by QF-PCR (risk group A). The results were compared with the data obtained by CA of 1,263 amniocenteses carried out in patients with other indications. QF-PCR was used to investigate 1,030 of these cases (risk group B). The combined average turnaround time for a CA result of the first 2 clones in both risk groups was within 9 ± 2 days. The final CA results (?6 clones) were obtained within 12 ± 4 days. In risk group A, CA was not possible in 2 cases due to cell culture failure. The foetal karyotype was abnormal in 13.8% of the cases by CA of ?6 clones and in 13.5% of the cases by QF-PCR. Together, CA of ?6 clones and QF-PCR detected chromosome aberrations in 14.8% of the cases. With the exception of 2 cases of in vitro culture failure and 1 case with low gonosomal mosaicism, CA of the first 2 clones detected all cases with chromosome aberrations. Five cases with clinically significant chromosome aberrations were not detected by QF-PCR. In risk group B, the foetal karyotype was found to be abnormal in 2.2% of the cases by CA of ?6 clones and in 1.0% of the cases by QF-PCR. Together, CA of ?6 clones and QF-PCR revealed chromosome aberrations in 2.2% of the cases. With the exception of 1 case with low gonosomal mosaicism, CA of the first 2 clones detected all other cases with chromosome aberrations. The majority of these cases were inherited chromosome aberrations. Eighteen cases with chromosome aberrations were not detected by QF-PCR. Based on our results, CA of ?6 clones, together with QF-PCR as a first test, should be performed in all prenatal cases with abnormal ultrasound findings. In pregnancies with other indications, CA of the first 2 clones alone is sufficient to identify all clinically significant (and inherited) chromosome aberrations.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853086","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mosaic (genetics)","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.549719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.482012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.38448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Turnaround (filmmaking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"List of SPC high-risk days","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SPC_high-risk_days"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
