{"id":3440,"title":"[The study of profile of hypersensitivity to pollen and fungal allergens in the Moscow region].","abstract":"The profile of hypersensitivity to pollen and fungal allergens is an important element of common pattern of immune diseases needed for development of effective pharmaceuticals. The purpose of the study was to analyze the rate of detection of combined forms of hypersensitivity to pollen and fungal allergens (pollen of birch, hazel, cocksfoot, wormwood, fungi A. alternata, C. herbarum, R. nigricans, P. notatum, C. albicans, A. fumigatus) in the Moscow region on the basis of data of scarification skin samples. The mono-sensibilization was established in 23.36% of all cases of hypersensitivity. At that, among leading allergens turned out A. alternata and cocksfoot pollen (6.54% and 4.67%), followed by allergens of wormwood pollen, P. notatum, R. nigricans, birch pollen and C. albicans (3.74%, 3.74%, 1.87%, 1.87% and 0.93% correspondingly). The polysensibilization was established in 51.40% of cases. Besides, the combined hypersensitivity to pollen allergens of plants (20.26%) and to pollen and fungal allergens (20.56%) occurred more frequently In the group of patients with polysensibilization predominated combined allergic reactions to pollen allergens and A. alternata allergens (36.36%). On the whole, most frequently occurred sensitization to allergens of birch, hazel, cocksfoot, wormwood and A. alternata allergen (76.14%, 69.32%, 57.95%, 55.68%, 39.77% and 56.82% correspondingly). In the Moscow region predominate combined forms of hypersensitivity to two and more pollen and fungal allergens. The polysensitization to pollen allergens and A. alternata allergen occurs more frequently.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338462","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.73549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.584724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Aspergillus fumigatus","weight":0.580603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_fumigatus"},{"name":"Birch","weight":0.423057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.386952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Penicillium chrysogenum","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium_chrysogenum"},{"name":"Hazel","weight":0.140405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazel"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Rhizopus nigricans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizopus_nigricans"},{"name":"Artemisia (plant)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_(plant)"},{"name":"Dactylis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Paspalum notatum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paspalum_notatum"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"},{"name":"Schoenus nigricans","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoenus_nigricans"},{"name":"Moscow Oblast","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Oblast"}]}
