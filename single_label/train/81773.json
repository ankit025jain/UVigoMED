{"id":81773,"title":"Does stress predispose to periodontal disease?","abstract":"The relationship of a sound mind to the maintenance of a healthy body has been recognized throughout most of recorded history. The term 'stress' is used to describe adverse emotions or reactions to unpleasant experiences. Individuals with high levels of stress and poor coping skills experience twice as much periodontal disease as compared to those with minimal stress and good coping skills. Although stress may predispose an individual to more destruction from periodontitis, the presence of periodontal pathogens remains the essential aetiologic factor. This review presents a summary of stress, discussing how it can predispose an individual to periodontal disease.Stress, which is a universal phenomenon, is implicated to have various systemic effects besides being a risk factor for periodontal disease. This article elucidates the relationship between psycho-social stress and destructive periodontal disease.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839715","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.510716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.304958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.124383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Sanity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Universality (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Recorded history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
