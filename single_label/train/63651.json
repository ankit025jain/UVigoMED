{"id":63651,"title":"Developmental plasticity of red blood cell homeostasis.","abstract":"Most human physiologic set points like body temperature are tightly regulated and show little variation between healthy individuals. Red blood cell (RBC) characteristics such as hematocrit and mean cell volume are stable within individuals but can vary by 20% from one healthy person to the next. The mechanisms for the majority of this inter-individual variation are unknown and do not appear to involve common genetic variation. Here, we show that environmental conditions present during development, namely in utero iron availability, can exert long-term influence on a set point related to the RBC life cycle. In a controlled study of rhesus monkeys and a retrospective study of humans, we use a mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to show that in utero iron deficiency is associated with a lowered threshold for RBC clearance and turnover. This in utero effect is plastic, persisting at least 2 years after birth and after the cessation of iron deficiency. Our study reports a rare instance of developmental plasticity in the human hematologic system and also shows how mathematical modeling can be used to identify cellular mechanisms involved in the adaptive control of homeostatic set points.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
