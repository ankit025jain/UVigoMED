{"id":83990,"title":"The impact of surgeon handedness in total hip replacement.","abstract":"Total hip replacement (THR) is successful and performed commonly. Component placement is a determinant of outcome. Influence of surgeon handedness on component placement has not been considered previously. This study was a radiographic assessment of component positioning with respect to handedness. Early data from 160 patients are reported.Overall, 160 primary THRs for osteoarthritis were included. Equal numbers of left and right THRs were performed by four surgeons, two right-handed and two left-handed. Postoperative radiography was assessed for THR component position by measurement of leg length inequality, acetabular inclination and centre of rotation. Surgeons' handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh inventory.For leg length inequality, no significant interaction was seen between hip side and surgeon handedness. Acetabular inclination angles showed a statistically significant difference, however, depending on hand dominance, with higher inclination angles recorded when operating on the dominant side. There was a trend towards greater medialisation of the centre of rotation on the non-dominant side although this did not reach statistical significance.Surgeon handedness appears to influence acetabular component position during THR but it is one factor of many that interact to achieve a successful outcome.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198975","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.683353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.576776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.23704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.211204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Handedness","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Edinburgh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Component video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video"},{"name":"Left-handedness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handedness"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical abbreviations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation,_aerospace_and_aeronautical_abbreviations"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
