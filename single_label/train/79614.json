{"id":79614,"title":"Hymenolepis diminuta: analysis of the expression of Toll-like receptor genes and protein (TLR3 and TLR9) in the small and large intestines of rats.","abstract":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a fundamental role in the rapid activation of innate immune responses to a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In a previous study we observed an increase in the level of expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA in the jejunum and colon during experimental hymenolepidosis in rats. In this study, we performed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining of TLR3 and TLR9 receptors during experimental hymenolepidosis in rats. The levels of mRNA and protein expression of TLR3 and TLR9 in the jejunum had increased at 16 days post Hymenolepis diminuta infection (dpi) in the case of TLR3 and at 16 and 25 dpi in the case of TLR9. In the colon the expression of TLR3 and TLR9 had increased at 16, 25 and 40 dpi. The results of the immunohistochemical reactions showed that H. diminuta infected rats (16, 25, 40 and 60 dpi) exhibited changes in TLR3 and TLR9 localization and intensity in the epithelial cells of the jejunum and colon. The changes in the level of TLR3 and TLR9 expression may confirm involvement of the innate immune system in the pathomechanism of hymenolepidosis.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092440","annotations":[{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.90928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.770627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.751733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.748529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.723855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.715845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"TLR 2","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_2"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.638055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.617411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.51722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Pathogen-associated molecular pattern","weight":0.197377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen-associated_molecular_pattern"},{"name":"TLR 4","weight":0.136923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_4"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"TLR 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_3"},{"name":"TLR9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR9"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
