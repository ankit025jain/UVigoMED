{"id":64052,"title":"[Intestine microbiota and allergic diseases].","abstract":"In industrialized countries an increased number of diseases due to immune system disorders including connected with allergy is noted. Allergic diseases generally proceed against the background of various common inflammatory diseases arising in childhood. The role of intestine microflora in its interaction with immune system and defining factors in allergization of children are actively studied. A decrease of risk of allergy development later in life for children who had grown up in the countryside was shown to be possibly related with microorganisms present in food. Thus the positive potential of farms is currently examined as a result of innate immunity activation by using microbial components. Acinetobacter lwoffii F78 isolated from cowsheds is able to protect mice from experimental allergy by activating Th1-polarization program of dendritic cells. Moreover, an important role in pathogenesis of allergic diseases belongs to mast cells. Probiotic lactobacilli may weaken activation of mast cells and release of inflammation mediators connected with allergic reactions. The ability of intestine microflora to influence immune response resulted in novel approaches in therapy that use these differences in microbiota for therapy and prophylaxis in allergy patients. And therefore on the basis of \"hygiene hypothesis\" of allergy emergence, a consideration is expressed that early manipulation with intestinal microbial communities may offer a new strategy of allergic sensibilization prevention.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286512","annotations":[{"name":"Hygiene hypothesis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.638952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.562867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.364692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Industrialisation","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Factory farming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
