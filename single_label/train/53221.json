{"id":53221,"title":"Obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes: investigating the role of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in mid-life in the 1958 British cohort.","abstract":"A key public health priority is to minimise obesity-related health consequences. We aim to establish whether physical activity (PA) or less sedentary behaviour ameliorate associations of obesity with biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes.Data on obesity (33 y), PA (42 y), TV-viewing and health biomarkers (45 y) are from the 1958 British birth cohort (N=9377).Obesity was associated with an adverse biomarker profile for CVD and type 2 diabetes. For PA, men active?1/week had 1.09% (0.28, 1.90) lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) than less active men; triglycerides were 2.08% (0.52, 3.64) lower per unit higher PA (on 4-point scale). TV-viewing was independently associated with several biomarkers, e.g. per unit higher TV-viewing (on 4-point scale) DBP was raised by 0.50% (0.09, 0.90) and triglycerides by 3.61% (1.58, 5.64). For both TV-viewing and PA, associations with HbA1c were greatest for the obese (pinteraction?0.04): compared to a reference value of 5.20 HbA1c% in non-obese men viewing 0-1 h/day, HbA1c% differed little for those viewing>3 h/day; among obese men HbA1c% was 5.36 (5.22, 5.51) and 5.65 (5.53, 5.76), for 0-1 and >3 h/day respectively. For PA in non-obese men, the reduction associated with activity?1/week was negligible compared to a reference value of 5.20 HbA1c% for those less active; but there was a reduction among obese men, HbA1c% was 5.50 (5.40, 5.59) vs 5.66 (5.55, 5.77) respectively.Reduced TV-viewing and prevention of infrequent activity have greatest beneficial associations for glucose metabolism among the obese, with benefits for other biomarkers across obese and non-obese groups.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530764","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.771518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.386317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.25973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.226731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Negligible","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
