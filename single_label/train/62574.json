{"id":62574,"title":"Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with stem cell transplantation in patients with imatinib-refractory chronic myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains a curative therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia with advanced diseases, but limited data exist on the efficacy of short-time 2nd-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used before and after allo-SCT for patients failing imatinib therapy.We present a single-center report of a series of 12 imatinib-refractory patients in advanced phases, 9 of whom harbored BCR-ABL1 mutations. All of them were treated with 2nd TKI, followed by allo-SCT.Dasatinib or nilotinib reinduced complete hematologic responses in 11 patients and complete cytogenetic responses in 4 patients. All patients engrafted successfully. Five patients experienced acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), including 4 with grade III-IV disease. Four patients experienced chronic GVHD, including 1 with extensive disease. Post-transplant prophylactic dasatinib or nilotinb was administrated in 9 patients and discontinued 1 year later, all of whom sustained complete molecular remission, even after a median follow-up of 13 months after withdrawal of the TKI. No hematologic relapse was observed. Four patients died: 1 of primary disease and 3 of transplant-related complications. After a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 12-37 months) after SCT, 8 (66.7%) of 12 patients are alive, including 7 with complete molecular remission.Allo-SCT has a satisfactory outcome when combined with 2nd-generation TKI, which could provide a good quality of remission before transplantation and prevent relapse after transplantation.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553398","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.828778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogeneic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.774736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.660734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.595993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.453101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.441591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.437146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.311658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
