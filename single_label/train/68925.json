{"id":68925,"title":"[CCAFU Recommendations 2013: Penile cancer].","abstract":"Malignant tumours of the penis are rare tumours. The objective of this article is to propose guidelines for the management of these tumours.A review of the literature was performed by selecting articles on penile cancer published in PUBMED.The most common histological type is squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical examination of the penis is usually sufficient to assess local extension of the primary tumour, but it can be completed by MRI to assess deeper extension. Inguinal lymph nodes must be systematically palpated on both sides to assess regional extension. In the presence of palpable lymph nodes, aspiration cytology is recommended in combination with abdomen and pelvis computed tomography and (18)F-FDG PET-CT. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended in the case of penile cancer at high risk of lymph node extension with no palpable lymph nodes. Treatment of the primary tumour is usually surgical. It must be as conservative as possible while ensuring negative surgical margins. Brachytherapy or local treatment (laser, cytotoxic cream, etc.) can be proposed in some cases. Bilateral lymph node chains must be systematically treated at the time of diagnosis of the disease. Inguinal lymphadenectomy alone has a curative role in patients with metastatic invasion of a single lymph node (stage pN1). In the case of more extensive lymph node involvement, multimodal management combining chemotherapy, surgery and possibly radiotherapy, must be considered.The treatment of penile cancer is usually surgical possibly in combination with chemotherapy in the presence of lymph node extension. The main prognostic factor is lymph node involvement, requiring appropriate management right from the time of diagnosis.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485288","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.898451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.868908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.767869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.752328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.723007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Carcinoma of the penis","weight":0.649422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_of_the_penis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.6422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.44844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.392673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
