{"id":38326,"title":"Prenatal diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome for fetuses with suspicious deletion of chromosomal region 15q11-q13.","abstract":"To identify Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) among fetuses with suspicious deletion of the chromosomal region 15q11-q13.In a retrospective study, data were assessed from fetuses missing chromosomal band 15q12 that underwent molecular diagnosis at the National Chen-Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, between January 2001 and December 2012. Amniocytes were subjected to molecular testing, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, methylation-specific PCR (M-PCR), and methylation-specific multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA).During the 12-year study period, 26 041 amniocyte samples were analyzed at the study center and 27 (0.1%) were found to have a missing 15q12 band. A further 16 samples with a missing 15q12 band were received from other cytogenetic laboratories; as a result, 43 amniocyte samples lacking chromosomal band 15q12 underwent further molecular testing. Among these samples, 3 fetuses (7.0%) were found to have PWS (n=1) or AS (n=2).A minority of cases with missing 15q12 had deletion of the PWS/AS critical region. This finding draws attention to the subtle structural rearrangements that occur on 15q11-q13 and provides useful information for prenatal diagnosis of PWS and AS.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434231","annotations":[{"name":"Angelman syndrome","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelman_syndrome"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.843613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.454017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.435876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.265779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.256946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.153654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
