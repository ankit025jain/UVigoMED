{"id":30568,"title":"Framing ethnic variations in alcohol outcomes from biological pathways to neighborhood context.","abstract":"Health disparities research seeks to eliminate disproportionate negative health outcomes experienced in some racial/ethnic minority groups. This brief review presents findings on factors associated with drinking and alcohol-related problems in racial/ethnic groups.Those discussed are as follows: (i) biological pathways to alcohol problems, (ii) gene Ã— stress interactions, (iii) neighborhood disadvantage, stress, and access to alcohol, and (iv) drinking cultures and contexts.These factors and their interrelationships are complex, requiring a multilevel perspective.The use of interdisciplinary teams and an epigenetic focus are suggested to move the research forward. The application of multilevel research to policy, prevention, and intervention programs may help prioritize combinations of the most promising intervention targets.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483624","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.810682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.649616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.589789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.398588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.337968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Neighbourhood","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Disproportionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disproportionation"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},{"name":"Test preparation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_preparation"}]}
