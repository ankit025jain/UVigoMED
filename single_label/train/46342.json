{"id":46342,"title":"Completion surgery following transanal endoscopic microsurgery: assessment of quality and short- and long-term outcome.","abstract":"Patients with unfavourable pathology after transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) should be offered completion surgery (CS) if appropriate. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the short-term outcome and long-term oncological results of CS and identify factors compromising the quality of resection specimens.Data were retrieved and analysed on patients who underwent CS from a comprehensive national TEM database (1992-2008) and the institutional prospective database from the Oxford University Hospitals (2008-2011).There were 36 patients eligible for analysis. Postoperative complications occurred in 19 and were minor (grade I-II) in 13 and major (grade III-V) in six patients. The quality of the resected specimen was graded as good in 23 (64%), moderate in six (16.6%) and poor in seven (19.4%). Full-thickness excision by TEM (P = 0.03), an interval to CS greater than 7 weeks (P = 0.05) and distally located lesions (P = 0.04) were associated with increased risk for an inferior surgical specimen. Overall survival after CS was 91% at 1 year and 83% at 5 years. Patients with a 'good' TME specimen had significantly improved disease-free survival compared with patients with an 'inferior' specimen (100 vs 51%, P = 0.001).Patients having full-thickness TEM excision, distally placed lesions and a long interval (> 7 weeks) to CS were likely to have an inferior TME specimen. The results confirm that CS after TEM does not negatively influence local recurrence and survival, but the reduced disease-free survival in patients with an inferior specimen is of concern.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635913","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.525405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"University of Oxford","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.120224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"University Hospitals of Cleveland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hospitals_of_Cleveland"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Oxford","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Limerick Minor Hurling Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_Minor_Hurling_Championship"}]}
