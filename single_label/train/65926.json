{"id":65926,"title":"Prevalence of renal dysfunction according to the type of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation treatment in patients who attended primary care in Spain.","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of renal dysfunction according to the type of atrial fibrillation (AF) and anticoagulation treatment in patients attended in primary care in Spain. METHODS & PARTICIPANTS: The VAL-FAAP study was a national, descriptive, epidemiological and cross-sectional study that included patients of both sexes, ?18 years of age, with a previous diagnosis of AF by an ECG, attended in a primary-care setting. Renal function was defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the modification of diet in renal disease-4 formula.A total of 3287 patients with atrial fibrillation were included (mean age: 71.9 Â± 10.1 years; 52.3% male). Overall, 31.6% of patients had an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m(2) and 1.6% <30 ml/min/1.73m(2). The proportion of patients with permanent AF increased as the eGFR decreased. Similarly, as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ?75 years (doubled), diabetes mellitus, stroke (doubled), vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex category (CHA2DS2-VASc) increased, chronic kidney disease was more frequent. A third of patients with CHA2DS2-VASc ?2 had moderate renal dysfunction; however, 35.5% of them did not receive anticoagulants (compared with 31.5% of those with CHA2DS2-VASc ?2 and normal renal function).Chronic kidney disease is common in patients with AF, particularly in those patients with permanent AF or CHA2DS2-VASc ?2. Although indicated, 35.5% of patients with AF, a CHA2DS2-VASc ?2 and moderate renal dysfunction did not receive appropriate anticoagulation, despite the high risk of stroke.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762248","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.844011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.639362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.51078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.270543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Posttranslational modification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification"}]}
