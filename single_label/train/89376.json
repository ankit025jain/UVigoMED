{"id":89376,"title":"The effects of a global postural reeducation program on an adolescent handball player with isthmic spondylolisthesis.","abstract":"This report describes and evaluates a physical therapy intervention in a 15-year-old male handball player with low grade isthmic spondylolisthesis and associated spinopelvic misalignment (shear-stress type). Upon examination, increased lumbar lordosis, horizontal sacrum and anterior pelvic tilting were mainly associated with altered resting length and extensibility of the iliopsoas, hip adductors and erector spinae muscles. The intervention was directed at improving the muscles resting length and extensibility balance within a global postural alignment perspective (global postural reeducation). After the treatment period, lumbar lordosis, sacral slope and anterior pelvic tilting decreased 17.2°, 16.5° and 15.1° respectively. Global postural reeducation was effective in changing spinopelvic alignment related to low grade isthmic spondylolisthesis. This treatment option should be considered as a potential nonsurgical alternative for this condition.
