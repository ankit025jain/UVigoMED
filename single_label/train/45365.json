{"id":45365,"title":"Can percutaneous cholecystostomy be a definitive management for acute cholecystitis in high-risk patients?","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy, long-term outcome, and safety of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) in high-risk surgical patients.This was a retrospective descriptive review of the medical records of 36 patients who underwent PC for acute cholecystitis (AC) at a single institution between 2000 and 2011. Primary outcomes were overall morbidity, mortality, and need for interval cholecystectomy.PC was initially successful, and symptoms disappeared within 3 days in all patients. Seven patients (2 during hospitalization and 5 during follow-up) died, 6 for a reason unrelated to AC, and 1 succumbed to a sepsis-related condition caused by uncontrolled cholecystitis progression. Elective cholecystectomy was performed in 6 patients. PC was a definitive treatment in 63.9% of patients.PC is a safe and efficient treatment option for patients with AC who are less eligible for surgery. After patients recover from PC, further treatment such as cholecystectomy may not be needed.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686358","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.538372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.262294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Cholecystostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystostomy"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Alternating current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"Seven Network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
