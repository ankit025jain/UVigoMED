{"id":76924,"title":"Arabidopsis AtHB7 and AtHB12 evolved divergently to fine tune processes associated with growth and responses to water stress.","abstract":"Arabidopsis AtHB7 and AtHB12 transcription factors (TFs) belong to the homeodomain-leucine zipper subfamily I (HD-Zip I) and present 62% amino acid identity. These TFs have been associated with the control of plant development and abiotic stress responses; however, at present it is not completely understood how AtHB7 and AtHB12 regulate these processes.By using different expression analysis approaches, we found that AtHB12 is expressed at higher levels during early Arabidopsis thaliana development whereas AtHB7 during later developmental stages. Moreover, by analysing gene expression in single and double Arabidopsis mutants and in transgenic plants ectopically expressing these TFs, we discovered a complex mechanism dependent on the plant developmental stage and in which AtHB7 and AtHB12 affect the expression of each other. Phenotypic analysis of transgenic plants revealed that AtHB12 induces root elongation and leaf development in young plants under standard growth conditions, and seed production in water-stressed plants. In contrast, AtHB7 promotes leaf development, chlorophyll levels and photosynthesis and reduces stomatal conductance in mature plants. Moreover AtHB7 delays senescence processes in standard growth conditions.We demonstrate that AtHB7 and AtHB12 have overlapping yet specific roles in several processes related to development and water stress responses. The analysis of mutant and transgenic plants indicated that the expression of AtHB7 and AtHB12 is regulated in a coordinated manner, depending on the plant developmental stage and the environmental conditions. The results suggested that AtHB7 and AtHB12 evolved divergently to fine tune processes associated with development and responses to mild water stress.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884528","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorophyll","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Arabidopsis thaliana","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana"},{"name":"Photosynthesis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Abiotic component","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic_component"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Genetically modified plant","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_plant"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.665804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.615152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.544226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.537583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.371948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Plant development","weight":0.239576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_development"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Water stress","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stress"},{"name":"Abiotic stress","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic_stress"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
