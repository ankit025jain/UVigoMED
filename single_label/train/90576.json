{"id":90576,"title":"Popliteomeniscal fascicle tears.","abstract":"Isolated popliteomeniscal fascicle tears are often unrecognized and misdiagnosed. Patients typically have vague symptoms and often-normal magnetic resonance imaging and physical examination findings. Isolated injuries are often misdiagnosed and mistreated, leading to delayed surgical treatment. Unrecognized tears can lead to continued disability, lateral meniscus tears, and chondral lesions. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment with inside-out lateral meniscus repair will allow the athlete to return to activity.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598022","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.762962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.753905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.56142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.127125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lateral meniscus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_meniscus"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"}]}
