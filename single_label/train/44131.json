{"id":44131,"title":"Ampullary intervention for bile duct stones in patients with surgically altered anatomy.","abstract":"Transpapillary endoscopic treatment is a standard technique for the treatment of bile duct stones. This technique includes biliary cannulation, ampullary interventions such as endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD), and stone removal. In patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis, the transpapillary approach using an ordinary scope has been challenging. A recently developed single-/double-balloon enteroscope enables therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to be carried out in such cases. EST using a balloon enteroscope is often difficult to carry out as a result of restriction of scope maneuverability or inadequate direction of the accessory. Although EPBD is easy to carry out for any anatomy, large or multiple stones are difficult to remove by EPBD only because of insufficient opening of Vater's papilla. Endoscopic papillary large-balloon dilation following EST is reported to be useful for the treatment of large and/or multiple stones. This technique is also useful for the treatment of bile duct stones in patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis.
