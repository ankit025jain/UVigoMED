{"id":19954,"title":"Severe systemic candidiasis following immunomodulation therapy in in vitro fertilisation-embryo transfer (IVF-ET).","abstract":"A 41-year-old nulliparous woman, with a medical history of unexplained infertility and multiple in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles with immunosuppressive therapy, was admitted to our tertiary obstetrics unit with sepsis at 18 weeks of pregnancy with dichorionic diamniotic twins. Candida glabrata was grown from her blood cultures, then subsequently from the liquor and placentae. She was treated with intravenous ambisome (amphotericin), but unfortunately, the infection resulted in the rupture of her membranes, preterm labour and the demise of her twins. She delivered both twins at 23 weeks, 3 days apart. The antifungal agent was changed to high-dose fluconazole after delivery for 2 weeks and she is now well. Women undergoing IVF-embryo transfer with immunomodulation therapy have a potential risk of developing candidal chorioamnionitis and sepsis.
