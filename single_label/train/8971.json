{"id":8971,"title":"Epidermal RelA specifically restricts contact allergen-induced inflammation and apoptosis in skin.","abstract":"Strong inhibition of NF-?B signaling in the epidermis results in spontaneous skin inflammation in mice and men. As there is evidence for linkage between polymorphisms within the NF-?B signaling pathway and human inflammatory skin phenotypes, we asked whether partial functional inhibition of NF-?B signaling in epidermal keratinocytes can modulate clinically relevant skin inflammation. We therefore mutated rela specifically in the epidermis of mice (RelA(E-MUT) mice). These mice show no inflammatory phenotype. Induction of contact allergy, but not croton oil-induced irritant dermatitis, resulted in stronger ear swelling and increased epidermal thickness in RelA(E-MUT) mice. Both contact allergen and croton oil treatment led to increased expression of calgranulins A and B (S100A8/A9) in RelA(E-MUT) mice. Epidermal hyperproliferation in RelA(E-MUT) mice was non-cell autonomous as cultured primary epidermal keratinocytes from RelA(E-MUT) mice showed reduced proliferation compared with controls. These results demonstrate that epidermal RelA specifically regulates delayed-type hypersensitivity-induced skin inflammation. In addition, we describe here an essential but nonspecific function of RelA in the protection of epidermal keratinocytes from apoptosis. Our study identifies functions of NF-?B signaling in the epidermis and corroborates a specific role of epidermal keratinocytes in the regulation of skin inflammation.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739902","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.560135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.539073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.165452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.157057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Croton oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croton_oil"},{"name":"S100 calcium binding protein A8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S100_calcium_binding_protein_A8"},{"name":"Boston-area streetcar lines","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston-area_streetcar_lines"},{"name":"Croton (plant)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croton_(plant)"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"National Film Board of Canada","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"}]}
