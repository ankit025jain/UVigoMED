{"id":90753,"title":"Leveraging the plate: reliably restoring volar tilt of distal radius fractures.","abstract":"Restoration of volar tilt is critical when performing open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures. A reproducible technique is required to consistently achieve this goal. A simple technique using the locking plate and an electrocautery scratch pad as reduction tools can reliably generate volar tilt. This technique can be performed with minimal aid from surgical assistants.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579208","annotations":[{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.387275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Cauterization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0169476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Axial tilt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Restoration (England)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_(England)"},{"name":"Leverage (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
