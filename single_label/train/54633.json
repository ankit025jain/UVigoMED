{"id":54633,"title":"A historical survey of books on myopia.","abstract":"This paper describes books with content solely on myopia or with titles that imply that they were entirely on myopia. Thirty such books were found, published from 1912 to 2010. For the purpose of organization, they are classified as textbooks, treatises on treatment, treatises on etiology, and conference proceedings. Changing contents of the books through the years reflect increasing sophistication of myopia research and clinical care.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272865","annotations":[{"name":"History","weight":0.633153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Book","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.441581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Textbook","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Proceedings","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings"},{"name":"Treatise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise"},{"name":"Academic conference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
