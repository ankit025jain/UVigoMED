{"id":45573,"title":"SPARC expression is negatively correlated with clinicopathological factors of gastric cancer and inhibits malignancy of gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a glycoprotein which plays multiple roles in different types of cancer. Our previous study showed that SPARC overexpression inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of tumors, and reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the relationship between SPARC expression and clinicopathological factors of gastric cancer (GC) is controversial, and the role of SPARC in GC remains unclear. We evaluated expression of SPARC in 65 human GC tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results indicated that SPARC expression was negatively correlated with clinicopathological factors of GC. In vitro assay showed that SPARC overexpression decreased proliferation and clonogenicity by suppressing CD44 expression. In addition, SPARC overexpression inhibited VEGF induced proliferation and arrested cell cycle of GC cells by reducing the activation of VEGFR2, ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways. SPARC suppressed the invasion and migration of GC by reducing MMP-7, MMP-9, N-cadherin, Sp1 and p-ERK1/2 expression. In the in vivo assay, cancer metastasis mouse models were established by tail vein injection. The results revealed that the lung metastases of SPARC-overexpressing GC cells in the mice were much fewer than those of control cells.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System
