{"id":52462,"title":"Selective case study describing the use of Apligraf on necrobiosis lipoidica associated with diabetes.","abstract":"Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare skin disease characterised by large, well-demarcated, symmetrical plaques with overlying telangiectasias and atrophic, fibrotic features. The disease is associated with diabetes mellitus (1 in 300 cases), but can also be linked to other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Women are three times more likely to develop necrobiosis lipoidica compared to men. Ulcerations are the most serious type of complications in necrobiosis lipoidica, and they occur most frequently on the legs of patients. However, the aetiology of necrobiosis lipoidica still remains unclear. Although many studies have been conducted in order to determine necrobiosis lipoidica's pathophysiology, a clear and definite path to disease has not been recorded. In this case study, a patient with necrobiosis lipoidica that had been refractory to conventional therapy received treatment with ApligrafÂ® bioengineered wound dressings. Apligraf was shown to be effective in managing the patient's multiple hard-to-heal wounds. It was more successful than previous therapies in achieving granulation tissue formation and wound volume reduction, in addition to being a more rapid form of treatment.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600755","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.711032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.598141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.295147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"},{"name":"Biological engineering","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Necrobiosis lipoidica","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrobiosis_lipoidica"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Attachment therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_therapy"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"}]}
