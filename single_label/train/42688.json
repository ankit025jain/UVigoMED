{"id":42688,"title":"A novel multiplex-protein array for serum diagnostics of colorectal cancer: impact of pre-analytical storage conditions.","abstract":"Biomarker discovery studies seldom report on pre-analytical effects. We used a novel multiplex protein biochip for colorectal cancer screening to investigate effects of different storage temperatures and repeated freeze-thaw cycles.This biochip, composed of CEA, IL-8, VEGF, M-CSF, S100A11, C3adesArg, CD26, and CRP, was applied to twenty highly standardized preserved serum samples.Aliquot comparison of long-term storage at -80°C (n=20) versus -170°C (n=20) did not show significant differences for any of the eight markers. In contrast, three freeze-thaw cycles (3 × 20 aliquots) detected changes in the serum level for all markers (p<0.05) but S100A11 and CD26: levels of CEA, IL-8, C3adesArg, and CRP increased, while VEGF and M-CSF levels decreased. However, applying diagnostic thresholds for CEA, IL-8, and CRP revealed that freeze-thaw cycles did not affect diagnostic performance. In contrast, analysis of samples stored at -80°C compared to -170°C failed to detect one out of three detectable malignancies.We conclude that three freeze-thaw cycles modulated serum marker levels significantly, but do not compromise biochip diagnostic performance. For our marker panel, serum preservation at -80°C seems comparable to -170°C; however, storage at -80°C could lead to misdiagnosis. Our findings emphasize the need for standardized sample collection, processing, storage, and reporting.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835368","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.881188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.795711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.716311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.604701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.306653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Room temperature","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Biochip","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochip"},{"name":"Biomarker discovery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_discovery"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4"},{"name":"Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Scholarship_Foundation"},{"name":"S100A11","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S100A11"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Boston-area streetcar lines","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston-area_streetcar_lines"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Storage of wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_of_wine"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"A11 road (England)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A11_road_(England)"}]}
