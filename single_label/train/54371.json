{"id":54371,"title":"Anti-diabetic effect of a novel N-Trisaccharide isolated from Cucumis prophetarum on streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type 2 diabetic rats.","abstract":"Cucumis prophetarum (L.) is used in traditional Indian medicine for the treatment of inflammation related problems.The present investigation was designed to study the effect of N-Trisaccharide (a new compound isolated from the fruit of C. prophetarum (L.)) on hyperglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-nicotinamide (NA) induced type 2 diabetic rats.Different doses of N-Trisaccharide (25 and 50 mg/kgb.w.) were administered once daily for 28 days to STZ-NA induced diabetic rats. Plasma insulin and glycogen levels were measured. The activities of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase were measured. Further, histological studies on pancreas were also carried out.The active compound at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kgb.w. given orally for 14 days showed 47.7% and 69.3% antihyperglycemic activity, respectively. Treatment at the same doses for 28 days provided complete protection against STZ-NA challenge (65 and 230 mg/kgb.w., respectively), intraperitoneally. N-Trisaccharide significantly (p?0.05) increased the plasma insulin and liver glycogen levels in diabetic rats. The altered enzyme activities of carbohydrate metabolism in the liver and kidney of the diabetic rats were significantly (p?0.05) improved. Additionally, N-Trisaccharide increased glycogen synthase and decreased glycogen phosphorylase activity in diabetic rats. Histological studies confirmed an increase in insulin level is due to stimulation of injured pancreatic ?-cells.The results of the study suggested that N-Trisaccharide possesses propitious effect on STZ-NA induced type 2 diabetes, indicating its usefulness in diabetes management.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462215","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Glycogen phosphorylase","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_phosphorylase"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.849748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Glycogen synthase","weight":0.82913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_synthase"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Fructose","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hexokinase","weight":0.808201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexokinase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.700237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.696827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.561715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.55487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Ayurveda","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda"},{"name":"Phosphorylase","weight":0.275373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylase"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"}]}
