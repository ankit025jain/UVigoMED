{"id":43857,"title":"Profile of colorectal polyps: a retrospective study from King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia.","abstract":"To evaluate the predominant colorectal polyps in the Almadinah region of Saudi Arabia.In this iretrospective study, we analyzed pathology reports of colonoscopies performed in King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia during the period 2006 to 2013. Data based on patient age, gender, size, site and type of polyps and the degree of dysplasia were analyzed by software SPSS 17 and compared with other published studies from different geographic regions of the world.During these years, 224 patients had colonic polyps, of whom 149 (66.5%) were men and 75 (33.5%) were women. The most common types of polyps were adenomatous (166), followed by hyperplastic polyps (24), juvenile (18), inflammatory (13), lipomatous (2) and one patient with Peutz-Jegher polyps. Tubulovillous adenoma was the commonest adenomatous polyp (102), followed by tubular (41) and villous (23) types. The sigmoid colon was the most commonly involved region (36.6%). Dysplasia was significantly associated with female patients who had large size tubulovillous polyps located in the left colon.The type and distribution of colorectal polyps in Saudi Arabia is very similar to Western countries. Patient gender, and size, histological type and location of polyps are closely related to dysplastic change in colonic polyps.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761882","annotations":[{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.784812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.65048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.569486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intestinal villus","weight":0.453168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villus"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.361966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fahd of Saudi Arabia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
