{"id":67875,"title":"Representation learning: a unified deep learning framework for automatic prostate MR segmentation.","abstract":"Image representation plays an important role in medical image analysis. The key to the success of different medical image analysis algorithms is heavily dependent on how we represent the input data, namely features used to characterize the input image. In the literature, feature engineering remains as an active research topic, and many novel hand-crafted features are designed such as Haar wavelet, histogram of oriented gradient, and local binary patterns. However, such features are not designed with the guidance of the underlying dataset at hand. To this end, we argue that the most effective features should be designed in a learning based manner, namely representation learning, which can be adapted to different patient datasets at hand. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, a stacked independent subspace analysis (ISA) network is adopted to learn the most effective features in a hierarchical and unsupervised manner. The learnt features are adapted to the dataset at hand and encode high level semantic anatomical information. The proposed method is evaluated on the application of automatic prostate MR segmentation. Experimental results show that significant segmentation accuracy improvement can be achieved by the proposed deep learning method compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital
