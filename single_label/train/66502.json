{"id":66502,"title":"High patient satisfaction of inflatable penile prosthesis insertion with synchronous penile plication for erectile dysfunction and Peyronie's disease.","abstract":"Twenty to thirty percent of patients with Peyronie's disease (PD) have erectile dysfunction (ED) refractory to medical therapy and may benefit from a combined procedure addressing both conditions.The aim of this study was to show the efficacy of inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) insertion and synchronous penile plication for correcting penile curvature and ED in patients with PD.A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent IPP insertion with synchronous penile plication at our tertiary care center between 2010 and 2013. All patients received an intraoperative saline intracorporal injection to induce an artificial erection. After the tunica albuginea was exposed via a standard transverse scrotal incision over the proximal penile shaft, the incision was retracted distally and/or laterally as needed for plication suture placement. Plication sutures were placed in parallel opposite the angle of greatest curvature. The incision was returned proximally to the standard penoscrotal junction for IPP insertion. Demographic and surgical data were collected from the patients' medical records. Patient satisfaction was assessed postoperatively using a nonvalidated questionnaire.The focus of this study was surgical outcomes, both technical and patient-reported satisfaction.Eighteen patients with a mean age of 63 years underwent IPP insertion with synchronous penile plication. Patients presented with dorsal (n?=?11), lateral (n?=?2), and biplanar curvature (n?=?5). Mean preoperative curvature was 39 degrees (range 30-60) and was corrected on average to <5 degrees (range <5-12) using a median of four plication sutures (range 3-6). Among 15 patients completing a postoperative satisfaction survey at a mean of 11 months, all reported improvement in their overall condition and penile curvature; one with biplanar deformity reported minor residual curvature. None reported continued pain or required suture release.IPP insertion with synchronous penile plication for the correction of ED and PD is effective and results in high patient satisfaction.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708140","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.85226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.640667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Peyronie's disease","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyronie's_disease"},{"name":"Penile prosthesis","weight":0.466152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_prosthesis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.346884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.32596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.312277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.225154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.123606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tunica albuginea (penis)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_albuginea_(penis)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
