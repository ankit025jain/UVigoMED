{"id":67371,"title":"Epidemiology of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 infections in southwestern Finland during a 10-year period (2003-2012).","abstract":"The objective of this study was to analyze the proportion of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) in genital infections during a 10-year period (2003-2012) among outpatients of a clinic of sexually transmitted disease in Southwestern Finland.We analyzed prospectively the proportion of HSV-1- or HSV-2-positive culture samples from our sexually transmitted disease clinic outpatients with genital herpes infection during the years 2003 to 2012 and compared the proportions of positive HSV-1 and HSV-2 findings with the age and sex of the patients.Herpes simplex virus type 2 was typed in 66.4% (557/839) and HSV-1 in 33.6% (282/839) of the patients during the entire study period. The mean age of male patients (26.3 years) with a laboratory-confirmed HSV-1 infection was significantly lower than that in male patients with an HSV-2 infection in 2003 to 2007 (26.3 vs. 32.9 years), with P < 0.0001, and (28.6 vs. 34.0) P < 0.0019 in 2008 to 2012, respectively. More female than male patients had HSV-1 infection; in the first study period (2003-2007), 58% were female, and in 2008 to 2012, it was again 63.6%. There was no significant difference between the age of female patients with HSV-1 and those with HSV-2.Herpes simplex virus type 2 was still the most common causative agent of genital herpes in Southwestern Finland, but the proportion of HSV-1 was increasingly high. The age difference between male patients with HSV-1 and HSV-2 narrowed during the years studied.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622640","annotations":[{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.828729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Herpes genitalis","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_genitalis"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.473675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.445936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.329769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.290941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"}]}
