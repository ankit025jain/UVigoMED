{"id":56585,"title":"Interaction of tubby-like protein-1 (Tulp1) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A and MAP1B in the mouse retina.","abstract":"Tubby-like protein-1 (Tulp1) is a photoreceptor-specific protein involved in the transport of specific proteins from the inner segment (IS) to the outer segment (OS) in photoreceptor cells. Mutations in the human TULP1 gene cause an early onset form of retinitis pigmentosa. Our previous work has shown an association between Tulp1 and the microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B. An allele of Mtap1a, which encodes the MAP1A protein, significantly delays photoreceptor degeneration in Tulp1 mutant mice. MAP1 proteins are important in stabilizing microtubules in neuronal cells, but their role in photoreceptors remains obscure. To investigate the relationship between Tulp1 and MAP1 proteins, we performed western blots, immunoprecipitations (IP), immunohistochemistry and proximity ligand assays (PLA) in wild-type and tulp1-/- mouse retinas. Our IP experiments provide evidence that Tulp1 and MAP1B interact while PLA experiments localize their interaction to the outer nuclear layer and IS of photoreceptors. Although MAP1A and MAP1B protein levels are not affected in the tulp1-/- retina, they are no longer localized to the OS of photoreceptors. This may be the cause for disorganized OSs in tulp1-/- mice, and indicate that their transport to the OS is Tulp1-dependent.
