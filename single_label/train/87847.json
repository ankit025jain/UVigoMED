{"id":87847,"title":"[Bone metabolism and cardiovascular function update. Estrogen and its therapeutic potential for bone and vascular health].","abstract":"Despite its long-standing role as a \"guardian angel\" for the female body, estrogen has recently been dethroned from its status as an \"elixir\" and its use has been restricted due to its oncogenic potential as well as its coagulation system-associated risk. However, it is recognized that estrogen not only works against bone resorption but also improves vascular function. In this regard, it is suggested that estrogen may have a role in improving deteriorated bone quality through its antioxidant action, while this same effect with the SERMs, which may be accounted for by the presence of estrogen, remains yet to be established. Not only evidence needs to be accumulated to support the vascular effects of the SERMs, but their pleiotropic, rather than extra-skeletal, effects, as likely mediated by the estrogen receptors distributed throughout the body, remain to be elucidated.
