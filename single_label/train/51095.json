{"id":51095,"title":"[Diabetes increases short- and long-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)].","abstract":"Long-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in elderly patients with abundant comorbidities is considerable. We aimed to determine the impact of diabetes on short- and long-term mortality after TAVI.Our study includes 300 consecutive patients (mean age, 82 Â± 5 years) who underwent TAVI (158 transapical, 142 transfemoral procedures). All patients were followed by regular telephone contacts. 36% suffered from diabetes.Diabetes could be identified as significant predictor of short- and long-term mortality after TAVI. In diabetic patients, 30-day-mortality was 2,5 fold elevated (18.3% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.004). Furthermore, they were at significantly higher risk of peri-interventional stroke (p = 0.04), stage 3 acute kidney injury (p = 0.003), and prolonged ventilation (p = 0.01). Even after successful TAVI and discharge from hospital, long-term mortality was significantly elevated in diabetic patients (56% vs. 30%, p < 0.0001). Of note, 25% of diabetic vs. only 8% of non-diabetic patients died from cardiac causes during follow-up, suggesting that TAVI is not able to reduce cardiac-related mortality risk in diabetic patients to the same extent as in non-diabetics.Diabetes represents a powerful predictor of adverse early and late outcome after TAVI. These findings should be incorporated into the assessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio of TAVI in diabetic patients.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722931","annotations":[{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.740728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.72565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.699312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.695305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.542891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
