{"id":91980,"title":"Improvement of diagnostic rate of carpal tunnel syndrome with additional median-to-ulnar comparative nerve conduction studies.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess whether additional median -to-ulnar comparative tests will improve the diagnostic rate of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).We recruited 248 hands of 162 CTS patients, and 166 hands of 83 controls. One hundred and sixty-eight (68%) symptomatic hands had abnormal median distal latencies or palm-wrist latencies. We performed three additional comparative tests in the remaining symptomatic hands and the non-CTS hands. The first test compared median distal motor latency (MDL) recorded from the second lumbrical muscle (2L) and ulnar distal latency recorded from interossei muscles (INT) (2L-INT). The second test compared median and ulnar antidromic sensory latencies (MS-US). And the third test compared median and ulnar nerve latencies in the palm-to-wrist segment (PM-PU).In control subjects, upper limits of median-to-ulnar differences were: 2L-INT= 0.4 ms, MS-US= 0.5 ms, PM-PU= 0.4 ms. In CTS patients with normal conventional electrodiagnostic methods, MS-US difference showed the lowest sensitivity (21.3%). The diagnostic sensitivity of 2L-INT was 27.5% and PM-PU 47.5%. With PM-PU test, additional 15.3% diagnostic rate could be got.For CTS patients with normal results from the standard methods, PM-PU is a good additional comparative test to further improve diagnostic rate.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458852","annotations":[{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Nerve conduction study","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.754011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.559022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.192716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Interossei","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interossei"},{"name":"Lumbricals of the hand","weight":0.140833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbricals_of_the_hand"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.113767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0815175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Antidromic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidromic"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Reference ranges for blood tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"2009 North Korean nuclear test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_North_Korean_nuclear_test"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"2L","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2L"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Alstom Coradia LINT","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alstom_Coradia_LINT"},{"name":"West Indian cricket team in England in 2007","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_England_in_2007"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
