{"id":60831,"title":"Genotyping increases the yield of angiotensin-converting enzyme in sarcoidosis--a systematic review.","abstract":"The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is challenging and involves radiological, clinical and paraclinical evaluation, the latter including the measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (s-ACE), which is elevated in about 60% of sarcoidosis patients. The normal inter-individual biological variation of s-ACE is large. Approximately 50% of the variation is due to a genomic insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene.We searched the MEDLINE library for articles presenting genotype-based reference intervals for s-ACE in healthy people. We summarised the results as weighted mean DD/II ratios of s-ACE. We also summarised the presented frequencies of the genotypes.We identified nine studies presenting genotype-based reference intervals. All studies found a significant difference between mean s-ACE in the three genotype groups DD, ID and II. The mean DD/II ratio was 1.85 (range: 1.79-1.92) for all studies, 2.01 (1.92-2.10) for Caucasians and 1.64 (1.55-1.73) for Asians. The median frequencies of genotypes among Caucasians were 23% II, 45% ID and 30% DD, and 45% II, 49% ID and 14% DD among Asians.Genotyping for the I/D polymorphism increases the benefit of s-ACE since all studies found significantly different levels between genotype groups in healthy subjects. Genotyping is of special value if s-ACE is between the upper 97.5 percentile for genotype II and DD since values in this interval are at risk of being misclassified. Due to assay variation, genotype-specific reference levels should be verified locally.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814734","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.893697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.694301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.54862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.508151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.338585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.126817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"791","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/791"},{"name":"922","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/922"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Doctor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Unclassified language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclassified_language"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
