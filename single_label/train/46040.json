{"id":46040,"title":"Attachment, childhood abuse, and IBD-related quality of life and disease activity outcomes.","abstract":"This study examined attachment style as a moderator of the relationship between childhood abuse and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related outcomes.Study participants were 205 patients with IBD from Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Participants completed self-report questionnaires regarding personal relationships, abuse history, and IBD-related information. Multiple regression models were fit using 3 outcome variables: disease-related quality of life (QOL), disease activity for ulcerative colitis, and disease activity for Crohn's disease.Patients reporting less severe abuse and low levels of avoidant attachment had the highest levels of QOL, whereas patients reporting high levels of avoidant attachment had the lowest levels of QOL, regardless of abuse severity. Patients reporting greater anxious attachment had lower QOL scores. Patients reporting less severe abuse and low levels of avoidant attachment had the lowest levels of disease activity, whereas patients reporting high levels of avoidant attachment had the highest levels of ulcerative colitis-related disease activity, regardless of abuse severity. However, for anxious attachment, there was no significant main effect or significant interaction of abuse by anxious attachment on ulcerative colitis-related disease activity. Childhood abuse and attachment style were not found to be associated with Crohn's disease-related disease activity.Adult attachment style may moderate the relationship between childhood abuse and IBD-related outcomes, by impacting one's QOL and disease activity. Distinct types of insecure attachment styles may impact these relationships differently. Psychological interventions focusing on attachment styles of patients with IBD have the potential to improve IBD-related QOL and disease activity.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651585","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.677403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.671519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.600734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.531015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.493994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.418376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.153596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"History","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Toronto","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Mary Ainsworth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ainsworth"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Mount Sinai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai"},{"name":"Mount Sinai Hospital, New York","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai_Hospital,_New_York"},{"name":"Attachment in adults","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Chairman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Main effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_effect"},{"name":"Regression (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_(psychology)"},{"name":"Sinai Hospital","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Hospital"},{"name":"Sinai Peninsula","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"}]}
