{"id":73392,"title":"Congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma of the foot--avoidance of amputation.","abstract":"Congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma is a rare entity with a five year survival rate of over 90%. Surgery is still the most common treatment modality with amputation often necessary. There have been reports supporting the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to debulk the tumour in an effort to facilitate limb sparing surgery. We report a case of a newborn who presented with a life threatening haemorrhage from a fibrosarcoma of the foot, successfully treated with Vincristine, Actinomycin and Cyclophosphamide (VAC) chemotherapy alone.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908860","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Fibrosarcoma","weight":0.821334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosarcoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.787718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Five-year survival rate","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_survival_rate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.618362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.554945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Actinomycin","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinomycin"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.189447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"}]}
