{"id":20914,"title":"Differentiation of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) variants by pyrosequencing.","abstract":"A fast and reliable protocol using the pyrosequencing technique was developed to identify 11 different types of the KPC enzyme. A total of 65 blaKPC positive bacterial isolates were tested and characterized. In the end, the pyrosequencing proved to be a powerful tool for epidemiological studies of KPC producer isolates.
