{"id":87250,"title":"Symptom management during the radiation oncology treatment course: a practical guide for the oncology clinician.","abstract":"Symptom management during radiation therapy is critical to providing high-quality care for patients receiving treatment. Symptoms are varied and dependent on the site irradiated. Common symptoms associated with radiation therapy include dermatitis, xerostomia, mucositis, and pneumonitis. Treatment strategies include prevention, anticipation, and development of clinical practice enabling rapid identification and management of emerging symptoms. Understanding the spectrum of symptomatology affecting irradiated patients is integral to improved quality of life and treatment efficacy.
