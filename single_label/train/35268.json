{"id":35268,"title":"Distribution of IL-31 and its receptor expressing cells in skin of atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"To understand the clinical segments of IL-31 signaling blockade therapy in pruritus of atopic dermatitis (AD), direct detection of the target proteins in the diseased tissues will provide crucial information. There is a lack of direct evidence concerning the cellular origin of IL-31 in AD skins, and data on the expression of IL-31RA in AD are inconsistent. Also, there is no available information regarding IL-31RA protein expression in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which mediates the sensation of itch and is the long-suspected source of the protein.We sought to obtain direct evidence concerning the distribution of IL-31- and IL-31RA-protein expressing cells and their characteristics in AD skin samples and in human DRG.IL-31 was detected immunohistochemically in AD skins, and representative sections were double stained with IL-31 and several immune-markers. IL-31RA was stained immunohistochemically in AD skins and normal human DRG, and representative AD skins were double stained with IL-31RA and PGP9.5 (a nerve marker).IL-31-positive cells were observed as mononuclear infiltrating cells and as CD11b co-expressing cells in severe AD samples. As for IL-31RA, positive reactions were detected in keratinocytes and nerve fibers in the dermis of AD and in the neurons of normal DRG.The detection of IL-31 in infiltrating cells of severe AD skin and of IL-31RA in nerve fibers of AD dermis and normal DRG indicates IL-31 signaling may be a contributing factor in the persistence and exacerbation of AD skin lesions.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
