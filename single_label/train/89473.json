{"id":89473,"title":"[Characteristics of trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a general hospital in Chile].","abstract":"Trauma is an important cause of death among young adults.To determine the characteristics, treatments and evolution of trauma patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a public hospital in Santiago, Chile.All polytrauma (PT) and severely traumatized (ST) patients admitted to ICU were included. We recorded the type of trauma along with demographic and hemodynamic variables, treatments and complications. The evolution and treatments received by PT and ST patients were compared.We recorded data from 72 patients aged 43 Â± 21 years (93% males). Sixty two percent were PT and 24% had penetrating injuries. TBI (Trauma Brain Injury) was the most common trauma. On admission, acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was 18.7 + 7.3, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 32.8 + 20.1. ICU stay was 7.8 + 6 days. Sixty seven per cent of patients required surgery and 58% received blood transfusions. No differences were found between PT and ST. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 15 and 25% respectively.The characteristics and evolution of PT and ST of this series of patients are similar to those described abroad. Mortality was in agreement with ISS and APACHE II scores.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718464","annotations":[{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.796501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Penetrating trauma","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrating_trauma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.690256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.685832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.457443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.262651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"APACHE II","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APACHE_II"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Public hospital","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_hospital"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Santiago","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
