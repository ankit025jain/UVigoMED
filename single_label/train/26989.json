{"id":26989,"title":"[The dynamics and prognostic value of cerebral natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein under acute cardiac infarction depending on tactic of treatment].","abstract":"The sampling consisted of 102 patients with acute cardiac infarction with ST elevation up to 6 hours from the onset of disease. The subjects were divided into three groups: group I with primary stent procedure, group II with deferred stent procedure during 24 hours after effective thrombolytic therapy and group III with isolated effective thrombolytic therapy. The Doppler-echocardiography was applied to all patients. In every group the evaluation was carried out to dynamics NT-proBNP and C-reactive protein. In group III with isolated effective thrombolytic therapy in sub-acute period of cardiac infarction NT-proBNP increased more than twice in comparison with groups of patients with stent procedure. The values of C-reactive protein were lower than in groups I and II. The dynamics of NT-proBNP and C-reactive protein depend on mode of regeneration of coronary blood flow and level of increase of NT-proBNP corresponds the type of diastolic dysfunction of left ventricle of heart.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069229","annotations":[{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.821325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.588503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.498665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diastolic heart failure","weight":0.493682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastolic_heart_failure"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0471911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"ST elevation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST_elevation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Natriuretic peptide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
