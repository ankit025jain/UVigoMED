{"id":19948,"title":"Association between Mycoplasma genitalium infection and HIV acquisition among female sex workers in Uganda: evidence from a nested case-control study.","abstract":"Cross-sectional studies have shown a strong association between Mycoplasma genitalium and HIV infections. We previously reported that in a cohort of female sex workers in Uganda, M genitalium infection at baseline was associated with HIV seroconversion. Here we examine the temporal association between the M genitalium infection status shortly before HIV seroconversion and HIV acquisition.A nested case-control study was conducted within a cohort of women at high risk for HIV in Kampala. Cases were those of women acquiring HIV within 2 years of enrolment. For each of the 42 cases, 3 controls were selected from women HIV negative at the visit when the corresponding case first tested HIV seropositive. The association between HIV acquisition and M genitalium infection immediately prior to HIV testing was analysed using conditional logistic regression.There was weak evidence of an association between M genitalium infection and HIV acquisition overall (crude OR=1.57; 95% CI 0.67 to 3.72, aOR=2.28: 95% CI 0.81 to 6.47). However, time of M genitalium testing affected the association (p value for effect-modification=0.004). For 29 case-control sets with endocervical samples tested 3 months prior to the first HIV-positive result, M genitalium infection increased the risk of HIV acquisition (crude OR=3.09; 95% CI 1.06 to 9.05, aOR=7.19; 95% CI 1.68 to 30.77), whereas there was little evidence of an association among the 13 case-control sets with samples tested at an earlier visit (crude OR=0.30: 95% CI 0.04 to 2.51; aOR=0.34; 95% CI 0.02 to 5.94).Our study showed evidence of a temporal relationship between M genitalium infection and HIV acquisition that suggests that M genitalium infection may be a co-factor in the acquisition of HIV infection.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687129","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.811419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Prostitution","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.501932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.376707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.280063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Sex worker","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.188301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Mycoplasma genitalium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_genitalium"},{"name":"Kampala","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampala"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"}]}
