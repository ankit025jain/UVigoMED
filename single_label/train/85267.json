{"id":85267,"title":"[Effects of the water channel aquaporin 4 deficiency on bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice.In wild type and AQP4 gene knockout (AQP4-/-) mice, lung fibrosis was induced by injection of bleomycin (3 mg/kg) into the trachea and saline injection was used as a control. At d3, 7, 14, 28 after bleomycin-treatment, mice were randomly sacrificed in batch and the lung coefficient was determined. Serum levels of TGF-?1 and TNF-? were measured by ELISA and hydroxyproline contents in lung tissue were determined by Alkaline hydrolysis method. H-E staining and Masson's staining were performed to examine the pathological changes of lung tissues after bleomycin-treatment.On d14 after bleomycin-treatment, the lung coefficients in wild type mice and AQP4-/- mice were 1.9-fold (12.69 ± 6.05 vs 6.80 ± 0.82, q=4.204, P<0.05) and 2.3-fold (14.05 ± 5.82 vs 6.05± 0.58, q=5.172, P<0.01) of that in control, respectively, but no significant difference was found between wild type and AQP4-/- mice in the lung coefficient value (P>0.05). The hydroxyproline contents in the lung increased after bleomycin-treatment; on d28, the lung hydroxyproline contents in wild type and in AQP4-/- mice were 1.55-fold (0.85 ± 0.22 g/mg vs 0.55 ± 0.14 ?g/mg, q=4.313, P<0.05) and 1.4-fold (0.84 ± 0.13 ?g/mg vs 0.60 ± 0.14?g/mg, q=4.595?P<0.05) of that in control, respectively, but no significant difference was noticed between wild type and AQP4-/- mice in lung hydroxyproline contents. There was a tendency that serum TGF-?1 and TNF-? levels increased in bleomycin-treated mice, but no significant difference was found between wild type and AQP4-/- mice. AQP4-knockout showed no effects on pathological changes of lung tissues with H-E staining and Masson's staining in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.AQP4 might not be involved in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998650","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.84042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.801116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.556894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.549488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.544887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.463176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Hydroxyproline","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyproline"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.366389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.338112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.331433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.311627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Aquaporin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin"},{"name":"Aquaporin 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin_4"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
