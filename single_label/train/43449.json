{"id":43449,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of dual-echo (in- and opposed-phase) T1-weighted gradient recalled echo for detection and grading of hepatic iron using quantitative and visual assessment.","abstract":"Detection and quantification of hepatic iron with dual-echo gradient recalled echo (GRE) has been proposed as a rapid alternative to other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Co-existing steatosis and T1 weighting are limitations. This study assesses the accuracy of routine dual-echo GRE.Between 2010 and 2013, 109 consecutive patients underwent multi-echo (ME) MRI and dual-echo GRE for quantification of hepatic iron. Liver iron concentration (LIC) was calculated from ME-MRI. Relative signal intensity (RSI) and fat signal fraction (FSF) were calculated from dual-echo GRE. Four radiologists subjectively evaluated dual-echo GRE (±subtraction). Diagnostic accuracy was compared between techniques and correlated with biopsy using Fisher's exact test, Spearman correlation and regression.The sensitivity of visual detection of iron ranged from 48 to 55%. Subtraction did not increase sensitivity (p?<?0.001). Inter-observer variability was substantial (??=?0.72). The specificity of visual detection of iron approached 100% with false-positive diagnoses observed using subtraction. LIC showed a higher correlation with histopathological iron grade (r?=?0.94, p?<?0.001) compared with RSI (r?=?0.65, p?=?0.02). Univariate regression showed an association between RSI and LIC (B?=?0.98, p?<?0.001, CI 0.73-1.23); however, the association was not significant with multi-variate regression including FSF (p?=?0.28).Dual-echo GRE has low sensitivity for hepatic iron. Subtraction imaging can result in false-positive diagnoses.• Routine liver MRI studies cannot effectively screen patients for iron overload. • Concomitant hepatic steatosis and iron limits diagnostic accuracy of routine liver MRI. • Dual-echo GRE subtraction imaging causes false-positive diagnoses of iron overload. • Dedicated MRI techniques should be used to diagnose and quantify iron overload.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788037","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance
