{"id":61604,"title":"Selenium inadequacy is not associated with oxidative stress in child and adolescent acute lymphocytic leukemia survivors.","abstract":"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and its subsequent treatment may provoke increased oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant status of children and adolescents who had received ALL therapy, and to test the hypothesis that selenium (Se) inadequacy is correlated with reduced defenses against oxidative stress in this population.This case-control study involved 24 patients between ages 5 and 13 y who had been treated successfully for ALL (ALL group) and 60 children of similar age and socioeconomic background with no clinical history of leukemia (control group). Dietary intake of Se was evaluated by the 24-h recall method, and the concentrations of Se in plasma, erythrocytes, and urine determined. Antioxidant status was assessed by analysis of the oxidative stress markers, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), ?-tocopherol, and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG).There were no between-group differences with respect to plasma (P = 0.122), erythrocyte (P = 0.202), urinary (P = 0.608), or dietary (P = 0.757) levels of Se. GPx activity was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in the ALL group compared with the control group, whereas SOD activity and MDA concentrations were similar. The concentrations of ?-tocopherol and 8-oxo-dG were significantly increased in the ALL group compared with the control group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.031, respectively).All participants were Se inadequate, but such inadequacy was not correlated with reduced defenses against oxidative stress. However, individuals of the ALL group were with increased oxidative stress compared with the control group, possibly due to previous disease and to intensive polychemotherapy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698347","annotations":[{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.874168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Tocopherol","weight":0.871054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocopherol"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.799083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.747448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.727113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.700897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.470625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.358789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.129335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.109641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"}]}
