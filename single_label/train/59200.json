{"id":59200,"title":"Increased placental neurosteroidogenic gene expression precedes poor outcome in the preterm guinea pig.","abstract":"Placental 5?-reductase (5?R) is influenced by in utero compromises and has a role in regulating neuroactive steroid concentrations in the fetus. The objective of this study was to determine if changes in placental 5?R were associated with neonatal outcome after birth. Guinea pigs were delivered by cesarean section at term (GA69, n=22) or preterm (GA62, n=36) and the placenta collected. Preterm neonates were maintained for 24 h unless their condition deteriorated before this time. Enzyme mRNA expression of 5?R type-1 and 5?R type-2 were determined using real-time PCR. All preterm neonates had significantly higher 5?R2 expression in their placenta compared with placentae from term neonates (P<0.0001). Expression was also markedly higher in the placentae from neonates that did not survive until 24 h, compared with surviving preterm neonates (P=0.04). These findings suggest differences of in utero neurosteroidogenic capacity between surviving and non-surviving preterm guinea pig neonates. The increased 5?R2 mRNA expression in the placenta of non-survivors suggests an induction of the neurosteroid pathway due to prior exposure to an in utero compromise, with such exposure possibly a predisposing factor that contributed to their poor ex utero outcome.
