{"id":79078,"title":"Per-oral flexible laryngoscopy in awake neonates and infants: the 'pacifier' technique.","abstract":"It is common for ENT specialists to be called to neonatal intensive care units to assess neonates with suspected laryngomalacia. At Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, it is standard practice to initially try to assess the larynx whilst the patient is awake. This can cause the patient to cry and become irritable, and can induce worry in the parents. A literature search revealed that numerous procedures have been successfully performed on neonates and infants whilst they were being pacified.This paper describes various procedures where pacification has been used effectively. Furthermore, it reports a pacification technique developed for per-oral flexible laryngoscopy in awake neonates and infants.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495455","annotations":[{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.616108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.473382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.46898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.381468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.338582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cambridge","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Addenbrooke's Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addenbrooke's_Hospital"},{"name":"Laryngomalacia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngomalacia"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Peace","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Try","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Try"},{"name":"Pacifier","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifier"}]}
