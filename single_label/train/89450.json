{"id":89450,"title":"Current concepts in cervical spine trauma.","abstract":"Much has been written about cervical spine trauma. Although occipitocervical dislocations result in high mortality rates at the scene of the injury, more patients are surviving this injury as a result of safety improvements. Injuries to this region of the spine are often undiagnosed, even by experienced spine surgeons and radiologists. Substantial controversy and debate remain surrounding cervical spinal clearance, spinal cord injury, odontoid fractures, traumatic spondylolisthesis of C2 on C3, and subaxial cervical spine facet subluxations and dislocations. Although debate regarding appropriate treatment algorithms for these injuries still exists, management recommendations based on the available evidence will be helpful to the treating surgeon.
