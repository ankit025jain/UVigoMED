{"id":85302,"title":"Update in lung transplantation 2013.","abstract":"Research in pulmonary transplantation is actively evolving in quality and scope to meet the challenges of a growing population of lung allograft recipients. In 2013, research groups leveraged large publicly available datasets in addition to multicenter research networks and single-center studies to make significant contributions to our knowledge and clinical care in the areas of donor use, clinical transplant outcomes, mechanisms of rejection, infectious complications, and chronic allograft dysfunction.
