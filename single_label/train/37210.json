{"id":37210,"title":"Non-operative management of giant omphalocele with topical povidone-iodine and powdered antibiotic combination: early experience from a tertiary centre.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate topical povidone-iodine and topical powdered antibiotic combination (Polymyxin, Bacitracin and Neomycin) in initial non-operative management with delayed closure of the defect of giant omphaloceles.A prospective study was conducted between July 2010 and June 2013 including all neonates with giant omphalocele without signs of intestinal obstruction. All cases were managed by daily application of povidone-iodine (5% solution) followed by spraying topical powdered antibiotic combination to promote eschar formation and eventual epithelialisation. Record was made of sex, associated anomalies, length of stay, and thyroid function tests.Twenty-four neonates with giant omphaloceles were treated with topical povidone-iodine and topical powdered antibiotic combination. No sac ruptures were observed in our series. All patients had a normal thyroid function test at presentation and after 10 days of initiation of treatment. Six patients have undergone delayed repair.Topical povidone-iodine and powdered antibiotic combination promotes more rapid escharification and epithelialisation of the omphalocele than povidone-iodine alone. We also hypothesise that combination minimises the chances of hypothyroidism associated with use of povidone-iodine alone.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509569","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.587597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Neomycin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomycin"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Omphalocele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalocele"},{"name":"Bacitracin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacitracin"},{"name":"Eschar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschar"},{"name":"Thyroid function tests","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_function_tests"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Total chances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_chances"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Polymyxin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxin"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0147534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
