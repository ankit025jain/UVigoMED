{"id":87721,"title":"Prevalence of self-reported shaking and smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4-month-old infants in Japan.","abstract":"Few studies have investigated the prevalence of shaking and smothering and whether they are associated with co-sleeping. In Japan, co-sleeping is common during infancy and early childhood. This study investigates the prevalence of shaking and smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4-month-old infants in Japan. A questionnaire was administered to mothers who participated in a 4-month health checkup program in Kamagaya City in Japan (n = 1307; valid response rate, 82%). The questionnaire investigated the frequency of self-reported shaking and smothering during the past one month, co-sleeping status, and living arrangements with grandparents, in addition to traditional risk factors such as stress due to crying. Associations between co-sleeping and self-reported shaking or smothering were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of self-reported shaking and smothering at least one time during the past one month was 3.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4%-4.3%) and 2.4% (95% CI, 1.5%-3.2%), respectively. Co-sleeping was marginally associated with the amount of crying and not associated with stress due to crying. Further, co-sleeping was not associated with either self-reported shaking or smothering, although stress due to crying showed strong association with shaking and smothering. Co-sleeping was not a risk factor for shaking and smothering.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003171","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.804534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.417087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.233668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Crying","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0429744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Kamagaya, Chiba","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamagaya,_Chiba"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"1307","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1307"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"}]}
