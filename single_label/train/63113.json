{"id":63113,"title":"Making self-care a priority for women at risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema.","abstract":"Estimates suggest that between 41% and 94% of breast cancer survivors may develop the chronic condition of secondary lymphedema at some point during their lifetimes. Self-care is critical for effective lymphedema management and risk-reduction. At the same time, women in general have been characterized as engaging in self-sacrificing behaviors in which they choose other-care over self-care. This study explored the self-care experiences of women with breast cancer within the contexts of complex and demanding familial and work-related responsibilities. Participants (N=14) were enrolled in a behavioral-educational intervention aimed at lymphedema risk-reduction. This feminist family theory-informed secondary analysis of qualitative data focused on women's familial roles and the balance or lack of balance between self-sacrifice and self-care. Findings included participants' struggles with time management and prioritizing self-care over care of others as well as making a commitment to self-care. Findings have implications for patient and family-level education and research with regard to gender role-based barriers to self-care and self-care within complex social contexts.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476674","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.691049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.653418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.561919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.52438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Feminism","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.456322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.379197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.328264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Time management","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"N14 road (South Africa)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N14_road_(South_Africa)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Qualitative data","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
