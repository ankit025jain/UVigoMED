{"id":46069,"title":"Chk1, but not Chk2, is responsible for G2/M phase arrest induced by diallyl disulfide in human gastric cancer BGC823 cells.","abstract":"Diallyl disulfide (DADS) has been shown to cause G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in several human cancers. Here we demonstrate a mechanism by which DADS induces G2/M phase arrest in BGC823 human gastric cancer cells via Chk1. From cell cycle gene array results, we next confirmed that cyclin B1 expression was decreased by DADS, while the expression of p21, GADD45? and p53 were increased. Despite the lack of change in Chk1 gene expression in response to DADS according to the array analysis, intriguingly overexpression of Chk1, but not Chk2, exhibited increased accumulation in G2/M phase. Moreover, overexpression of Chk1 promoted the effect of DADS-induced G2/M arrest. Augmented phosphorylation of Chk1 by DADS was observed in Chk1-transfected cells, followed by downregulation of Cdc25C and cyclin B1 proteins. In contrast, phosphorylated Chk2 showed no obvious change in Chk2-transfected cells after DADS treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of Chk1 by siRNA partially abrogated DADS-induced downregulation of Cdc25C and cyclin B1 proteins and G2/M arrest. In contrast, knockdown of Chk2 did not show these effects. Therefore, these data indicate that DADS may specifically modulate Chk1 phosphorylation, and DADS-induced G2/M phase arrest in BGC823 cells could result in part from Chk1-mediated inhibition of the Cdc25C/cyclin B1 pathway.
