{"id":70430,"title":"Effects of iron depletion on CALM-AF10 leukemias.","abstract":"Iron, an essential nutrient for cellular growth and proliferation, enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid (CALM) protein plays an essential role in the cellular import of iron by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CALM-AF10 leukemias harbor a single copy of the normal CALM gene and therefore may be more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of iron restriction compared with normal hematopoietic cells. We found that CALM heterozygous (CALM(HET)) murine fibroblasts exhibit signs of iron deficiency, with increased surface transferrin receptor levels and reduced growth rates. CALM(HET) hematopoietic cells are more sensitive in vitro to iron chelators than their wild type counterparts. Iron chelation also displayed toxicity toward cultured CALM(HET)CALM-AF10 leukemia cells, and this effect was additive to that of chemotherapy. In mice transplanted with CALM(HET)CALM-AF10 leukemia, we found that dietary iron restriction reduced tumor burden in the spleen. However, dietary iron restriction, used alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy, did not increase survival of mice with CALM(HET)CALM-AF10 leukemia. In summary, although CALM heterozygosity results in iron deficiency and increased sensitivity to iron chelation in vitro, our data in mice do not suggest that iron depletion strategies would be beneficial for the therapy of CALM-AF10 leukemia patients.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193880","annotations":[{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.845478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.819406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Chelation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.642859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.640748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.465872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clathrin","weight":0.434897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.356727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.319573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Essential nutrient","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_nutrient"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.175837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Heterozygote","weight":0.114033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Transferrin receptor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_receptor"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Chelation therapy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation_therapy"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"}]}
