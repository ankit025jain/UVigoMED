{"id":88822,"title":"Nonoperative and postoperative rehabilitation for injuries of the throwing shoulder.","abstract":"The repetitive overhead motion involved in throwing is responsible for unique and sport-specific patterns of injury to the shoulder joint. Specific strengthening and flexibility plays a vital role in the ultimate function and injury prevention in the overhead-throwing athlete. The clinician must achieve a delicate balance between mobility and stability, which often presents as a significant challenge. Most shoulder injuries in the overhead thrower can be successfully treated nonoperatively to allow the athlete to return to competition. A well-structured, in-season strengthening program that is designed to maintain the athlete's strength, power, and endurance while not inhibiting with the athlete's ability to compete on a regular basis is critical.
