{"id":55216,"title":"Patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes with laser refractive surgery performed by surgeons in training.","abstract":"To evaluate the refractive error quality of life (RQL) improvement, patient satisfaction, and clinical results of laser refractive surgery performed by residents or fellows.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA.Case series.This study reviewed the clinical results of consecutive refractive surgery cases performed between March 2010 and February 2012 by ophthalmology residents or fellows. One-year postoperative analysis of the RQL and patient satisfaction in a subgroup of patients was completed using the National Eye Institute Refractive Error Correction Quality of Life-42 instrument (NEI RQL-42), and a comparison with NEI published normative data and post-refractive data was performed.Data were obtained from 138 eyes that had laser in situ keratomileusis and 4 eyes that had photorefractive keratectomy. The 1-year postoperative analysis of the RQL and patient satisfaction was completed in 34 patients. After 6 months postoperatively, the mean uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.01 logMAR (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.012 to 0.023). The mean postoperative residual refractive error spherical equivalent was -0.20 diopter (D) (95% CI, -0.26 to -0.13). No eye lost corrected distance visual acuity. Equivalent or better satisfaction in the RQL was found in all but 1 of the 13 scale scores of the NEI RQL-42 compared with previously published NEI data.Laser refractive surgery performed by residents and fellows showed high patient satisfaction and an improved RQL 1-year postoperatively. Clinical outcomes validated the safety and efficacy of refractive surgery performed by surgeons in training.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957433","annotations":[{"name":"Refractive surgery","weight":0.825549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.824471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.632027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.383807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.32343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.295461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.229571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.226912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Wisconsin","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin"},{"name":"National Eye Institute","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eye_Institute"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Error detection and correction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Fellowship (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellowship_(medicine)"},{"name":"Proprietary software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software"},{"name":"Measuring instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"}]}
