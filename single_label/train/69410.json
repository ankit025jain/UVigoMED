{"id":69410,"title":"Vascular calcification in long-term kidney transplantation.","abstract":"Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the long-term.The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting list.The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P?=?0.2). There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was observed in KT recipients (P?=?0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P?=?0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial after 5 years.Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part influenced by past dialysis experience.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447254","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.740669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.624575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.470973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.418153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}]}
