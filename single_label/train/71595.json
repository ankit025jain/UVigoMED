{"id":71595,"title":"Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in diffusion-weighted mr imaging in breast cancer: comparison with single-shot echo-planar imaging in image quality.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the image quality of standard single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI) and that of readout-segmented EPI (rs-EPI) in patients with breast cancer.Seventy-one patients with 74 breast cancers underwent both ss-EPI and rs-EPI. For qualitative comparison of image quality, three readers independently assessed the two sets of diffusion-weighted (DW) images. To evaluate geometric distortion, a comparison was made between lesion lengths derived from contrast enhanced MR (CE-MR) images and those obtained from the corresponding DW images. For assessment of image parameters, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lesion contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated.The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in most criteria regarding the qualitative image quality. Anatomical structure distinction, delineation of the lesion, ghosting artifact, and overall image quality were significantly better in rs-EPI. Regarding the geometric distortion, lesion length on ss-EPI was significantly different from that of CE-MR, whereas there were no significant differences between CE-MR and rs-EPI. The rs-EPI was superior to ss-EPI in SNR and CNR.Readout-segmented EPI is superior to ss-EPI in the aspect of image quality in DW MR imaging of the breast.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25053898","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.706934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.515893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.41841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.229368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Signal-to-noise ratio","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Qualitative data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data"},{"name":"Epitaxy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaxy"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Iron sight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_sight"},{"name":"Drum Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Workshop"},{"name":"Distortion (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics)"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"Canadian National Railway","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway"},{"name":"Motion blur","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur"},{"name":"Council of European Municipalities and Regions","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_European_Municipalities_and_Regions"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
