{"id":46375,"title":"Linear IgA disease associated with ulcerative colitis: the role of surgery.","abstract":"The association of linear IgA disease (LAD) with ulcerative colitis (UC) is well documented. One hypothesis for the association proposes immune exposure to autoantigens present in the colon, and subsequent targeting of these autoantigens in the skin. There are variable reports on the effect of bowel surgery on skin disease in such patients. We report a patient with LAD and UC who required colectomy to control her UC, but whose skin disease failed to resolve following surgery. A literature review revealed that in reported cases of this association, proctocolectomy has resulted in remission of skin disease in all cases where it has been performed, in contrast to variable results seen in cases where colectomy alone was performed.
