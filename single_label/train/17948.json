{"id":17948,"title":"Role of plasma matrix-metalloproteases (MMPs) and their polymorphisms (SNPs) in sepsis development and outcome in ICU patients.","abstract":"Matrix-metalloproteases (MMPs) and their tissue-inhibitors (TIMPs), modulated by different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are critical in sepsis development. Ninety ICU severely septic and 91 ICU uninfected patients were prospectively studied. MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G), MMP-3 (-1612 5A/6A), MMP-8 (-799 C/T), MMP-9 (-1562 C/T), and MMP-13 (-77A/G) SNPs were genotyped. Plasma MMPs (-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -13) and TIMPs (-1,-2,-4) were measured. AA homozygotes and A allele carriers of MMP-13 (-77 A/G) and 1G2G carriers of the MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G) SNPs frequencies were different between septic and uninfected patients (p < 0.05), as well as plasma MMP-3, -8, -9 -10 and TIMP-2 levels (p < 0.04). No differences in MMPs levels among MMP-13 or MMP-1 SNPs genotypes carriers were observed. The area under the ROC curve for MMP-8 in the diagnosis of sepsis was 0.87 (95% CI 0.82-0.92), and that of CRP was 0.98 (0.94-0.998), whereas the area of MMP-9 in the detection of non-septic state was 0.73 (0.65-0.80), p < 0.0001 for all curves. Sepsis associated with increased MMP-8 and decreased MMP-9 levels in multivariate analysis (p < 0.0002). We report for the first time an association between MMP-13 and MMP-1 SNPs and sepsis. An independent association of MMP-8 and MMP-9 levels with sepsis was also observed.
