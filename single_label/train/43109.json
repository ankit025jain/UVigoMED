{"id":43109,"title":"Improved oncologic outcomes with image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy using helical tomotherapy in locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To investigate whether image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) improves survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) relative to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT).Between 2006 and 2011, 187 HCC patients treated with definitive RT were reviewed. Median age was 53(range 51-83). All patients were stage III or IV-A. Concurrent chemoradiation was received by 178 patients (95.2 %). Overall actuarial survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and infield-failure-free survival (IFFS) analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare patient characteristics and treatment-related toxicity between the groups.Sixty-five patients were treated with IG-IMRT and 122 patients with 3D-CRT. No significant differences were seen between the groups for all patient characteristics. IG-IMRT delivered higher doses than 3D-CRT (median biological effective dose 62.5 vs 53.1 Gy, P < 0.001). IG-IMRT showed significantly higher 3-year OS (33.4 vs 13.5 %, P < 0.001), PFS (11.1 vs 6.0 %, P = 0.004), and IFFS (46.8 vs 28.2 %, P = 0.007) than 3D-CRT. On univariate and multivariate analysis, RT modality was significant prognostic factor for OS (HR 2.18; 95 % CI 1.45-3.25; P < 0.001), PFS (HR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.17-2.29; P = 0.004). There was no significant difference between the two modalities for radiation-induced liver disease (P = 0.716).Our findings suggest that IG-IMRT could be an effective treatment that provides survival benefit without increasing severe toxicity in locally advanced HCC.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Digestive System
