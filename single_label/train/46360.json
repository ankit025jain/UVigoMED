{"id":46360,"title":"Anesthetic management in pediatric orthotopic liver transplant for fulminant hepatic failure and end-stage liver disease.","abstract":"We assessed the anesthetic management and short-term morbidity and mortality in pediatrics patients who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant for fulminant hepatic failure or end-stage liver disease in a university hospital.We retrospectively analyzed the records of children who underwent orthotopic liver transplant from May 2002 to May 2012. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: group fulminant hepatic failure (n=22) and group end-stage liver disease (n=19). Perioperative data related to anesthetic management and intraoperative events were collected along with information related to postoperative course and survival to hospital discharge.Mean age and weight for groups fulminant hepatic failure and end-stage liver disease were 8.6 ± 2.7 years and 10.8 ± 3.8 years (P = .04) and 29.2 ± 11.9 kg and 33.7 ± 16.9 kg (P = .46). There were no differences between the groups regarding length of anhepatic phase (65 ± 21 min vs 73 ± 18 min, P = .13) and operation time (9.1 ± 1.6 h vs 9.5 ± 1.8 h, P = .23). When compared with the patients in group fulminant hepatic failure, those in group end-stage liver disease more commonly had a Glasgow Coma score of 7 or less (32% vs 6%, P = .04). Compared with patients in group fulminant hepatic failure, those in group end-stage liver disease were more frequently extubated in the operating room (31.8% versus 89.5% P < .001). Postoperative duration of mechanical ventilation (2.78 ± 4.02 d vs 2.85 ± 10.21 d, P = .05), and the mortality rates at 1 year after orthotopic liver transplant (7.3% vs 0%, P = .09) were similar between the groups.During pediatric orthotopic liver transplant, those children with fulminant hepatic failure require more intraoperative fluids and more frequent perioperative mechanical ventilation than those with end-stage liver disease.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635805","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.76674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.56748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.448388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.447141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"University","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.0960145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
