{"id":55038,"title":"Disparities in visual impairment by immigrant status in the United States.","abstract":"To examine differences in visual impairment between immigrants and natives in the United States (US).This is a cross-sectional study of clinical vision examination data from the 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Analyses compare myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and visual acuity between noncitizens, naturalized citizens, and US natives. Visual acuity variables included having 20/40 or better corrected vision. Differences in 20/20 vision and legal blindness (20/200 or worse) were also examined. Respondents born in the United States were defined as US natives. Foreign-born respondents were categorized as either naturalized US citizens or noncitizen residents. Multivariate logistic regression of outcomes adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, poverty, insurance, diabetes, and surgical correction for eyesight.A smaller percentage of noncitizens than US natives had myopia (18.8% vs 30.7%) or astigmatism (22.0% vs 30.9%). However, noncitizens using corrective lenses had an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0.65 of having 20/20 vision compared to US natives (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.88). Differences in visual acuity for 20/40 and better vision were not statistically significant for corrective lens users. Among nonusers of corrective lenses, noncitizens were significantly less likely than US natives to have 20/40 or better vision (AORÂ = 0.54; 95% CI 0.39-0.74). Noncitizens also had up to 3.5 times the odds of being legally blind relative to US natives after adjusting for confounding factors (95% CI 1.52-7.83).Significant differences in visual acuity exist between immigrants and US natives. More research is necessary to identify underlying factors that may explain these disparities in visual impairment.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034114","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.841674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.829003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.713286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.667649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.549655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Corrective lens","weight":0.52795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_lens"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.453388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.437771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.427174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.309804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Legally blind","weight":0.18535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legally_blind"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Citizenship","weight":0.145004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.13679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Naturalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
