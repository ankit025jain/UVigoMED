{"id":72491,"title":"Vincristine-induced expression of P-glycoprotein in MOLM-13 and SKM-1 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines is associated with coexpression of nestin transcript.","abstract":"Nestin is a class 6 filament protein typically expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells. However, nestin expression has been observed in other tissues during mammalian embryogenesis. In human neural stem/progenitor cells, coexpression of nestin and P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1 member of the ABC transporter family) was detected. P-gp-mediated drug efflux is the most common molecular cause of multidrug resistance in neoplastic cells. Nestin expression has also been detected in various human solid tumours as well as in the corresponding established cell lines. Interestingly, expression of nestin in different leukemia cells has been recently reported. Here, we show that expression of P-gp is associated with the simultaneous expression of nestin in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (MOLM-13 and SKM-1) under the selective pressure of vincristine, a substance that may induce P-gp expression in neoplastic cells.
