{"id":64479,"title":"Dendritic cells and B cells: unexpected partners in Th2 development.","abstract":"Although we have known for decades that B cells contribute to immune responses by secreting Ab, it is now clear that they are more than simply factories for Ig production, and they also play key roles as modulators of T cell-dependent immunity. Indeed, the evidence showing that Ag-presenting and cytokine-producing B cells can alter the magnitude and quality of CD4 T cell responses continues to grow. In this article, we review the data showing that B cells, working in partnership with dendritic cells, regulate the development of Th2 cells and the subsequent allergic response.
