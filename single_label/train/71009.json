{"id":71009,"title":"Wnt/?-catenin pathway in bone cancers.","abstract":"The Wnt signaling pathway regulates some of the crucial aspects of cellular processes. The beta-catenin dependent Wnt signaling (Wnt/?-catenin) pathway controls the expression of key developmental genes, and acts as an intracellular signal transducer. The association of Wnt/?-catenin pathway is often reported with different cancers. In this study, we have reviewed the association of Wnt/?-catenin pathway with bone cancers, focusing on carcinogenesis and therapeutic aspects. Wnt/?-catenin pathway is a highly complex and unique signaling pathway, which has ability to regulate gene expression, cell invasion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation for the initiation and progression of bone cancers, especially osteosarcoma. Association of Wnt/?-catenin pathway with chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and chondroma is also documented. Recently, targeting Wnt/?-catenin pathway has gained significant interests as a potential therapeutic application for the treatment of bone cancers. Small RNA technology to knockdown aberrant Wnt/?-catenin or inhibition of ?-catenin expression by natural component has shown promising effects against bone cancers. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of Wnt signaling and new technologies have facilitated the discovery of agents that can target and regulate Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway, and these may provide a basement for the innovative therapeutic approaches in the treatment of bone cancers.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25117074","annotations":[{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.677763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.582523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.16028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Chondrosarcoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrosarcoma"},{"name":"Bacterial small RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_small_RNA"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment"}]}
