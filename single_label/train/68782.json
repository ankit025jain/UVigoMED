{"id":68782,"title":"Elimination of middle-sized uremic solutes with high-flux and high-cut-off membranes: a randomized in vivo study.","abstract":"The elimination of substances between 10 and 50 kDa by conventional high-flux membranes is not satisfactory. We investigated in vivo the elimination of middle-sized uremic solutes by conventional polyflux (PF) and modified high-cut-off (HCO) membranes. All 12 patients underwent four treatments, two with the HCO dialyzer and two with the PF dialyzer, each in either a haemodialysis (HD) or haemodiafiltration (HDF) mode. The reduction ratio of urea, creatinine, ?2-microglobulin (?2M), leptin, soluble TNF-RI, complement factor D, IL-6, sIL-6 receptor, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and albumin was determined. In addition, the amount removed was determined in the dialysate for ?2M, complement factor D, AGEs and albumin. Treatment with HCO removed ?2M, sTNF-RI, factor D, and high molecular AGE significantly better than conventional high-flux membranes. The albumin loss was higher when using HCO membranes. HCO membranes are a promising approach to improve removal of uremic toxins not affected by conventional high-flux membranes.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496201","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.821432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.782792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.708726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.666597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.561294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.498941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.369223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.260167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Dialysis (biochemistry)","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Uremia","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uremia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Advanced glycation end-product","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Factor D","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_D"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Gear ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_ratio"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Hierarchical Data Format","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format"}]}
