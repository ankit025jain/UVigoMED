{"id":35551,"title":"A novel KCNA1 mutation causing episodic ataxia type I.","abstract":"We describe the clinical phenotype of a novel de novo KNCA1 mutation, and functional characterization of the effects of the mutation on Kv1.1 channel function. HEK293 cells were transfected transiently with either wild-type or mutant channels. Representative currents were evoked after application of a series of square voltage steps from -80 mV to +50 mV in 200-ms intervals from Vh = -80 mV. Extracellular K(+) was added to evoke tail currents. Equal amounts of wild-type and Kv1.1(I262M) mutant DNA were transfected transiently in HEK293 cells to evaluate the influence of the mutation. We found that Kv1.1(I262M) leads to a defective voltage-gated potassium channel. Coexpression studies revealed a dominant-negative effect. We describe the phenotype of a novel KCNA1 mutation causing episodic ataxia. Patch-clamp studies confirm the pathogenicity of the mutation in vitro and suggest that it is dominant with respect to wild-type.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639406","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.789504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.700162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.663385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.542427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Potassium channel","weight":0.489671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.475373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.420261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Episodic ataxia","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_ataxia"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Voltage","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.188149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"HEK cell","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEK_cell"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0797502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Korean Central News Agency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Central_News_Agency"},{"name":"Kv1.1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kv1.1"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Episodic memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory"}]}
