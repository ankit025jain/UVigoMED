{"id":4276,"title":"[Effect of vibration, noise, physical exertion and unfavorable microclimate on carbohydrate metabolism in workers engaged into mining industry and machine building].","abstract":"The authors studied influence of vibration, noise, physical overexertion and microclimate on carbohydrates metabolism and insulin resistance in metal mining industry workers. Findings are that vibration disease appeared to have maximal effect on insulin resistance test results and insulin level. The authors suggested biomarkers for early diagnosis of insulin resistance disorders in metal mining industry workers.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282800","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.68146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.636012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.577528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.291351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.209038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.173741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Microclimate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microclimate"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Exertion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exertion"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
