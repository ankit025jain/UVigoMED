{"id":88404,"title":"Risk of thoracic injury from direct steering wheel impact in frontal crashes.","abstract":"The combination of airbag and seat belt is considered to be the most effective vehicle safety system. However, despite the widespread availability of airbags and a belt use rate of more than 85%, US drivers involved in crashes continue to be at risk of serious thoracic injury. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of steering wheel deformation on driver injury risk in frontal automobile crash.The analysis is based on cases extracted from the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System database for case years 1993 to 2011. The approach was to compare the adjusted odds of frontal crash injury experienced by drivers in vehicles with and without steering wheel deformation.Among frontal crash cases with belted drivers, observable steering wheel deformation occurred in less than 4% of all cases but accounted for 30% of belted drivers with serious (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score, 3+) thoracic injuries. Similarly, steering wheel deformation occurred in approximately 13% of unbelted drivers but accounted for 60% of unbelted drivers with serious thoracic injuries. Belted drivers in frontal crashes with steering wheel deformation were found to have two times greater odds of serious thoracic injury. Unbelted drivers were found to have four times greater odds of serious thoracic injury in crashes with steering wheel deformation. In frontal crashes, steering wheel deformation was more likely to occur in unbelted drivers than belted drivers, as well as higher severity crashes and with heavier drivers.The results of the present study show that airbag deployment and seat belt restraint do not completely eliminate the possibility of steering wheel contact. Even with the most advanced restraint systems, there remains an opportunity for further reduction in thoracic injury by continued enhancement to the seat belt and airbag systems. Furthermore, the results showed that steering wheel deformation is an indicator of potential serious thoracic injury and can be useful to prehospital personnel in improving the diagnosis of serious injuries.Prognostic study, level III.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854313","annotations":[{"name":"Airbag","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag"},{"name":"Crashworthiness","weight":0.842679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crashworthiness"},{"name":"Seat belt","weight":0.783564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.75928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.752284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Automobile safety","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_safety"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.665947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Steering wheel","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"},{"name":"Automotive industry","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"},{"name":"Wheel","weight":0.465988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Safety harness","weight":0.309053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_harness"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Steering","weight":0.201727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0538234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Automotive lighting","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Belted Kingfisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_Kingfisher"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Timing belt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_belt"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Abbreviation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Car seat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_seat"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
