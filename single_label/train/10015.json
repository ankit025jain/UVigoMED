{"id":10015,"title":"Involvement of orexin-A neurons but not melanin-concentrating hormone neurons in the short-term regulation of food intake in rats.","abstract":"In order to elucidate the involvement of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin-A (ORX-A) neurons of the perifornical/lateral hypothalamic areas (PF/LH) in the regulation of food intake induced by acutely reduced glucose availability, we examined the food intake response and c-Fos expression in the MCH and ORX-A neurons in the PF/LH during 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG)-induced glucoprivation (400 mg/kg; i.v.) and systemic insulin-induced hypoglycemia (5 U/kg; s.c.) in male Wistar rats. The administration of both 2DG and insulin stimulated food intake and induced c-Fos expression in the ORX-A neurons corresponding to food intake, but not in the MCH neurons. These data indicate that ORX-A neurons, but not MCH neurons, play a role in the short-term regulation of food intake, and that the input signals for the neurons containing MCH and ORX-A are different, and these neurons play different roles in the regulation of feeding behavior.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676683","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.741545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.688855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.57568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.292857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.250683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Deutsche Grammophon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Grammophon"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"List of feeding behaviours","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_feeding_behaviours"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
