{"id":9756,"title":"Reovirus infections in young broiler chickens.","abstract":"Selected 10-to-21-day-old broiler chickens from flocks undergoing runting-stunting syndrome were found to have significant pancreatic damage, grossly and histologically. Six reoviruses, with sequences that varied, both from each other and from S1133 reovirus, were isolated from these pancreases and from pancreases of specific-pathogen-free leghorn sentinels placed on two of the broiler farms for 7 days.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689195","annotations":[{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Leghorn (chicken)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leghorn_(chicken)"},{"name":"Reoviridae","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reoviridae"},{"name":"Broiler","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler"},{"name":"1133","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1133"},{"name":"Characters in Hamlet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Hamlet"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"}]}
