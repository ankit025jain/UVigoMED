{"id":82182,"title":"Incomplete caries removal and indirect pulp capping in primary molars: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To compare the effect of incomplete caries removal (ICR) and indirect pulp capping (IPC) with calcium hydroxide (CH) or an inert material (wax) on color, consistency and contamination of the remaining dentin of primary molars.This double-blind, parallel-design, randomized controlled trial included 30 children presenting one primary molar with deep caries lesion. Children were randomly assigned after ICR to receive IPC with CH or wax. All teeth were then restored with resin composite. Baseline dentin color and consistency were evaluated after ICR, and dentin samples were collected for contamination analyses using scanning electron microscopy. After 3 months, restorations were removed and the three parameters were re-evaluated. In both groups, dentin became significantly darker after 3 months.No cases of yellow dentin were observed after 3 months with CH compared to 33.3% of the wax cases (P < 0.05). A statistically significant difference over time was observed only for CH regarding consistency. CH stimulated a dentin hardening process in a statistically higher number of cases than wax (86.7% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.008). Contamination changed significantly over time in CH and wax without significant difference between groups. It was concluded that CH and wax arrested the carious process of the remaining carious dentin after indirect pulp capping, but CH showed superior dentin color and consistency after 3 months.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693629","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.803494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.709104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Hydroxide","weight":0.544047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.532919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Wax","weight":0.463623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.317391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Inert","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.182142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Calcium hydroxide","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0554503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Yellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Order of the Companions of Honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour"},{"name":"5' cap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5'_cap"},{"name":"Incomplete (Backstreet Boys song)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_(Backstreet_Boys_song)"},{"name":"Hardening (metallurgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(metallurgy)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Intelligent character recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_character_recognition"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"}]}
