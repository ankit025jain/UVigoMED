{"id":20022,"title":"Role of doxycycline in Clostridium difficile infection acquisition.","abstract":"To evaluate and review the literature surrounding the potential protective benefit of tetracyclines, particularly doxycycline, in reducing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) acquisition.MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched through January 2014 using the search terms doxycycline, tetracycline, and Clostridium difficile.Relevant studies, case reports, and review articles were screened for inclusion. Bibliographies of articles were extensively reviewed for additional sources.Doxycycline is a second-generation tetracycline antibiotic indicated for use in a variety of clinical syndromes and has activity against aerobic Gram-positive and -negative, anaerobic, and atypical bacteria as well as protozoan parasites. Although not used therapeutically to treat CDI, doxycycline may prevent or attenuate the virulence factors of toxigenic C difficile. Current literature does not indicate an increased risk of development of CDI with doxycycline use. In 3 retrospective studies, the use of doxycycline was associated with a protective effect.Doxycycline has been shown to have potential protective effects against the development of CDI. Although further randomized placebo-controlled studies are needed, available data suggest that the use of doxycycline in place of alternative antimicrobials, when appropriate, may be a useful antimicrobial stewardship strategy aimed at reducing the incidence of CDI.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682682","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Tetracycline","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline"},{"name":"Doxycycline","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Tetracycline antibiotics","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.76321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.696544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.549832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.385295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.235029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.145536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
