{"id":88872,"title":"Sclerostin monoclonal antibody enhanced bone fracture healing in an open osteotomy model in rats.","abstract":"Sclerostin is a negative regulator of bone formation. Sclerostin monoclonal antibody (Scl-Ab) treatment promoted bone healing in various animal models. To further evaluate the healing efficiency of Scl-Ab in osteotomy healing, we investigated the time course effects of systemic administration of Scl-Ab on fracture repair in rat femoral osteotomy model. A total of 120 six-month-old male SD rats were subjected to transverse osteotomy at the right femur mid-shaft. Rats were treated with vehicle or Scl-Ab treatment for 3, 6, or 9 weeks. Fracture healing was evaluated by radiography, micro-CT, micro-CT based angiography, 4-point bending mechanical test and histological assessment. Scl-Ab treatment resulted in significantly higher total mineralized callus volume fraction, BMD and enhanced neovascularization. Histologically, Scl-Ab treatment resulted in a significant reduction in fracture callus cartilage at week 6 and increase in bone volume at week 9, associated with a greater proportion of newly formed bone area at week 6 and 9 by fluorescence microscopy. Mechanical testing showed significantly higher ultimate load in Scl-Ab treatment group at week 6 and 9. This study has demonstrated that Scl-Ab treatment enhanced bone healing in a rat femoral osteotomy model, as reflected in increased bone formation, bone mass and bone strength.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782158","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.883669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.703363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.678711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.550608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.520643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.393287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.300978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.232183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.220123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0712715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Biomineralization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
