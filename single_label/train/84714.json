{"id":84714,"title":"[Reactions of the interneuronal synapses of rat brain to hypoxia during the early postnatal period].","abstract":"The reactions of forming synapses in rat neocortex to the effect of hypoxia in the early postnatal period (day 2) were studied. Using immunocytochemistry for synaptophysin demonstratoion and electron microscopic methods, the sensorimotor cortex was studied in rats at days 3, 4 and 10 of postnatal development (6 to 10 animals of each age) in both experimental and control groups (intact animals). Immunocytochemical study of the control animals demonstrated significant differences in the quantitative distribution of synaptophysin-positive structures in the different layers of the neocortex in the early postnatal period of development (day 5). It is shown that after exposure to perinatal hypoxia, more than 2-fold decrease of the optical density of the immunocytochemical reaction product took place together with the reduction of synaptophysin-positive granules distribution density in all cortical layers of. At the same time, electron-dense terminals demonstrating early degenerative processes were found. In the neuropil of the neocortex, a sharp decline in the number of growth cones, small processes and forming synapses was accompanied by significant changes of the electron density of synaptic, especially post-synaptic, membranes and densities. In the experimental animals, the number of growth cones and emerging synaptic structures were shown to increase only by postnatal day 10. Thus, the effects of hypoxia in the early postnatal period, causing disturbances of synaptogenesis, persist throughout the whole neonatal period examined.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051793","annotations":[{"name":"Neocortex","weight":0.884947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.712961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Synaptogenesis","weight":0.574558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptogenesis"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.363434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Motor cortex","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Cone cell","weight":0.190311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0947559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Electron density","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_density"},{"name":"Synaptophysin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptophysin"},{"name":"Growth cone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_cone"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"Neuropil","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropil"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Sensorimotor","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorimotor"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
