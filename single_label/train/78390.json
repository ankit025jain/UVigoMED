{"id":78390,"title":"Deaf culture: competencies and best practices.","abstract":"To successfully navigate in the hearing world, deaf individuals must be able to read and write to bridge the gap when others do not know American Sign Language. Unfortunately, 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents and do not develop language skills early on, which negatively impacts their ability to access health information and healthcare. Healthcare providers must ensure they provide culturally competent care and their practices accommodate the needs of deaf patients to mitigate communication barriers and ensure equitable care with positive health outcomes.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681696","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.71795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"American Sign Language","weight":0.634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.50703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Deaf culture","weight":0.37989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture"},{"name":"Sign language","weight":0.359599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.326445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Climate change mitigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation"},{"name":"Egalitarianism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism"},{"name":"Language barrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_barrier"},{"name":"Cultural competence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_competence"}]}
