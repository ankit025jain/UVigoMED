{"id":21652,"title":"Impact of HIV co-infection on plasma level of cytokines and chemokines of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.","abstract":"The immunologic environment during HIV/M. tuberculosis co-infection is characterized by cytokine and chemokine irregularities that have been shown to increase immune activation, viral replication, and T cell dysfunction.We analysed ex vivo plasma samples from 17 HIV negative and 16 HIV pulmonary tuberculosis co infected cases using Luminex assay to see impact of HIV co-infection on plasma level of cytokines and chemokines of pulmonary tuberculosis patients before and after anti Tuberculosis treatment.The median plasma level of IFN-?, IL-4, MCP-3, MIP-1? and IP-10 was significantly different (P?<?0.05) before and after treatment in HIV negative TB patients but not in HIV positive TB patients. There was no significant difference between HIV positive and HIV negative TB patients (P?>?0.05) in the plasma level of any of the cytokines or chemokines before treatment and anti TB treatment did not change the level of any of the measured cytokines in HIV positive tuberculosis patients. The ratio of IFN-?/IL-10 and IFN-?/IL-4 showed a significant increase after treatment in HIV negative TB cases but not in HIV positive TB cases which might indicate prolonged impairment of immune response to TB in HIV positive TB patients as compared to HIV negative tuberculosis patients.HIV positive and HIV negative Tuberculosis patients display similar plasma cytokine and chemokine pattern. However, anti TB treatment significantly improves the Th1 cytokines and level of chemokines but does not restore the immune response in HIV positive individuals.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592945","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.890117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.833729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.830605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Viral replication","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_replication"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.640716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.569644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.401824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.359981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.349045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.259797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Macrophage inflammatory protein","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_inflammatory_protein"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"HIV-positive people","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive_people"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
