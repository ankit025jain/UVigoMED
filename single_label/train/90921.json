{"id":90921,"title":"Effect of oxygen-breathing during a decompression-stop on bubble-induced platelet activation after an open-sea air dive: oxygen-stop decompression.","abstract":"We highlighted a relationship between decompression-induced bubble formation and platelet micro-particle (PMP) release after a scuba air-dive. It is known that decompression protocol using oxygen-stop accelerates the washout of nitrogen loaded in tissues. The aim was to study the effect of oxygen deco-stop on bubble formation and cell-derived MP release.Healthy experienced divers performed two scuba-air dives to 30 msw for 30 min, one with an air deco-stop and a second with 100% oxygen deco-stop at 3 msw for 9 min. Bubble grades were monitored with ultrasound and converted to the Kisman integrated severity score (KISS). Blood samples for cell-derived micro-particle analysis (AnnexinV for PMP and CD31 for endothelial MP) were taken 1 h before and after each dive.Mean KISS bubble score was significantly lower after the dive with oxygen-decompression stop, compared to the dive with air-decompression stop (4.3 ± 7.3 vs. 32.7 ± 19.9, p < 0.001). After the dive with an air-breathing decompression stop, we observed an increase of the post-dive mean values of PMP (753 ± 245 vs. 381 ± 191 ng/?l, p = 0.003) but no significant change in the oxygen-stop decompression dive (329 ± 215 vs. 381 +/191 ng/?l, p = 0.2). For the post-dive mean values of endothelial MP, there was no significant difference between both the dives.The Oxygen breathing during decompression has a beneficial effect on bubble formation accelerating the washout of nitrogen loaded in tissues. Secondary oxygen-decompression stop could reduce bubble-induced platelet activation and the pro-coagulant activity of PMP release preventing the thrombotic event in the pathogenesis of decompression sickness.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563091","annotations":[{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.842147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.722376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.47463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Decompression stop","weight":0.448912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_stop"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.146642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Scuba diving","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Kiss (band)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"Lomwe language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomwe_language"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0184033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"381","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/381"},{"name":"753","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/753"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Void coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_coefficient"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Washout (aviation)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washout_(aviation)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Liquid bubble","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble"},{"name":"Microparticles","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microparticles"}]}
