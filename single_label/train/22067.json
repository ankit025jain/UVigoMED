{"id":22067,"title":"Lyme disease: neurology, neurobiology, and behavior.","abstract":"The Lyme disease controversy can be largely linked to the misconception that neurobehavioral effects of illness constitute evidence of nervous system infection. Appropriate differentiation between neuroborreliosis (nervous system Borrelia burgdorferi infection) and Lyme encephalopathy (altered nervous system function in individuals with systemic but not nervous system infection)-or encephalopathies of other etiologies-would lessen the controversy considerably, as the attribution of nonspecific symptoms to supposed ongoing central nervous system infection is a major factor perpetuating the debate. Epidemiologic considerations suggest that the entities referred to as \"posttreatment Lyme disease\" and \"chronic Lyme disease\" may not actually exist but rather reflect anchoring bias, linking common, nonspecific symptoms to an antecedent medical event. On the other hand, there are data suggesting possible mechanisms by which posttreatment Lyme disease could occur.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571864","annotations":[{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.743979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.722947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.460237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Borrelia burgdorferi","weight":0.203312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia_burgdorferi"},{"name":"List of infections of the central nervous system","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_infections_of_the_central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Borrelia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia"},{"name":"Neuroborreliosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroborreliosis"},{"name":"Nonspecific symptoms","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonspecific_symptoms"},{"name":"Transfer function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"News presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Attribution (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology)"}]}
