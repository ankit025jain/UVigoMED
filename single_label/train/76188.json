{"id":76188,"title":"[Magnesium deficiency and dysregulation of vascular tone].","abstract":"Magnesium deficiency is associated with impaired vascular tone bidirectionally and can lead to both an abnormal increase and abnormal lowering of blood pressure. This article analyzes studies on the relationship between blood pressure parameters and the level of magnesium in the blood. Evidence base for the use of magnesium for correction of vascular tone is presented.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177816","annotations":[{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.835991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.507968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.230647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Magnesium deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Timbre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre"},{"name":"Vascular resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_resistance"},{"name":"Astrogliosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
