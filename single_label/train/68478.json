{"id":68478,"title":"Dialysis and acute kidney injury: current evidence.","abstract":"Optimization of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for severe acute kidney injury (AKI) has been intensively studied over the last decade. Several large recently published randomized trials have clarified uncertainties regarding dialysis modality selection as well as dialysis dosage. This information will help inform decision makers regarding resource allocation and establishment of treatment targets. The decision to initiate dialysis remains a clinical one, based on individual patient needs. Despite technological advances in renal replacement therapy, AKI continues to be associated with poor outcomes.
