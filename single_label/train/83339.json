{"id":83339,"title":"[Pathogenesis of plaque destabilization induced by PM2.5 exposure and coping strategies].","abstract":"With the increasingly more serious environmental pollution in China in recent years, effective intervention with PM25-induced health risks has become a major scientific issue to be addressed urgently in medical research field in China. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a family of cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors that have critical roles in innate immunity. On the basis of study progresses in international cardiovascular disease research \"Fine particulate matter exposure is a modifiable risk factor for the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases\", and with reference to the current understanding of pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress in PM2.5-induced acute coronary syndrome, this study intended to investigate whether intracellular pattern recognition NL-RP3 plays a important role in the inital event of PM2.5 induced vessel inflammation as a foreign matter in the process of plaque destabilization and to thoroughly explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for PM2.5-induced acute cardiovascular events. On the other hand, it also studies the feasibility of using traditional Chinese medicine to treat plaque destabilization cause by PM2.5 exposure and discuss it's pathogenesis and intervention strategy based on TCM theory. This paper in order to provide scientific basis for social focal issues in public health proactively and offers the references for relevant research.","date":"2014-11-26","categories":"Pathological
