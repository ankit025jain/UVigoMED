{"id":56020,"title":"Residual stereopsis in age-related macular degeneration patients and its impact on vision-related abilities: a pilot study.","abstract":"To determine the effect of residual stereopsis on vision-related abilities of low vision (LV) patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Prospective non-randomized observational case series. Inclusion criteria included documented AMD, LV with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/50-20/400 in the better eye, and ages between 50 and 90 years. Stereoacuity was measured using the near Frisby Stereotest. Vision related abilities were documented with the VA LV VFQ-48 questionnaire.Twenty-seven subjects with mean age of 84±6 years old were recruited, of which 59.3% (16/27) were female. 59.3% (16/27) of the subjects were not able to see any stereoacuity plate, 25.9% (7/27) had stereoacuity of 340s of arc (SOA), 11.1% (3/27) had stereoacuity of 170 SOA and 3.7% (1/27) had stereoacuity of 85 SOA. The mean Overall Functional Visual Abilities (OFVA) score was significantly higher in those with stereopsis (2.25±0.99) than those without stereopsis (1.50±0.92) (P=0.028).LV patients with stereopsis have better OFVA than those without. Stereopsis should be considered as a component of LV rehabilitation and considered as an outcome measure in research and clinical practice.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766867","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.729189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.702357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.556501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.363613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.310842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Stereopsis","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereopsis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Low vision","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_vision"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"1627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1627"},{"name":"846","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/846"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Service-oriented architecture","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Social exclusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion"},{"name":"Frisby, Leicestershire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisby,_Leicestershire"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
