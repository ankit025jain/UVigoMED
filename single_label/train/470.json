{"id":470,"title":"Annular bullous lesions with atypical erythema multiforme in leprosy.","abstract":"Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune complex-mediated reaction that may complicate the course of multibacillary leprosy. Bullous lesions in Type II reaction, though reported, are exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 32 year old female patient who presented initially at our OPD with erythema nodosum. Cutaneous examination revealed impaired sensation over dorsum of right foot and thickened right lateral popliteal nerve. Slit skin smear (SSS) from ear lobes revealed AFB with a bacteriological index of 2+. She was started on MDT, tablet ofloxacin 200 mg twice a day, and 30 mg oral prednisolone. Two months later, she presented with generalised pruritus, large target lesions over the back, and hemorrhagic bullae over lower extremities and annular pattern of bullae, over both arms. A SSS was repeated which was positive for AFB. Histopathology from bullous lesions was consistent with ENL. Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) study was negative. Our patient improved rapidly after she was started on thalidomide 100 mg twice daily, with withdrawal of ofloxacin. Erythema Multiforme (EMF) and annular bullous lesions have been reported in patients on treatment with ofloxacin. This case is being presented due to the unusual and varied manifestation of Type II lepra reaction in a 34 year old female patient.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509721","annotations":[{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.865099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.816503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Erythema nodosum","weight":0.801676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_nodosum"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Erythema multiforme","weight":0.71431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_multiforme"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Ofloxacin","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofloxacin"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
