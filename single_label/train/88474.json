{"id":88474,"title":"Spinal angiolipoma manifesting with apoplexy.","abstract":"We report a 58-year-old man presenting with acute paraplegia. MRI showed a haematoma within a well-defined epidural lesion at C7-D1. Intraoperatively, organised epidural haematoma surrounded by tumour tissue was found. The final histopathology report was angiolipoma. The patient had dramatic recovery. Angiolipomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute paraplegia when imaging shows well-circumscribed haematoma.
