{"id":14831,"title":"MicroRNA-133a regulates insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor expression and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in murine atherosclerosis.","abstract":"MicroRNA-133a (miR-133a) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are two different molecules known to regulate cardiovascular cell proliferation. This study tested whether miR-133a affects expression of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and proliferation of IGF-1-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in a murine model of atherosclerosis.Expression of IGF-1R was analyzed by immuno-fluorescence and immuno-blotting, and miR-133a by qRT-PCR in the aortas of wild-type C57BL/6J (WT) and apolipoprotein-E deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Compared to those in WT aortas, the IGF-1R and miR-133a levels were lower in ApoE(-/-) aortas. ApoE(-/-) VSMC grew slower than WT cells in the cultures with IGF-1-containing medium. MiR-133a-specific inhibitor decreased miR-133a, IGF-1R expression, IGF-1-stimulated VSMC growth in lipoprotein deficient media. By contrast, miR-133a precursor increased IGF-1R levels and promoted IGF-1-induced VSMC proliferation. In the luciferase-IGF-1R 3'UTR reporter system, the reporter luciferase activity was not inhibited in VSMC with miR-133a overexpression. IGF-1R mRNA half-life in ApoE(-/-) VSMC was shorter than that in WT VSMC. MiR-133a inhibitor reduced but precursor increased the mRNA half-life, although the effects appeared less striking in ApoE(-/-) VSMC than in WT cells.MiR-133a serves as a stimulatory factor for IGF-1R expression through prolonging IGF-1R mRNA half-life. In atherosclerosis induced by ApoE deficiency, reduced miR-133a expression is associated with lower IGF-1R levels and suppressive VSMC growth. Administration of miR-133a precursor may potentiate IGF-1-stimulated VSMC survival and growth.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401233","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.916687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.822399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.746087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Vascular smooth muscle","weight":0.604271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_smooth_muscle"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.407454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.360173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor","weight":0.329701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.321274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.317819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.225845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
