{"id":36141,"title":"The use of fontaine leads in the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.","abstract":"We report a case of a 68-year-old man admitted to the emergency department with syncope preceded by rapid palpitations. His admission ECG demonstrated a sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). This report highlights the importance of distinguishing ventricular tachycardia caused by arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) from the more benign idiopathic RVOT-VT. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the Fontaine leads placement in increasing the sensitivity for uncovering epsilon waves, a highly specific electrocardiographic feature that increases diagnostic accuracy in patients with ARVD.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597934","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.847196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.76437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.629032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.579486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.565589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.541636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","weight":0.299665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmogenic_right_ventricular_dysplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Epsilon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Outflow (meteorology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
