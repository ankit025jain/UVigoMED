{"id":62530,"title":"[Investigation on chromatogram-pharmacodynamics relationship of Angelica sinensis on effect of replenishing blood].","abstract":"Blood deficiency model of mice was copied by subcutaneous injection with 200, 100 and 100 mg x kg(-1) (0.01 mL x g(-1)) acetyl phenylhydrazine (APH) at the frist, fourth, and seventh days. Mice in each group were perfused with different extracted parts of Angelica sinensis (drug dosage was 2.4 g x kg(-1)) at the tenth day, once a day for 10 days. Then compare the influence of different extracted parts of Angelica sinensis to RBC, Hb, PLT and thymus, spleen and weight changes of blood deficiency mice. The peak areas of each common peak from HPLC fingerprint were associated with the date of replenishing blood pharmacodynamics efficacy by using gray relation statistic, which was used to research the chromatogram-pharmacodynamics relationship. The results showed that the part of DSC has the better effect in replenishing blood. The contribution degree of the DSC to replenishing blood of each component were determined by correlation size, and ferulic acid made the largest contribution, but contribution of other components should not be ignored. In this paper, we research the relationship of the HPLC fingerprint and spectrum activity relationship, determine the material basis of the DSC for replenishing blood, and provide effective way to represent the spectral correlation effect.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
