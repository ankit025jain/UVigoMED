{"id":65484,"title":"Management of advanced prostate cancer - role of the urologist.","abstract":"There now exists an enhanced opportunity for urologists to continue to successfully identify, treat, and manage advanced prostate cancer patients in partnership with our medical oncology and radiation oncology colleagues. For urologists and their supporting staff who are dedicated to caring for patients with advanced prostate cancer, there are novel therapies that delay disease progression, maintain - and oftentimes improve - quality-of-life metrics, and prolong overall survival. These therapies are not unusually difficult to manage, nor are they too intimidating with regard to understanding their mechanisms of action and respective safety profiles. They provide the opportunity to improve and enhance patient care, as well as to further augment the urological role in both the academic and community multidisciplinary prostate cancer clinic.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817261","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.599871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.292857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.235535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Staff (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Intimidation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
