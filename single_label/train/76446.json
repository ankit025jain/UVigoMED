{"id":76446,"title":"Vitamin D and macular thickness in the elderly: an optical coherence tomography study.","abstract":"Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with age-related macular degeneration. Our objective was to determine whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration was associated with macular thickness among older adults with no signs of macular dysfunction.The mean serum 25OHD concentration was 61.2 ± 26.3 nmol/L. Patients with vitamin D insufficiency had a reduced macular thickness compared to those without (232.9 ± 40.4 ?m vs. 253.3 ± 32.1 ?m, P = 0.042). After adjustment for potential confounders, vitamin D insufficiency was associated with a decreased macular thickness (? = -59.4 ?m, P = 0.001). Consistently, the participants with vitamin D insufficiency had a 3.7-fold higher risk of having abnormally low macular thickness compared with those with sufficient 25OHD level (P = 0.042).Vitamin D insufficiency was associated with reduced macular thickness among older patients with no patent macular dysfunction. This implies that vitamin D insufficiency may be involved in macular thinning, and provides a scientific base for vitamin D replacement trials in age-related macular degeneration.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028353","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.727589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.696316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.474321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.221729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.206001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.109541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.061283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0583776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Objective (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"}]}
