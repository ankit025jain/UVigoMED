{"id":20321,"title":"Polymyxins for the treatment of extensively-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: from pharmacokinetics to bedside.","abstract":"The initial use of polymyxins, polymyxin B and colistin (administered as a pro-drug colistin methanesulfonate sodium [CMS]), mostly relied on old pharmacokinetic (PK) studies that lacked appropriate methodology. In recent years, many PK studies in both animals and humans have provided more consistent evidence supporting better use of these invaluable antibiotics. However, translating preclinical data to clinical practice is not always an easy task and some may experience difficulties on how recent knowledge on polymyxins can be applied into the patients' care. Although many questions are still unresolved, there are consistent data able to improve clinical practice when prescribing initial and maintenance doses of both polymyxin B and CMS. Considering the importance of optimal use of polymyxins, this editorial discusses recent PK findings and how to take advantage of them at the bedside to improve the treatment of patient with extensively-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections.
