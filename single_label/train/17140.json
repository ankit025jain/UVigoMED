{"id":17140,"title":"Living-donor kidney transplant in T-cell and B-cell flow cytometry crossmatch-positive patients.","abstract":"Complement-dependent cytotoxic crossmatch is an important indicator for kidney transplant. However, there is controversy about treatment for flow cytometry crossmatch-positive cases.This was a retrospective study of 127 living-donor kidney transplant recipients from May 2007 to July 2011. We divided patients into 115 flow cytometry crossmatch T-cell and B-cell-negative cases, and 12 T-cell and B-cell-positive cases. Both groups were given 20 mg basiliximab the day of surgery and 4 days after surgery. Common oral immunosuppressive agents used were tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Flow cytometry crossmatch T-cell and B-cell-negative recipients started immunosuppression 7 days before surgery, T-cell and B-cell-positive recipients started immunosuppression 14 days before surgery. T-cell and B-cell-positive patients also received 200 mg rituximab 1 week before surgery, had 3 plasma exchange sessions before transplant, and received intravenous immunoglobulin 20 g/day during surgery and after surgery for 5 days. We measured flow-panel reactive antibodies of T-cell and B-cell-positive patients just before surgery to check desensitization efficiency. We evaluated patient survival, graft survival, graft function, and frequency of rejection and infectious diseases.Patient survival and graft survival were 100% in both groups. Flow cytometry crossmatch T-cell and B-cell-positive cases had no rejection events, but T-cell and B-cell-negative groups developed rejection. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of infection and graft function. Flow-panel reactive antibody demonstrated improvement in all T-cell and B-cell-positive cases.In living-donor kidney transplant, flow cytometry crossmatch T-cell and B-cell-positive patients are still considered to be at high risk. Although this is a short-term outcome, all T-cell and B-cell-positive patients in this study achieved excellent results with appropriate preoperative and postoperative treatment.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907723","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Mycophenolate mofetil","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolate_mofetil"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.80327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Basiliximab","weight":0.779325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basiliximab"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.692802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.656494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.569636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.239585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Cross-matching","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-matching"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
