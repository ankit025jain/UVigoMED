{"id":68114,"title":"Stress urinary incontinence: usefulness of perineal ultrasound.","abstract":"Perineal ultrasound provides the most sensitive assessment of the degree of urethral mobility by measuring the pubo-urethral distance and angle. To evaluate whether these indices may be determinants of success in prosthetic surgery for stress urinary incontinence, we conducted a retrospective study of patients treated with tension-free vaginal tape-obturator (TVT-O) surgery and assessed, by measuring the pubo-urethral distance and angle after TVT-O, whether there was any quantitative difference between the mean values measured in the group of cured patients and uncured patients.We selected 51 patients who underwent TVT-O and evaluated the failure rate by means of urogynaecological assessment. We also measured, using perineal ultrasound, the mean values of the pubo-urethral distance and angle between the two groups of patients.We recorded a difference in the average pubo-urethral distance of 3 mm ± 1.2 at rest and 2.7 mm ± 1.2 under stress and a difference in the average pubo-urethral angle of 13° ± 6.3° at rest and 8° ± 6.3° under stress between the two groups.We obtained higher mean values of pubo-urethral distance and angle in uncured patients compared to those found in the group of cured patients.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557982","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.709989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.691454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.504189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.338889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.210525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.196588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.115282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0487476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Index (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
