{"id":51587,"title":"Management of a prediabetes case with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin.","abstract":"It is important to prevent or slow the progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and, therefore, reduce the risk of long-term complications. New therapeutic options will allow more patients to be effectively managed. Although theorized to be effective for prediabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have not been studied in this population. The purpose of this article is to report the results of a case in which a patient with prediabetes was treated with the DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin.A 56-year-old woman was diagnosed with prediabetes at a hemoglobin A1C (A1C) of 6.2%. After 6 months of consistent lifestyle modifications, her A1C was 6.3%, and she wanted to start a medication to prevent disease progression. Because of anticipated risk or intolerability with standard prediabetes treatments, she was started on sitagliptin 100 mg daily; 6 weeks later, she noted improvements in glucometer readings. After 18 months on sitagliptin, her A1C had improved to 5.8% without further lifestyle improvements, and by 32 months, her A1C had improved to 5.6%. Her A1C was maintained within or below the prediabetes range of 5.7% to 6.4% over 3 years of treatment with sitagliptin.Although human studies with DPP-4 inhibitors are lacking, the available studies have shown improvements in ?-cell function and postprandial and fasting glucose levels. Furthermore, animal studies have shown a delay in progression of prediabetes. No case reports have been found regarding DPP-4 inhibitor use in prediabetes.Sitagliptin may have a role in treating prediabetes and should be further studied.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676549","annotations":[{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.874968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose meter","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_meter"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.66368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.548005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.248912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
