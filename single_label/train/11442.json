{"id":11442,"title":"Ischaemic conditioning strategies for the nephrologist: a promise lost in translation?","abstract":"Over the last quarter of a century, a huge effort has been made to develop interventions that can minimise ischaemia reperfusion injury. The most potent of these are the ischaemic conditioning strategies, which comprise ischaemic preconditioning, remote ischaemic preconditioning and ischaemic postconditioning. While much of the focus for these interventions has been on protecting the myocardium, other organs including the kidney can be similarly protected. However, translation of these beneficial effects from animal models into routine clinical practice has been less straightforward than expected. In this review, we examine the role of ischaemic conditioning strategies in reducing tissue injury from the 'bench to the bedside' and discuss the barriers to their greater translation.
