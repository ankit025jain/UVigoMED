{"id":46438,"title":"The effect of dietary oils on the development of aberrant crypt foci, bifidobacteria and fecal pH.","abstract":"The present study investigated the relationship between intestinal bifidobacteria and intake of commercial dietary oils of different fatty acids compositions on the development of aberrant crypt foci (ACF). Wistar rats were grouped according to diet and treatment with dimethylhydrazine (DMH): standard diet (CN), canola oil (CAN), olive oil (OLI), corn oil (COR), standard diet and DMH (CNDMH), canola oil and DMH (CANDMH), olive oil and DMH (OLIDMH) and corn oil and DMH (CORDMH). Diets and DMH did not alter the amount of bifidobacteria, fecal pH and serum total cholesterol level. DMH-treated groups had lower serum triglyceride levels compared to respective controls without DMH. Olive and corn oil diets resulted in higher hepatic cholesterol levels than standard diet under treatment with DMH. The numbers of ACF/field and cell proliferation were lower under treatment with CANDMH and OLIDMH, suggesting a protective effect of these oils on colorectal carcinogenesis.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632973","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Canola","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Olive oil","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Maize","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium","weight":0.641171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.630783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.532872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Olive","weight":0.505161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.462786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Corn oil","weight":0.451941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_oil"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.4394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Dieting","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Cyanide","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
