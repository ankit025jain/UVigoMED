{"id":7937,"title":"Genetic heterogeneity of bovine noroviruses in Italy.","abstract":"By screening 104 faecal samples from asymptomatic calves in Italy, bovine norovirus RNA was detected with a prevalence rate of 10.5 % (11/104). A continuous sequence spanning the RdRp region and the 5' end of the capsid gene was generated for 7 of the 11 strains. Upon phylogenetic analysis, five strains were grouped with GIII.2 Newbury2-like viruses, and one strain was grouped with GIII.1 Jena-like noroviruses. Interestingly, one strain (80TE/IT) was genetically related to the GIII.1/Jena/80/De in the RdRp but resembled the GIII.2/Newbury2/76/UK in the capsid gene, suggesting a recombination event occurring in the ORF1/ORF2 junction region.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824347","annotations":[{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.872036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.631496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.618581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.617398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.473566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.274709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0853846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Newbury, Berkshire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbury,_Berkshire"},{"name":"ORF eins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORF_eins"},{"name":"ORF2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORF2"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Jena","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena"}]}
