{"id":51692,"title":"Aggressive variants of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas: a cytopathologist's perspective.","abstract":"Follicular cell-derived carcinomas of the thyroid gland comprise a heterogeneous group of malignant neoplasms of the thyroid gland with varied histologic appearance and molecular profiles. In most patients, these tumors represent relatively indolent neoplasms; however, certain subtypes/variants behave in an aggressive manner, and the recognition of this subset of tumors is essential because of their variable response to therapy and significant morbidity and mortality. Fine-needle aspiration is considered an essential tool for the diagnosis of suspicious thyroid nodules. In this review, the authors discuss the clinical, histologic, and molecular findings and the prognostic implications of aggressive thyroid neoplasms with emphasis on the characteristic cytomorphologic features on fine-needle aspiration smears.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664970","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.632376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.539713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.433738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.395489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.220177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Thyroid neoplasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_neoplasm"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"}]}
