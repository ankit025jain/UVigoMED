{"id":32135,"title":"[Identification of an exhumed unknown infant through DNA analysis].","abstract":"The article reports on the exhumation and subsequent DNA analysis of the skeletal remains of an unknown male newborn from 1988. Molecular biological methods confirmed the maternity of a woman who was already convicted of infanticide. Since homicide could not be clearly proven and manslaughter becomes barred by the statute of limitation after 20 years, the woman cannot be held accountable for the alleged killing of her first child.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004622","annotations":[{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.733523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Manslaughter","weight":0.659956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Statute of limitations","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations"},{"name":"Homicide","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide"},{"name":"Infanticide","weight":0.208333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide"},{"name":"Statute","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Conviction","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"1988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Accountability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability"},{"name":"Burial","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial"}]}
