{"id":61100,"title":"Effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine combined with trichostatin A on RPMI-8226 cell proliferation, apoptosis and DLC-1 gene expression.","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the effects of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on DLC-1 gene transcription regulation and molecular biological behaviours in the human multiple myeloma RPMI-8226 cells. The cells were treated respectively with 5-Aza-CdR and TSA alone, or the both combination; the cell proliferation and apoptosis, DLC-1 expression, the protein expression of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) were examined by CCK-8 method, RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The results showed that the 5-Aza-CdR and TSA had cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects in dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Compared with a single drug (5-Aza-CdR or TSA alone), the effects were significantly enhanced after treatment with the combination of 5-Aza-CdR and TSA (P < 0.05). DLC-1 was weakly expressed in the control group; the treatment with 5-Aza-CdR alone enhanced its re-expression dose-dependently (P < 0.05). Compared with 5-Aza-CdR alone, 5-Aza-CdR plus TSA enhanced DLC-1 re-expression significantly.Compared with the control, 5-Aza-CdR and TSA significantly decreased RhoA and Rac1 protein expression (P < 0.05). It is concluded that 5-Aza-CdR and TSA can effectively reverse DLC-1 expression of RPMI-8226 cells; TSA has a synergistic effect on its re-expression. 5-Aza-CdR and TSA have significant cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects on RPMI-8226 cells. These effects may be related to the inhibition of Rho/Rho kinase signalling pathway.
