{"id":71495,"title":"[Vitamin D and cancer].","abstract":"Vitamin D acts through vitamin D receptor, expressed in a variety of human tissues, including cancer tissues of various origins. Basic research has a revealed vitamin D has anti-cancer potentials including pro-differentiation, anti-proliferation, anti-inflammation, anti-angiogenesis and many other effects. Epidemiological studies have revealed that low serum 25 (OH) D level, i.e. vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, is associated with higher incidence in colon cancer. Low serum 25 (OH) D level in colon or breast cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis. Despite these results, clinical studies so far have not demonstrated any effects of vitamin D supplementation on cancer incidence or prognosis. Many large randomized controlled studies are in-progress now about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cancer. Their results are anticipated.
