{"id":35021,"title":"Budget impact analysis of antiepileptic drugs for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.","abstract":"In October 2011, clobazam was FDA-approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a debilitating childhood epilepsy characterized by drop attacks, for patients 2 years and older.To assess the budget impact of adding clobazam to an antiepileptic drug (AED) portfolio containing topiramate, lamotrigine, and rufinamide in a hypothetical, 100,000-member commercially insured health plan.Patient characteristics and AED efficacy (decrease in drop-seizure frequency) were modeled with clinical data. Medical costs were derived from administrative claims data from a large U.S. managed health plan, with the assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures required medical care. Two-year budget impact was measured. Results were expressed as the overall difference in costs (medical and pharmacy) to a health plan and cost per member per month (PMPM) after addition of clobazam. Analyses of alternative scenarios were performed.With the assumption that 0.04% of the plan population had LGS, adding clobazam to the formulary resulted in cost savings of $98,059 in year 1 and $131,690 in year 2 (savings of $0.08 and $0.11 PMPM, respectively). Analyses of alternative scenarios with lower seizure rates upon discontinuation or greater long-term efficacy for lamotrigine and topiramate did not substantially alter conclusions. The assumption that fewer drop seizures required medical care resulted in a savings of approximately $5,000 per year with clobazam, which suggested that medically attended drop seizures drive costs.Medically attended drop seizures are a major cost driver for LGS patients. Adding clobazam to a health plan formulary can have a positive overall budget impact through decreased medical costs associated with drop seizures.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684645","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.696211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.621073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.465752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.374227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Topiramate","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiramate"},{"name":"Lamotrigine","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine"},{"name":"Health policy","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Clobazam","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobazam"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Rufinamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufinamide"},{"name":"Cost driver","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_driver"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Budget","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Impact analysis","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_analysis"},{"name":"Formulary (pharmacy)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulary_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Health care prices","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices"},{"name":"Lahore Grammar School","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore_Grammar_School"}]}
