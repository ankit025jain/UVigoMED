{"id":55214,"title":"Collagen copolymer toric phakic intraocular lens for myopic astigmatism: one-year follow-up.","abstract":"To assess the predictability, stability, safety, and efficacy of a collagen copolymer toric phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) to correct moderate and high astigmatism.Fernández-Vega Ophthalmological Institute, Oviedo, Spain.Case series.After implantation of the TV4b toric Implantable Collamer Lens pIOL, the uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, refraction, toric pIOL vault, and adverse effects were evaluated over 12 months.The study enrolled 35 eyes of 20 patients with a mean sphere of -5.46 diopters (D) ± 4.17 (SD) and mean cylinder of -3.14 ± 1.19 D. At 12 months, the mean sphere was -0.04 ± 0.16 D, with 97% of eyes being within ±0.50 D of the target (r(2) = 0.99), and the mean cylinder was -0.29 ± 0.42 D. For the astigmatism components, 80% of eyes were within ±0.25 D of both J0 (r(2) = 0.99) and J45 (r(2) = 0.99). The mean decimal UDVA was 0.89 ± 0.16 and the mean decimal CDVA, 0.95 ± 0.12. No eye lost lines of CDVA, and 43% of eyes gained 1 or more lines. The safety index was 1.08 at 12 months. More than 50% of eyes had a Snellen UDVA of 20/20. The efficacy index was 0.97 at 3 months and 1.01 at 12 months.The visual and refractive outcomes were good and highly stable throughout the follow-up, indicating that this toric pIOL model is predictable, safe, and effective in correcting low and high levels of astigmatism.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957435","annotations":[{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.791621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.760622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.710266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.495859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.487088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Camera lens","weight":0.209853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lens"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.20132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Decimal","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Copolymer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer"},{"name":"TV4 (Sweden)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV4_(Sweden)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Oviedo","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviedo"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Proprietary software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"}]}
