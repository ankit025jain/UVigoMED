{"id":88382,"title":"Can we enhance fracture vascularity: What is the evidence?","abstract":"Angiogenesis is a vital component of bone healing. The formation of the new blood vessels at the fracture site restores the hypoxia and nutrient deprivation found at the early stages after fracture whilst at a later stage facilitates osteogenesis by the activity of the osteoprogenitor cells. Emerging evidence suggests that there are certain molecules and gene therapies that could promote new blood vessel formation and as a consequence enhance the local bone healing response. This article summarizes the current in vivo evidence on therapeutic approaches aiming at the augmentation of the angiogenic signalling during bone repair.
