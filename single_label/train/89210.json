{"id":89210,"title":"Lateral foot pain following open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture of the fifth metatarsal tubercle: treated by arthroscopic arthrolysis and endoscopic tenolysis.","abstract":"We report a case of fracture of the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal which was managed by tension band wiring and bone grafting. It was complicated by symptomatic fibrosis of the operated site involving the cubometatarsal joint, peroneus brevis tendon, peroneus tertius tendon and the long extensor tendon to the fifth toe. This was successfully managed by arthroscopic lysis of the involved joint and tendons.
