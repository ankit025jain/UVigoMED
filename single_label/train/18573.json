{"id":18573,"title":"[Endoscopic sclerosis with pneumatic distension for pyriform sinus fistula treatment].","abstract":"Classic treatment for pyriform sinus fistula (PSF) has been surgical excision; however, less invasive therapeutic alternatives whose aim is the obliteration of the sinus have been described subsequently. The authors present a technical modification of endoscopic sclerosis with diathermy (ESD): continuous infusion of air flow through the flexible endoscope was used to distend the pyriform sinus and facilitate recognition of the fistula opening. The sinus obliteration was performed with a wire guide and diathermy. In the last 15 years, 9 patients were diagnosed of suffering from PSF in our institution. Initial treatment was antibiotics therapy associated in some cases to cervical abscess drainage. Fistulectomy was performed in 4 cases and ESD in 4. The ninth patient received both treatments, performing electrocauterization after a surgical recurrence. Three of the patients who underwent surgery relapsed; none treated by ESD did, or had any complications. In our experience, endoscopic sclerosis with pneumatic distension is a simple technique, reproducible, not invasive and very effective; hence we consider it might become a first line therapy for PSF.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783638","annotations":[{"name":"Diathermy","weight":0.900742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathermy"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.868176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.824742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.763775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.345466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Piriform sinus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piriform_sinus"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Electrostatic discharge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"People's Students Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Students_Federation"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
