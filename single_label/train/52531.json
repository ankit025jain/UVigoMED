{"id":52531,"title":"Ectopic calcification in diabetic vascular disease.","abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases represent over one-half of all deaths in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In diabetic patients, vascular calcifications are more frequently observed than in people without diabetes. In particular, elevated degrees of coronary artery and valvular calcifications are reported in populations with diabetes.We will present and discuss findings from clinical and basic science studies that investigate the pathophysiological processes leading to exaggerated arterial/valve calcification in diabetic patients. We will also illustrate the likely effects of the current therapies on vascular calcification progression in diabetic patients. A special focus will be dedicated to the contribution of resident/circulating calcifying cells to the calcific processes observed under diabetic conditions.Interest in the topic of ectopic calcification in diabetic vascular disease is expanding and more knowledge is adding on its mechanisms and consequences. Importantly, new therapeutic targets are emerging, implying possible future chances to modulate vascular calcification for cardiovascular protection.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593833","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.719142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.712861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.57403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Calcium carbonate","weight":0.537647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.230524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.184226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fundamental science","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_science"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Dystrophic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophic_calcification"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
