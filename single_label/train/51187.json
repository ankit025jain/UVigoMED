{"id":51187,"title":"Can GLP-1 preparations be used in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus?","abstract":"The number of young diabetics is increasing and therapeutic options for these patients are limited. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted from the gut after meals and enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, suppresses appetite, and delays the gastric-emptying rate. GLP-1 analogs are already widely used in the adult population to improve glycemic control and induce weight loss in overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes. The glucose-lowering effects resulting from the inhibition of glucagon secretion and the gastric-emptying rate could be of clinical importance in type 1 diabetes. In this article we review clinical data regarding the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in youth and address the potential benefits and safety aspects of these compounds. Large scale clinical trials are still needed in the pediatric population.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716398","annotations":[{"name":"Glucagon","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.815539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.751693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.435076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.363126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
