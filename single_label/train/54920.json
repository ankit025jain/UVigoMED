{"id":54920,"title":"[Penetrating keratoplasty in high-risk children: prevention of graft rejection].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of prolonged courses of systemically administered subtherapeutic Metipred and cyclosporine in prevention of graft rejection in high-risk children.The study included 27 children at high risk of graft rejection due to re-keratoplasty (n = 8), limbo-keratoplasty for corneal staphyloma (n = 4), or transplantation into vascularized corneal bed (n = 15). All patients were divided into two groups--the study group (n =11) and the control group (n = 16). In order to evaluate the efficacy of two different prevention schemes, the occurrence of graft rejection, rejection crises, and crisis-associated clouding of the transplant was analyzed.The occurrence of transplant opacity was two times lower in the Metipred-cyclosporine group than in the conventional prevention group. Kaplan-Meier one-year survival of the transplant was 53% in the study group and 27% in the control group. Two-year survival rate difference appeared even more significant--53% and 18% correspondingly.It is clinically shown that subtherapeutic use of Metipred and cyclosporine decreases the occurrence of rejection crises and transplant failure almost by half in high-risk patients as compared with topical corticosteroids; at the same time the side effects of systemic immunosuppression are not substantial. Thus, the suggested prevention scheme allows to perform keratoplasty and expect a clear transplant in children who previously were considered inoperable, i.e. with total vascularized corneal opacity, giant staphylomas, and corneal burns.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098116","annotations":[{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.472176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.219696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.194444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.158256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.116551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.032361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Scheme (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"}]}
