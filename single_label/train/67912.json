{"id":67912,"title":"Bolus administration of intravenous glucose in the treatment of hyperkalemia: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"Hyperkalemia is a common medical emergency that may result in serious cardiac arrhythmias. Standard therapy with insulin plus glucose reliably lowers the serum potassium concentration ([K(+)]) but carries the risk of hypoglycemia. This study examined whether an intravenous glucose-only bolus lowers serum [K(+)] in stable, nondiabetic, hyperkalemic patients and compared this intervention with insulin-plus-glucose therapy.A randomized, crossover study was conducted in 10 chronic hemodialysis patients who were prone to hyperkalemia. Administration of 10 units of insulin with 100 ml of 50% glucose (50 g) was compared with the administration of 100 ml of 50% glucose only. Serum [K(+)] was measured up to 60 min. Patients were monitored for hypoglycemia and EKG changes.Baseline serum [K(+)] was 6.01 ± 0.87 and 6.23 ± 1.20 mmol/l in the insulin and glucose-only groups, respectively (p = 0.45). At 60 min, the glucose-only group had a fall in [K(+)] of 0.50 ± 0.31 mmol/l (p < 0.001). In the insulin group, there was a fall of 0.83 ± 0.53 mmol/l at 60 min (p < 0.001) and a lower serum [K(+)] at that time compared to the glucose-only group (5.18 ± 0.76 vs. 5.73 ± 1.12 mmol/l, respectively; p = 0.01). In the glucose-only group, the glucose area under the curve (AUC) was greater and the insulin AUC was smaller. Two patients in the insulin group developed hypoglycemia.Infusion of a glucose-only bolus caused a clinically significant decrease in serum [K(+)] without any episodes of hypoglycemia.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576893","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Hyperkalemia","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalemia"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.727627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.335781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.265315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.226731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.131971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"}]}
