{"id":63722,"title":"Waldenström macroglobulinemia: from biology to treatment.","abstract":"Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is distinct B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder primarily characterized by bone marrow infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells along with production of a serum monoclonal (IgM). In this review, we describe the biology of WM, the diagnostic evaluation for WM with a discussion of other conditions that are in the differential diagnosis and clinical manifestations of the disease as well as current treatment options. Within the novel agents discussed are everolimus, perifosine, enzastaurin, panobinostat, bortezomib and carfilzomib, pomalidomide and ibrutinib. Many of the novel agents have shown good responses and have a better toxicity profile compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents, which makes them good candidates to be used as primary therapies for WM in the future.
