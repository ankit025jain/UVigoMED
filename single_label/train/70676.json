{"id":70676,"title":"Methylation-regulated miR-149 modulates chemoresistance by targeting GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 in human breast cancer.","abstract":"Dysregulation of microRNA is strongly implicated in the chemoresistance of cancer. In this study, we found that miR-149 was downregulated and involved in chemoresistance in adriamycin (ADM)-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADM). Downregulation of miR-149 was related to hypermethylation of its 5'-UTR; this methylation also affected the expression of the glypican 1 gene, which is both the host and the target gene of miR-149. Furthermore, we found that miR-149 modulated chemoresistance through targeting the expression of GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST1). With downregulated miR-149, NDST1 expression was increased in chemoresistant MCF-7/ADM cells versus control MCF-7 wild-type cells. The increased NDST1 then activated a heparan sulfate-related pathway involving activation of heparanase. Finally, expression of miR-149 and NDST1 was confirmed in clinical chemoresistant samples of breast cancers receiving anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapies. The high expression of NDST1 was also an unfavorable predictor for distant relapse-free survival in Her2 and basal breast cancers. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-149 is regulated by methylation, and is a modulator of cancer chemoresistance by targeting NDST1.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25156775","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.464437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.447072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.353562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.314167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.227711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Heparan sulfate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparan_sulfate"},{"name":"Archer Daniels Midland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland"},{"name":"N-Acetylglucosamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Acetylglucosamine"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"}]}
