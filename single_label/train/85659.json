{"id":85659,"title":"Use of combined suspension laryngoscopy and jet ventilation for Y-shaped airway stents delivery.","abstract":"Airway stenting is a common endoscopic procedure that is used to treat a variety of central airway lesions. Obstructions or fistulas involving the carina or nearby tracheobronchial structures require the use of specially designed stents, commonly referred to as Y-stents. Conventional methods of endobronchial Y-stent delivery are all characterized by a blind and apneic period during the procedure that carries the risk of stent misplacement or ventilation/oxygenation problems or both. Using combined suspension laryngoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, and jet ventilation, we describe a technique that makes challenging bronchoscopic interventions--such as self-expandable Y-shaped airway stent delivery--easy, precise, and safe.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882315","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tracheobronchial tree","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheobronchial_tree"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.701037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Carina of trachea","weight":0.685256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_of_trachea"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.614481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Jet engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
