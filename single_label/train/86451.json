{"id":86451,"title":"T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors can cause anaphylaxis in humans.","abstract":"T cells can be redirected to overcome tolerance to cancer by engineering with integrating vectors to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). In preclinical models, we have previously shown that transfection of T cells with mRNA coding for a CAR is an alternative strategy that has antitumor efficacy and the potential to evaluate the on-target off-tumor toxicity of new CAR targets safely due to transient mRNA CAR expression. Here, we report the safety observed in four patients treated with autologous T cells that had been electroporated with mRNA coding for a CAR derived from a murine antibody to human mesothelin. Because of the transient nature of CAR expression on the T cells, subjects in the clinical study were given repeated infusions of the CAR-T cells to assess their safety. One subject developed anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest within minutes of completing the third infusion. Although human anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies have been known to develop with CAR-transduced T cells, they have been thought to have no adverse clinical consequences. This is the first description of clinical anaphylaxis resulting from CAR-modified T cells, most likely through IgE antibodies specific to the CAR. These results indicate that the potential immunogenicity of CARs derived from murine antibodies may be a safety issue for mRNA CARs, especially when administered using an intermittent dosing schedule.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777247","annotations":[{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.812649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.795537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.634441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.582679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.514458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.449442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.445044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.240554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Mesothelin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelin"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
