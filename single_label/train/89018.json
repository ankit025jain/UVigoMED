{"id":89018,"title":"Civilian gunshot injuries of the humerus.","abstract":"An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was performed at a level 1 trauma center to evaluate the adequacy of current treatment guidelines in the management of humerus fractures following civilian gunshot injuries. Fifty-four patients with a humerus shaft fracture from a low-velocity gunshot wound were included in the study. Twenty-nine patients were treated nonoperatively, while 25 patients had operative treatment, with 14 undergoing plate fixation, 6 having application of an external fixator, 3 receiving an intramedullary rod, and 2 having irrigation and debridement with fracture immobilization provided by a brace. Patient demographics and injury data, radiographic analyses, and treatment complications were recorded. Healing of soft tissue and bony injuries, including fracture alignment in patients treated nonoperatively, was also evaluated. Fifty-two of 54 patients had minor soft tissue damage and were treated successfully with minimal local wound care. Two patients with larger wounds required extended wound care with repeated irrigation and debridement. Overall, 47 of 54 fractures healed with the primary mode of treatment, and 7 patients went on to nonunion requiring further intervention. Of the patients treated nonoperatively, the average deformity was 16.5°±7.4° in the coronal plane and 4.4°±4.0° in the sagittal plane. This study supports the view that the majority of humerus fractures following civilian gunshot wounds may be treated nonoperatively, with a select group of patients requiring surgical stabilization.
