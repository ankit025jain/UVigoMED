{"id":12673,"title":"Influenza A immunomics and public health omics: the dynamic pathway interplay in host response to H1N1 infection.","abstract":"Towards unraveling the influenza A (H1N1) immunome, this work aims at constructing the murine host response pathway interactome. To accomplish that, an ensemble of dynamic and time-varying Gene Regulatory Network Inference methodologies was recruited to set a confident interactome based on mouse time series transcriptome data (day 1-day 60). The proposed H1N1 interactome demonstrated significant transformations among activated and suppressed pathways in time. Enhanced interplay was observed at day 1, while the maximal network complexity was reached at day 8 (correlated with viral clearance and iBALT tissue formation) and one interaction was present at day 40. Next, we searched for common interactivity features between the murine-adapted PR8 strain and other influenza A subtypes/strains. For this, two other interactomes, describing the murine host response against H5N1 and H1N1pdm, were constructed, which in turn validated many of the observed interactions (in the period day 1-day 7). The H1N1 interactome revealed the role of cell cycle both in innate and adaptive immunity (day 1-day 14). Also, pathogen sensory pathways (e.g., RIG-I) displayed long-lasting association with cytokine/chemokine signaling (until day 8). Interestingly, the above observations were also supported by the H5N1 and H1N1pdm models. It also elucidated the enhanced coupling of the activated innate pathways with the suppressed PPAR signaling to keep low inflammation until viral clearance (until day 14). Further, it showed that interactions reflecting phagocytosis processes continued long after the viral clearance and the establishment of adaptive immunity (day 8-day 40). Additionally, interactions involving B cell receptor pathway were evident since day 1. These results collectively inform the emerging field of public health omics and future clinical studies aimed at deciphering dynamic host responses to infectious agents.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512282","annotations":[{"name":"B
