{"id":66943,"title":"Anderson-hynes pyeloplasty in patients less than 12 months old. Is the laparoscopic approach safe and feasible?","abstract":"The aim of our study is to compare the outcomes of open and laparoscopic pyeloplasty in children less than 12 months of age.We reviewed all medical charts of patients less than 12 months old who underwent pyeloplasty from January 2007 to February 2013. We divided them in two groups: Open pyeloplasty (OP) and laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP). The following data were analyzed: age, sex, weight, US measurements, operative time, hospital stay, complications, and success rate. Quantitative data were analyzed with the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test or Fisher test for qualitative data.Fifty-eight patients (46 boys and 12 girls) with a mean age of 4.66 months (Â±3.05) were included. Mean age was 4.25 months and 5.15 months in OP and LP group respectively. Mean weight was 6.78?kg and 7.02?kg in OP and LP groups. There were no statistical differences in age, weight, and sex between OP and LP groups. There were no statistical differences in preoperative ultrasonography measurements. Mean posterior-anterior (PA) pelvis diameter was 28.57?mm and 23.94?mm in OP and LP groups, respectively. Mean calices diameter were 10.86?mm and 10.96?mm in OP and LP groups, respectively. Mean operative time was 129.53 minutes in the OP group and 151.92 minutes in the LP group with statistical differences (P=0.018). Mean hospital stay was 6.34 days in the OP group and 3.46 in the LP group with statistical differences (P<0.05). No intraoperative and postoperative complications were found in either group. Hydronephrosis improved in all patients, and no patient needed a repeated pyeloplasty.The laparoscopic approach of Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty in patients less than 12 months old is a safe procedure with the same outcomes as the open approach.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661042","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.358411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.196588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Numerical data","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_data"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Hydronephrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronephrosis"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dominican Order","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"5.15","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.15"},{"name":"Belgian general election, 2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_general_election,_2007"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Qualitative data","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Pyeloplasty","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeloplasty"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"}]}
