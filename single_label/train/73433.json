{"id":73433,"title":"A new clinical cut-off of cytokeratin 19 mRNA copy number in sentinel lymph node better identifies patients eligible for axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer.","abstract":"Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA copy number predicts the probability of tumour load in axillary lymph nodes (ALN) and can help in decision-making regarding the axillary dissection. The purpose of this study was to define a new cut-off of CK19 mRNA copy number using the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay on metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in order to identify cases at risk of having one or more positive ALN.1296 SLN from 1080 patients were analysed with the OSNA assay. 194 patients with positive SLN underwent ALN dissection and the mean value of CK19 copy number (320?000) of their SLN was set as initial cut-off. Receiver operative characteristics curve identify a best cut-off of 7700 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 57%). A comparison between our and the traditional cut-off (5000) was performed.The cut-off of 7700 successfully identifies patients with positive ALN (p=0.001, false- negative cases: 17%). In the range between 5000 and 7700, one patient with positive ALN would not undergo axillary dissection, whereas eight patients with negative ALN would be correctly identified.We suggest that the level of CK19 mRNA copy number could be the only parameter to consider in the intraoperative management of the axilla.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906358","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.878594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.860628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.706523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.61704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.576261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.530739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.346651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0193344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"}]}
