{"id":21304,"title":"[Epidemiology and prophylaxis of community-acquired pneumonia in servicemen].","abstract":"Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the most pressing issues for military medicine in connection with a high incidence among conscripts. After the vaccination beginning in 2002, the uninterrupted increase of the pneumonia incidence that had been observed in 90-th years was changed to the tendency of decrease. But in 2009 and 2010 the incidence of pneumonia increased significantly in all military districts because of crowded conditions of accommodation and activation of \"mixing\" of personnel in connection with reduction of military service period from 2 and 1.5 years to 1 year. The improvement of accommodation conditions and prevention of excessive cooling are the bases of prevention of pneumonia. It is recommended to use bactericidal air recycling apparatus in barracks. Medicament prophylaxis consists of vaccination with polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumo 23) together with influenza vaccine. It is necessary to approve in the troops conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar 13), which was registered in Russia 2 years ago. Vaccination should be combined with the use of immunotropical and antivirus medication, vitamins.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
