{"id":9625,"title":"Novel rope-based sampling of classical swine fever shedding in a group of wild boar showing low contagiosity upon experimental infection with a classical swine fever field strain of genotype 2.3.","abstract":"Several classical swine fever (CSF) epidemics in wild boar and domestic pigs in Europe during the last decades have been caused by CSF virus (CSFV) strains of genotype 2.3. This genotype is known to be virulent leading to high morbidity and mortality. We experimentally infected two eight months old wild boar with 10(5,5) TCID50 of CSFV genotype 2.3 and kept the animals together with five noninoculated wild boar of the same age. Our original purpose was to evaluate a non-invasive sampling method based on saliva collection using \"rope-in-a-bait\" sampling baits. While expecting high morbidity, high level of virus shedding and some mortality, we actually observed a subclinical course of infection with an unexpected low contagiosity. The two inoculated animals infected only three contact animals while two contact animals remained uninfected. These findings substantially add to our epidemiological understanding of CSFV circulation in wild boar populations. CSFV infected animals older than six months and in good condition may not shed sufficient virus to transmit infection to all seronegative in-contact animals. The contagiosity in relation to the animal's age is discussed. This supports the hypothesis of silent perpetuation of CSFV in wild boar populations for several months if the wild boar density is sufficiently high. The feasibility of the \"rope-in-a-bait\" sampling method could be proven during the short viraemic phase of infected animals during the second week of infection.
