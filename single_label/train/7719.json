{"id":7719,"title":"Specific alterations in the performance of learning and memory tasks in models of chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus.","abstract":"Cognitive impairment is a common comorbidity in patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). These impairments, particularly deficits in learning and memory, can be recapitulated in chemoconvulsant models of TLE. Here, we used two relatively low-stress behavioral paradigms, the novel object recognition task (NOR) and a spatial variation, the novel placement recognition task (NPR) to reveal deficits in short and long term memory, in both kainic acid (KA) and pilocarpine (Pilo) treated animals. We found that both KA- and Pilo-induced significant deficits in long term recognition memory but not short term recognition memory. Additionally, KA impaired spatial memory as detected by both NPR and Morris water maze. These deficits were present 1 week after SE. The characterization of memory performance of two chemoconvulsant-models, one of which is considered a surrogate organophosphate, provides an avenue for which targeted cognitive therapeutics can be tested.
