{"id":77124,"title":"Safety, pharmacokinetic, and functional effects of the nogo-a monoclonal antibody in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomized, first-in-human clinical trial.","abstract":"The neurite outgrowth inhibitor, Nogo-A, has been shown to be overexpressed in skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); it is both a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. We performed a double-blind, two-part, dose-escalation study, in subjects with ALS, assessing safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and functional effects of ozanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A. In Part 1, 40 subjects were randomized (3?1) to receive single dose intravenous ozanezumab (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo. In Part 2, 36 subjects were randomized (3?1) to receive two repeat doses of intravenous ozanezumab (0.5, 2.5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo, approximately 4 weeks apart. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (adverse events [AEs], vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests). Secondary endpoints included PK, immunogenicity, functional endpoints (clinical and electrophysiological), and biomarker parameters. Overall, ozanezumab treatment (0.01-15 mg/kg) was well tolerated. The overall incidence of AEs in the repeat dose 2.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ozanezumab groups was higher than in the repeat dose placebo group and repeat dose 0.5 mg/kg ozanezumab group. The majority were considered not related to study drug by the investigators. Six serious AEs were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab; none were considered related to study drug. No study drug-related patterns were identified for ECG, laboratory, or vital signs parameters. One subject (repeat dose 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) showed a weak, positive anti-ozanezumab-antibody result. PK results were generally consistent with monoclonal antibody treatments. No apparent treatment effects were observed for functional endpoints or muscle biomarkers. Immunohistochemical staining showed dose-dependent co-localization of ozanezumab with Nogo-A in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, single and repeat dose ozanezumab treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated co-localization at the site of action. These findings support future studies with ozanezumab in ALS.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841795","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.733178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.709475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.599312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.513693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.444769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
