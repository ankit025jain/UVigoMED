{"id":7984,"title":"[Immune efficacy in mice by recombinant pseudorabies virus PGO expressing ORF2 gene of porcine circovirus type 2].","abstract":"We developed a recombinant pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).PCV2 ORF2 gene was inserted into vector pG to produce the recombinant PRV vector pGO; the genome of PRV attenuated vaccine and the transfer plasmid pGO were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent into swine testis cells for homologous recombination to obtain the recombinant PRV. Six-week-old female Kunming mice were immunized two intramuscular immunizations 4 weeks apart, and then challenged with the virulent PCV2 NY strain at 8 weeks after the first immunization.A recombinant PRV expressing PCV2 ORF2 was successfully constructed, and named PGO. There was a low ELISA antibody level of PCV2-specific humoral immune response elicited by recombinant virus PGO for the first immunization but high significantly for the second immunization. PCV2 antigen-specific T-cell proliferative responses can be elicited by immunization with recombinant virus. Challenge experiments show that the recombinant virus and PCV2 inactivated vaccine could both protect the mice against PCV2 challenge, suggesting that the recombinant virus can be an excellent potential vaccine.The results show the recombinant PRV expressing PCV2 ORF2 had good immunogenicity.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818470","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.866808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.825521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Homologous recombination","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.767719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.679493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.473429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Pseudorabies","weight":0.220726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorabies"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.215536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Porcine circovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcine_circovirus"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Recombinant virus","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_virus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"}]}
