{"id":51148,"title":"ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in the small intestine of type 2 diabetic rats.","abstract":"Inflammation of the small intestine may occur in type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate whether ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) were altered in chronic inflammation of the small intestine of type 2 diabetic rats.Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Eight rats in the control group were fed with regular chow, and 24 rats were fed a high-fat diet and injected with a single low dose of streptozotocin. All of the control rats and diabetic rats were bred for 10 months. Immunohistochemistry detected ABCA1 and ABCG1 in the small intestine in all the rats.Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed chronic inflammation in the small intestine of the diabetic rats. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that alteration of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was different in the inflammatory and epithelial cells. Quantitative analysis showed that the overall expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 increased in the diabetic rats compared to the control rats. Both ABCA1 and ABCG1 were enriched in the inflammatory cells of the small intestine in diabetic rats. In the epithelial cells, ABCA1, but not ABCG1, was detected in significantly more diabetic rats than control rats.Both ABCA1 and ABCG1 are enriched in chronic inflammation of the small intestine of type 2 diabetic rats. ABCA1, but not ABCG1, is activated in the intestinal epithelial cells of type 2 diabetic rats.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719980","annotations":[{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.802814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.781232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.570101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0311489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Quantitative analysis (chemistry)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(chemistry)"},{"name":"ABCA1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCA1"},{"name":"Plant breeding","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_breeding"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Chow Chow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_Chow"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Intestinal epithelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_epithelium"},{"name":"American Baseball Coaches Association","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Baseball_Coaches_Association"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
