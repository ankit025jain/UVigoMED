{"id":88278,"title":"Pelvic crescent fractures: variations in injury mechanism and radiographic pattern.","abstract":"Pelvic crescent fracture, also known as sacroiliac fracture-dislocation, is traditionally considered as a lateral compression injury and a vertically stable injury. Thirty consecutive cases were analyzed and it was found that 63% of cases were caused by lateral compression (LC), 27% by anteroposterior compression (APC), and 10% by vertical shear (VS). APC and VS injuries cause significant displacement of the anterior iliac fragment, but 21% of LC injury cases showed minimal displacement and were treated successfully with nonoperative treatment. Different injury mechanisms also produce different types of pelvic instability. More important, different injury mechanisms produce distinct radiographic fracture patterns regarding the obliquity of the fracture line and fracture surface. These differences in the fracture pattern will influence the decision of internal fixation options. Therefore, treatment of pelvic crescent fractures should be based on individual analysis of injury mechanism and radiographic fracture pattern.
