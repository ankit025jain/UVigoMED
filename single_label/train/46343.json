{"id":46343,"title":"Long-term maintenance of sustained virological response in liver transplant recipients treated for recurrent hepatitis C.","abstract":"The recurrence of hepatitis C viral infection is common after liver transplant, and achieving a sustained virological response to antiviral treatment is desirable for reducing the risk of graft loss and improving patients' survival.To investigate the long-term maintenance of sustained virological response in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C recurrence.436 Liver transplant recipients (74.1% genotype 1) who underwent combined antiviral therapy for hepatitis C recurrence were retrospectively evaluated.The overall sustained virological response rate was 40% (173/436 patients), and the mean follow-up after liver transplantation was 11Â±3.5 years (range, 5-24). Patients with a sustained virological response demonstrated a 5-year survival rate of 97% and a 10-year survival rate of 93%; all but 6 (3%) patients remained hepatitis C virus RNA-negative during follow-up. Genotype non-1 (p=0.007), treatment duration >80% of the scheduled period (p=0.027), and early virological response (p=0.002), were associated with the maintenance of sustained virological response as indicated by univariate analysis. Early virological response was the only independent predictor of sustained virological response maintenance (p=0.008).Sustained virological response achieved after combined antiviral treatment is maintained in liver transplant patients with recurrent hepatitis C and is associated with an excellent 5-year survival.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635906","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"524","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/524"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Minuscule 436","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_436"}]}
