{"id":7977,"title":"Whole-genome analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) from eastern China.","abstract":"The complete genome sequence of a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus variant, strain SHQP/YM/2013, from China was determined and compared with those of other porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses. The full-length genome was 28,038 nucleotides (nt) in length without the poly (A) tail, and it was similar to that of other reported PEDV strains, with the characteristic gene order 5'-replicase (1a/1b) -S-ORF3-E-M-N-3'. Nucleotide sequence analysis based on individual virus genes indicated a close relationship between the S gene of SHQP/YM/2013 and those of the four Korean field strains from 2008-2009. Its ORF3 gene, however, fell into three groups. Recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates were divided between group 1 and group 3, which suggests that the recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates represent a new genotype that differs from the genotype that includes the vaccine strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the M gene, ORF3 gene and S gene, our study demonstrated that prevalent PEDV isolates in China may have originated from Korean strains. This report describes the complete genome sequence of SHQP/YM/2013, and the data will promote a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates in eastern China.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818713","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.82545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Polyadenylation","weight":0.731945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.668012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.614344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.59426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.401451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Suidae","weight":0.331591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suidae"},{"name":"Molecular epidemiology","weight":0.265993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_epidemiology"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.223258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Polyphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Gene orders","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_orders"}]}
