{"id":84757,"title":"[Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy in children].","abstract":"It was described the results of endosurgical treatment different technique of 170 children of both sexes aged 4 months to 14 years. Children had inguinal hernia. There were unilateral hernia in 148 patients and bilateral hernia in 22 patients. It was used such interventions as laparoscopic herniotomy with hernial sac extirpation (6 operations), laparoscopic suturing of deep inguinal ring (22 operations), dual-port laparoscopic extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy (46 operations), original single-port laparoscopic extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy (118 operations). The minimum duration of the operation (4.5-7.5 minutes) was observed in the last group. These patients did not need postoperative anesthesia. Relapse was detected in 2 (1.1%) cases. Developed single-port laparoscopic extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy may be alternative in children with inguinal hernia.
