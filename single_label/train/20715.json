{"id":20715,"title":"Effects of two different solutions used in pin site care on the development of infection.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two different solutions used for pin site care in patients with external fixators on the incidence of pin site infection.The study included 133 pins of 18 patients. The patient identification form, pin site care application form and the pin tract infection assessment form developed by Checketts et al. were used as data collection tools. On the condition that it would be evenly applied on the number of pins available in a patient, a 10% povidone-iodine solution was used in the care of 68 pin sites and 2 mg/ml chlorhexidine was applied at 65 pin sites. Infections developing in the pin sites were graded and recorded. Pin site care was applied routinely on a daily basis until the patient was discharged.Infection was observed in 19 (27.9%) of the 68 pins of patients in the povidone-iodine group. Infection developed in only 6 (9.2%) of 65 pins in the chlorhexidine group.Use of 2 mg/ml chlorhexidine in pin site care appears to decrease the prevalence of pin tract infection.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643105","annotations":[{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Economic development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
