{"id":43594,"title":"HCV antigen testing for the diagnosis of hepatitis C infection: a cost-efficient algorithm.","abstract":"In North America, diagnosis of active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is currently performed using RNA testing which is highly sensitive and specific but is associated with three major limitations: lability of RNA molecules, higher costs, and longer turn-around time as compared with commercially-available HCV core antigen testing. In the current study, a new HCV core antigen assay product was evaluated for the diagnosis of HCV infection and its cost reducing potential.Ninety plasma specimens positive for HCV RNA along with 25 negative HCV specimens were used for HCV antigen assay. Twenty-four specimens positive for a panel of agents were used for possible cross-reactivity. Sixty-four HCV antibody-positive specimens with negative HCV RNA and indeterminate HCV immunoblot results were also employed.In the first group, 78/90 (86.6%) tested positive for HCV antigen with regression analysis showing no significant deviation from linearity. None of the prenatal specimens tested positive for HCV antigen. Non-specific reactions were not observed. In the HCV antibody-indeterminate group, only 2/64 (3.1%) were antigen positive. In the last group, none of the HCV antibody very-low-positive specimens tested positive for HCV antigen. Both inter- and intra-run reproducibility of 100% were noted. The cost analysis showed a minimum of 52.13% reduction in costs associated with qualitative RNA testing.Considering the complexity of HCV infection diagnosis and the significant cost and turn-around time burden it imposes on clinical laboratories, HCV antigen testing seems an attractive adjunct to the current battery of laboratory diagnosis that demands more attention.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779304","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.790718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.651273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.641814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.56748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.548185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.459674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Pseudobulbar affect","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect"}]}
