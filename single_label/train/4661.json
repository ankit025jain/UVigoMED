{"id":4661,"title":"Comparison of salivary calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels in children with early childhood caries after administration of milk, cheese and GC tooth mousse: an in vivo study.","abstract":"This study compares the Salivary Calcium, Phosphate and Alkaline Phosphataselevels in children with Early Childhood Caries after administration of Milk, Cheese and GC Tooth Mousse to a control group of caries resistant children.90 kindergarten children both males and females aged 5 years, from the South Canara region were included in the study. Based on the dmfs score, children were divided into 3 groups: Control group, ECC group and S-ECC group. The Salivary Calcium, Phosphate and Alkaline Phosphatase levels in the sample were assessed before and after administration of Milk, Cheese and GC Tooth Mousse at three different intervals, i.e within 5 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes by using Spectrophotometry.The mean Salivary Calcium levels were higher in caries free group whereas Phosphate and Alkaline Phosphatase were lower in the caries free group which was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). The Tooth Mousse group showed higher bioavailability of calcium and phosphate which was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). Salivary Calcium and Phosphate levels within 5 minutes after application of Milk, Cheese and Tooth Mousse were higher than at 30 and 60 minutes. Salivary Alkaline Phosphatase levels were lower than the baseline values at all the 3 intervals after administration of Milk, Cheese and Tooth Mousse and was statistically not significant (p > 0.05).Saliva should be saturated with Calcium and Phosphate to affect their bioavailability in amounts adequate for remineralizaton. Milk, Cheese and GC Tooth Mousse applicaton were equally beneficial in saturating the saliva with adequate amount of Calcium and Phosphate.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571682","annotations":[{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.810022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.727826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.727804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.556318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Recaldent","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recaldent"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Cheese","weight":0.260696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mousse","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousse"},{"name":"Free group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_group"},{"name":"Kindergarten","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten"},{"name":"Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Exhibition_and_Conference_Centre"},{"name":"South Canara","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Canara"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Early childhood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Kanara","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanara"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
