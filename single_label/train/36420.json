{"id":36420,"title":"[Post-surgical gout after total hip arthroplasty - a case report].","abstract":"The following report deals with the case of a post-surgical gout after total hip arthroplasty. Before surgery, the patient was diagnosed with hyperuricaemia. Following the procedure, the patient developed superinfected gout tophi and several joint infections. Multiple surgeries were necessary to control the illness and to finally heal the infection. This study stresses pre-surgical hyperuricaemia as a severe illness and demonstrates a positive medical history of gout as a risk for post-surgical precipitation of uric acid. We hope to increase the surgeon's awareness of post-surgical gout symptoms in order to ensure adequate patient care.
