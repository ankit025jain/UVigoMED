{"id":22911,"title":"Effect of systemic high dose vitamin C therapy on forearm blood flow reactivity during endotoxemia in healthy human subjects.","abstract":"Acute inflammation induced by administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) reduces plasma concentrations of vitamin C and impairs vascular endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity. We tested the hypothesis that systemically administered high dose vitamin C restores the endogenous anti-oxidant potential and improves NO-dependent vasodilatation in the forearm vasculature.36 male subjects were enrolled in this balanced, placebo controlled cross-over study. Forearm blood flow (FBF) reactivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and glyceryl-trinitrate (GTN), a sensitive test for endothelial function, was assessed at baseline and 4h after LPS-administration (20 IU/kg i.v). The effect of two different doses of intravenous vitamin C (Vitamin C-InjektopasÂ®), 320 mg/kg and 480 mg/kg over 2h, or placebo on forearm vascular function was studied after LPS.LPS caused transient flu-like symptoms, decreased plasma vitamin C concentrations and reduced the ACh-dependent increase in FBF by up to 76%. Vitamin C at a mean plasma concentration of 3.2 or 4.9 mmol/L restored the response to ACh compared to baseline.High dose systemic vitamin C recovers LPS-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the forearm resistance vasculature. This provides a rationale for a further clinical study of the systemic vitamin C effect under inflammatory conditions.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512733","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.768994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.759549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.604126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.470133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Endotoxemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxemia"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"}]}
