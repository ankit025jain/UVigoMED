{"id":28347,"title":"Serial monitoring of sedation scores in benzodiazepine overdose.","abstract":"Benzodiazepines are widely used for many diseases, and benzodiazepine overdose is globally increasing in proportion to its prescriptions. Although most benzodiazepine overdoses are known to be safe and nonfatal without coingestions, morbidity or mortality after benzodiazepine overdose is closely related with the duration of unconsciousness or depth of compromised airway. Proper use of flumazenil, a potent antidote of benzodiazepine, seems to accelerate the recovery from the toxicity after benzodiazepine overdose.However, as the case we present demonstrates, careful attention and repetitive evaluations before and after use of flumazenil may be needed in benzodiazepine overdose because resedation occurs in approximately 30% of total flumazenil-treated cases, which suggests that the risk of aspiration or incidental death after administrating flumazenil might be significant without careful monitoring.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908447","annotations":[{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Unconsciousness","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.476651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Flumazenil","weight":0.395556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.359946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine overdose","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_overdose"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"}]}
