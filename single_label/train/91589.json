{"id":91589,"title":"[Analysis of diagnosis and treatment of Segond fracture].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical characteristics of Segond fracture and its operative method and opportunity.From June 2008 to December 2011, arthroscopic exploration was performed in 16 patients with Segond fracture. Six patients were explored at 1 week after injury ,their anterior cruciate ligament were broken completely combined with meniscus injury. Ten patients were explored at 8-10 weeks after injury, 4 patients with anterior and posterior cruciate ligament breakage completely, 4 patients with anterior cruciate ligament breakage completely,and 2 patients with anterior cruciate ligament breakage incompletely,among 10 cases, 8 cases of anterior cruciate ligament breakage completely combined with meniscus injury, 1 case of anterior cruciate ligament breakage incompletely without obviously meniscus injury, 1 case combined with fibular head fracture and lateral collateral ligament injury. All broken cruciate ligaments were rebuilt after arthroscopic exploration and meniscus injuries were sutured in 5 cases. Clinical effects were evaluated according to Lysholm-Gillquist scoring of knee joint function.Six patients were operated at 1 week after injury,their knee joint swelled obviously at 3 days after operation,unloaded blood oozing by joint puncture,and out-of-bed activity with assistance at the I week after operation. Other 10 patients were operated at 8-10 weeks after injury,no knee joint obviously swelled,no blood oozing was found by joint puncture ,and out-of-bed activity with assistance at 3 days after operation. All patients were followed up from 12 to 50 months with an average of 24 months. Postoperative Lysholm-Gillquist scoring of all patients were higher than preoperative and recovered well.Segond fractures often associated with anterior cruciate ligament breakage and meniscus injury,it is important that early detection for treatment. The best time of cruciate ligament rebuilding and meniscus repairing may be at 8-10 weeks after injury.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490537","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Fibular collateral ligament","weight":0.872991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibular_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Posterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.829174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.665589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Segond fracture","weight":0.632117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segond_fracture"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.559399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0713112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Tear of meniscus","weight":0.0585202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_of_meniscus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
