{"id":45419,"title":"Observations on the Ministry of Public Health program of support to the hospitalization of patients in Lebanon.","abstract":"Lebanon has a highly fragmented health care system. The Lebanese population receives its health care services through a system dominated by the private sector that is dependent to a large extent on public sector financing. Lebanon spends about 83% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health. This study consists of observations on the utilization of the Ministry of Public Health (MOH) program of hospital care provision. The study population included all patients admitted for hospitalization in any of the 126 hospitals contracted with the MOH, between August 2008 and July 2009 (one full year). This review is limited to medical admissions only. The surgical admissions have been excluded since they are covered under a 'flat fee' reimbursement. Findings reveal that a significant proportion of the hospital admissions under this program are for conditions that may not need hospitalization. Moreover, most of these admissions receive care in relatively small and peripheral hospitals. The findings ought to lead to a further scrutiny of the ministry program of support to the hospitalization of its nationals. Measures may be indicated to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital utilization, avoid waste and possibly fraud, and reconsider the role of small and peripheral hospitals within the health care system of the country.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684124","annotations":[{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Public sector","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Private sector","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.621341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.522839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Fraud","weight":0.473099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Lebanon","weight":0.361252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.191974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Fee","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee"},{"name":"Ministry of Health (Singapore)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore)"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Apartment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Reimbursement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reimbursement"}]}
