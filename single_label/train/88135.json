{"id":88135,"title":"Development of a safety decision-making scenario to measure worker safety in agriculture.","abstract":"Human factors play an important role in the management of occupational safety, especially in high-hazard workplaces such as commercial grain-handling facilities. Employee decision-making patterns represent an essential component of the safety system within a work environment. This research describes the process used to create a safety decision-making scenario to measure the process that grain-handling employees used to make choices in a safety-related work task. A sample of 160 employees completed safety decision-making simulations based on a hypothetical but realistic scenario in a grain-handling environment. Their choices and the information they used to make their choices were recorded. Although the employees emphasized safety information in their decision-making process, not all of their choices were safe choices. Factors influencing their choices are discussed, and implications for industry, management, and workers are shared.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897917","annotations":[{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.764943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.679408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.614156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.334188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.33271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Human factors","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.150941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Realism (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
