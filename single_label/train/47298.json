{"id":47298,"title":"Serrated neoplasia of the colon: what do we really know?","abstract":"Colonoscopy offers incomplete protection from colorectal cancer, particularly in the right colon. Part of this inadequacy may be related to serrated neoplasia. Serrated polyps of the colorectum are now understood to be a heterogeneous group of polyps, some of which are cancer precursors, such as the sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) and the traditional serrated adenoma (TSA). In contrast to conventional adenomas, there is limited published literature on the epidemiology and natural history of these lesions. Furthermore, existing guidelines regarding screening and surveillance practices for these polyps are based largely on expert opinion without firm evidence. In this review, we describe the current understanding of the molecular biology, histopathology, and endoscopic features of serrated neoplasia of the colorectum, with an emphasis on aspects relevant to the practicing gastroenterologist.
