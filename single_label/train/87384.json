{"id":87384,"title":"Plating of open pediatric tibia fractures.","abstract":"This study is a single center retrospective chart and radiographic review of patients with open tibia fractures under the age of 16 years of age over past 10 years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the treatment of open pediatric tibia fractures with plating in regards to time to ambulation, time to union, and deformity in comparison to other treatment options. We found that plating open pediatric tibia fractures is a safe treatment option that can lead to excellent results with low risk of complications.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223152","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.186248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0263423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0180685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"}]}
