{"id":88763,"title":"[Application progress of seed cells in tissue engineered nerve].","abstract":"To summarize the applications of Schwann cells (SCs), stem cells, and genetically modified cells (GMCs) in repair of peripheral nerve defects.The literature of original experimental study and clinical research related with SCs, stem cells, and GMCs was reviewed and analyzed.SCs play a key role in repair of peripheral nerve defects; the stem cells can be induced to differentiate into SCs, which can be implanted into nerve conduits to promote the repair of peripheral nerve defect; genetically modified technology can enhance the function of SCs and different stem cells, which has been regarded as a new option for tissue engineered nerve.Although great progress has been made in tissue engineered nerve recently, mostly limited to the experimental stage. The research of seed cells in application of tissue engineered nerve need be studied deeply.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796188","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.515856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Schwann cell","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwann_cell"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.270049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.236367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Theodor Schwann","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Schwann"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_castes_and_scheduled_tribes"},{"name":"Investigational product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigational_product"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"GMC (automobile)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC_(automobile)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
