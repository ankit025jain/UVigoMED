{"id":35899,"title":"Vascular malformations of the orbit: classification and the role of imaging in diagnosis and treatment strategies*.","abstract":"To describe the authors' experience with orbital vascular malformations using the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification and the preferred radiologic techniques.Review of clinical and radiologic experience from 1976 to 2012. This article presents the findings from several studies conducted on vascular malformations of the orbit, all of which received institutional review board approval when needed.The orbital vascular malformations can be evaluated, classified, and managed according to the ISSVA classification to provide a common language of communication between specialties, which takes into account flow dynamics.The ISSVA can be applied for vascular malformations of the orbit.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614543","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.494375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.265789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.25402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.137345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0965103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Natural language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anomalies (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalies_(album)"}]}
