{"id":63422,"title":"Simultaneous occurrence of chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: report of an unusual case.","abstract":"The coexistence of chronic myeloid leukaemia(CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL) has been reported occasionally in literature, with only seven cases of simultaneous occurrence of these two diseases. We present here a case of 57 yr male patient where a complete blood count and differential done using volume conductivity scatter (VCS) technology suggested a diagnosis of CML with CLL. It was further confirmed by immunophneotyping and cytogenetic analysis. The patient was started on tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 400 mg once daily. Four months after the treatment, patient is doing fine with a count of 22 Ã— 10 9 /L and 64% lymphocytes.
