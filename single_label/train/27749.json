{"id":27749,"title":"[Role of alteration in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in the development of drug dependence].","abstract":"Ca2+ influx into neuron through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) plays an important role in psychostimulant-induced behaviroal and neuronal plasticity. On the other hand, Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum is one mechanism altering the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Little is known about functional relationship between psychological dependence due to drugs of abuse and L-type VDCCs or ryanodine receptors. In this paper, we review the roles and regulatory mechanisms of intracellular Ca2+ channels, especially L-type VDCCs and ryanodine receptors in brain of animals with drug dependence. Our recent study have reported that blockade of L-type VDCCs inhibits the development of rewarding effects on drugs of abuse (methamphetamine, cocaine and morphine), suggesting that up-regulation of L-type VDCCs (alpha 1C and alpha 1D subunits) occurs during the development of psychological dependence. Moreover, the critical expression of type-1 and -2 ryanodine receptors in the development of methamphetamine- and cocaine-induced rewarding effects are regulated by dopamine D1 receptors. These results suggest that changes in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics play an essential role in the development of drug dependence.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223085","annotations":[{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.814882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D1","weight":0.752008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D1"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.695057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Voltage-dependent calcium channel","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.264585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Ryanodine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanodine"},{"name":"5-HT1D receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1D_receptor"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Alpha (ethology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"}]}
