{"id":62776,"title":"Donor selection for killer immunoglobulin-like receptors B haplotype of the centromeric motifs can improve the outcome after HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity in HLA cells of recipients is regulated by killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on donor NK cells. The effect of KIRs on HSCT outcomes is controversial, particularly in those undergoing HLA-identical sibling HSCT. In this study, effects of KIR and HLA genotypes on the HSCT outcome were investigated in a 5-year retrospective study comprising 219 patient-donor pairs undergoing HLA-identical sibling HSCT for myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. We found that 39.7% (87 of 219) of these pairs, which were KIR mismatched, had better overall survival (OS) and reduced grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), especially in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Bx1 donor KIR genotype with haplotype B on a telomeric region was a risk factor for the OS and relapse-free survival (RFS). Donor centromeric (c) and telomeric (t) KIR haplotype analysis showed that donor KIR cB-tA/tB was associated with improved OS and RFS compared with cA-tA or cA-tB. Furthermore, donor KIR B haplotype of the centromeric motifs (Cen-B) was an independent beneficial factor in improving OS and RFS and in protecting from relapse after HSCT. In AML patients, the occurrence of aGVHD was significantly lower in HLA-C1 group compared with that in HLA-C2 group, although such effect was not observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia. Our results suggest that KIR could impact outcome and donor KIR haplotype with Cen-B confer significant survival benefits to HLA-identical sibling HSCT.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516895","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.815563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.793857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.750948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.61283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.595153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.594757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.357569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.328343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.310685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Stem cell controversy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_controversy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"}]}
