{"id":65868,"title":"Quantification of enhancement of renal parenchymal masses with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of quantitative assessment of enhancement in diagnosing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). A total of 73 solid renal parenchymal masses underwent both conventional ultrasound and CEUS. We compared the difference in maximum diameters on conventional ultrasound and CEUS between the benign and malignant groups. Enhancement features derived from a time-intensity curve were also analyzed. The diameters of renal cancer were found to be larger on CEUS than on conventional ultrasound (p < 0.05). When cutoff values of 4.74 s for washout time and 8.52% for enhancement intensity at 60 s for diagnosing RCCs were applied, the sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 67.3%, 95.2%, 86.5% and 65.4%, 81.0%, 68.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for these two enhancement characteristics combined as a criterion for differentiating RCCs from benign lesions were 44.0% and 99.1%, respectively. Early washout in the area of maximal intensity in the interior of the lesion and prolonged washout in the whole area of the lesion are specific CEUS manifestations suggestive of RCC.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768490","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Mass (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(music)"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Washout (aviation)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washout_(aviation)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
