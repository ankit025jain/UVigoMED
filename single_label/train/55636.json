{"id":55636,"title":"Comparison of exudative age-related macular degeneration subtypes in Japanese and French Patients: multicenter diagnosis with multimodal imaging.","abstract":"To compare and analyze differences and similarities between Japanese and French patients in subtype diagnosis of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as determined by fundus photography (FP) and fluorescein angiography (FA), and a multimodal imaging involving FP, FA, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT).Retrospective chart review.We determined the subtype diagnosis for 99 consecutive Japanese eyes and 94 consecutive French eyes with exudative AMD. The first-step diagnosis was made using FP and FA, while the second-step diagnosis was made using FP, FA/ICGA, and OCT. The diagnoses made by Japanese and French physicians were compared, and when the diagnoses differed, a third institute was consulted to arrive at a final consensus and diagnosis.The first-step diagnosis showed 20%-30% disagreement against the final diagnosis, but the second-step diagnosis showed only 10% disagreement. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) was observed more in Japanese patients (48%) than in French (9%), and the rate of PCV with type 1 or 2 choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was extremely low: 3% in Japanese and 0% in French. Type 1 CNV was found significantly more in French cases (53.3% vs 35.1%, P=.018), while the rate of eyes with type 2 CNV only or chorioretinal anastomosis was similar between populations.Multimodality imaging significantly improved the sub-classification of AMD. There were significant differences between the 2 series in the proportions of type 1 CNV and PCV, while the proportions of type 2 CNV only and chorioretinal anastomosis were similar between groups.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844973","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.890754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.79052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.762764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.669276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.63592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.522138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.396535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.361188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christelijk_Nationaal_Vakverbond"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Institute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}]}
