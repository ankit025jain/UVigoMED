{"id":82678,"title":"Successful treatment of oral verrucous hyperplasia with photodynamic therapy combined with cryotherapy--report of 3 cases.","abstract":"Our previous study showed successful treatment of a large oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH) with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy combined with cryotherapy (ALA-PDT). In this case series, we extended this combined method for another three OVH lesions in three different patients. The clinical procedure was conducted as follows: the OVH lesions were irradiated with a 635-nm laser 1.5h after topical application of 20% ALA on the lesion for a total of 1000 s, which consisted of five 3-min and one 100-s irradiations separated by five 3-min rests. Cryogun cryotherapy was then performed on the lesion after ALA-PDT. The tumor was cleared after 1-6 treatments. No recurrence of the lesion was found after a follow-up period of 6-24 months. We suggest that our combined treatment protocol may be effective in treating OVH lesions.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561304","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.667324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.476337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.474817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.231296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"635","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/635"},{"name":"624","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624"},{"name":"Centenarian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenarian"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"American Library Association","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Library_Association"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
