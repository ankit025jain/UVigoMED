{"id":88528,"title":"Determination of visual prognosis in children with open globe injuries.","abstract":"To determine the predictive factors of visual outcomes in children with open globe injury and to give guidance to reduce the incidence of open globe injury.One hundred and forty eyes of 137 consecutive open globe injury patients, who were treated at the Eye Center of Second Bethune Hospital affiliated with Jilin University between August 2005 and August 2012, were retrospectively analyzed. Data recorded included demographic characteristics, causes of injury, location and extent of injury, presenting visual acuity, detailed ocular anterior and posterior segment evaluations, details of primary and subsequent surgeries, and postoperative complications and outcomes. The follow-up data included the most recent best-corrected visual acuity, complications, and the duration of follow-up.Of the 137 patients, there were 116 (84.7%) boys and 21 (15.3%) girls. Their ages ranged between 3 and 17 years old (mean=11.57Â±4.19 years old). Sixty (43.8%) children had a right eye injury, whereas 74 (54.0%) had a left eye injury. Only three (2.2%) children suffered bilateral eye injury. Living utensils, industrial tools, and fireworks contributed to the most common causes of open globe injury. Eighty-one (59.1%) had sharp force injuries, 23 (16.8%) had blunt injuries, and 33 (24.1%) had missile injuries.Unfavorable visual outcomes were related to a younger age at presentation, poor presenting visual acuity, injuries caused by blunt or missile objects, posterior wound location, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, and surgical intervention of pars plana vitrectomy.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833181","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.651658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.565849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.417786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Eye injury","weight":0.143404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_injury"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Jilin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin"},{"name":"Jilin University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin_University"},{"name":"Hyphema","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphema"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.0207178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Missile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Globe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Fireworks","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
