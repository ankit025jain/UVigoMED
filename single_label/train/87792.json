{"id":87792,"title":"The outcome following fixation of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures.","abstract":"Unstable bicondylar tibial plateau fractures are rare and there is little guidance in the literature as to the best form of treatment. We examined the short- to medium-term outcome of this injury in a consecutive series of patients presenting to two trauma centres. Between December 2005 and May 2010, a total of 55 fractures in 54 patients were treated by fixation, 34 with peri-articular locking plates and 21 with limited access direct internal fixation in combination with circular external fixation using a Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF). At a minimum of one year post-operatively, patient-reported outcome measures including the WOMAC index and SF-36 scores showed functional deficits, although there was no significant difference between the two forms of treatment. Despite low outcome scores, patients were generally satisfied with the outcome. We achieved good clinical and radiological outcomes, with low rates of complication. In total, only three patients (5%) had collapse of the joint of > 4 mm, and metaphysis to diaphysis angulation of 75ยบ, and five patients (9%) with displacement of > 4 mm. All patients in our study went on to achieve full union. This study highlights the serious nature of this injury and generally poor patient-reported outcome measures following surgery, despite treatment by experienced surgeons using modern surgical techniques. Our findings suggest that treatment of complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures with either a locking plate or a TSF gives similar clinical and radiological outcomes.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986951","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.671512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.45303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Metaphysis","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.199199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Attachment therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_therapy"},{"name":"Fixation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Wireless telegraphy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Balance of trade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Limited-access road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-access_road"}]}
