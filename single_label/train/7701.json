{"id":7701,"title":"[Primary study on tissue engineered periosteum osteogenesis to repair scapula defect in vivo in allogenic rabbit].","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility of tissue engineered periosteum (TEP) constructed by porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) of rabbit to repair the large irregular bone defects in allogenic rabbits.The BMSCs were cultivated from the bone marrow of New Zealand white rabbits (aged, 2 weeks-1 month). SIS was fabricated by porcine proximal jejunum. The TEP constructed by SIS scaffold and BMSCs was prepared in vitro. Eighteen 6-month-old New Zealand white rabbits whose scapula was incompletely resected to establish one side large irregular bone defects (3 cm x 3 cm) model. The bone defects were repaired with TEP (experimental group, n = 9) and SIS (control group, n = 9), respectively. At 8 weeks after operation, the rabbits were sacrificed, and the implants were harvested. The general condition of the rabbits was observed; X-ray radiography and score according to Lane-Sandhu criteria, and histological examination (HE staining and Masson staining) were performed.After operation, all animals had normal behavior and diet; the incision healed normally. The X-ray results showed new bone formation with normal bone density in the defect area of experimental group; but no bone formation was observed in control group. The X-ray score was 6.67 +/- 0.32 in experimental group and was 0.32 +/- 0.04 in control group, showing significant difference (t = 19.871, P = 0.001). The general observation of the specimens showed bone healing at both ends of the defect, and the defect was filled by new bone in experimental group; no new bone formed in the control group. The histological staining showed new bone tissue where there were a lot of new vessels and medullary cavity, and no macrophages or lymphocytes infiltration was observed in the defect area of experimental group; only some connective tissue was found in the control group.TEP constructed by porcine SIS and BMSCs of rabbit can form new bone in allogenic rabbit and has the feasibility to repair the large irregular bone defects.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal
