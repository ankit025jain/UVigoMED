{"id":37562,"title":"Quality of life measures and psychiatric symptoms in adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus and familial Mediterranean fever.","abstract":"To describe the relation between global Quality of Life (QL) and psychiatric symptoms in adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and to analyze the perceptions of parents and adolescents.This study included 51 adolescents diagnosed with SLE (n=25) and FMF (n=26), and 51 healthy adolescents. The Health Related QL (HRQL) of SLE patients was rated by parents and adolescents using the Simple Measurement of Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters© (SMILEY©). The global QL of FMF patients and healthy adolescents was rated by the response given to the first question of the SMILEY© by each parent and adolescent. All participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which measures psychiatric symptoms.In total, 92.3% with FMF, 56% with SLE and 76.5% of healthy adolescents reported their global QL as good and very good using the first question of the SMILEY©. The global QL perceptions of adolescents and their parents did not correlate (FMF, p=0.94; SLE, p=0.16). SLE patients had the highest rate of depression (54.2%), whereas hostility was detected among 54.9% of healthy adolescents. Significant relations were detected between BSI and SMILEY© scores.The global QL perceptions of adolescents with FMF were better than those of healthy adolescents, which may be explained by their perceived relief of anguish they suffer during their short-lived attacks. The global QL perceptions of adolescents with SLE were the worst, most probably due to the chronic course resulting in an awareness of limitations and intense treatment. Adolescents with SLE had similar psychopathological symptom scores when compared with FMF patients and healthy adolescents. This could be explained by developing resilience. Differences in the perception of adolescents versus their parents regarding global QL emphasized the importance of adolescent-specific interviews for chronic illnesses and multidisciplinary follow-up with adolescent medicine.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486727","annotations":[{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.714127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.691049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.540926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.509722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.499819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.487592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Adolescent medicine","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent_medicine"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.236714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.228977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Familial Mediterranean fever","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_Mediterranean_fever"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Hostility","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostility"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"}]}
