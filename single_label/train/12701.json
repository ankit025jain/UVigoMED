{"id":12701,"title":"A mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion characterizing features of vascular cognitive impairment.","abstract":"Vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment occurs as a result of persistently compromised blood flow to the brain and represents the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. In order to investigate its underlying mechanisms, a mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion has been developed, which involves the narrowing of the bilateral common carotid arteries with newly designed microcoils. This mouse model provides a unique platform to investigate the mechanisms of angiogenesis following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and to explore potential drugs or cell therapies designed to enhance angiogenesis as a preclinical step toward developing novel treatments for dementia of vascular origin.
