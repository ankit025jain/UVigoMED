{"id":62215,"title":"Hyper-coagulable profile with elevated pro-thrombotic biomarkers and increased cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease risk exist among healthy dyslipidemic women.","abstract":"Dyslipidemia is one of the pathognomonic elements of athero-genesis, as well as cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease (CCVD). Hemostatic factors are also involved in athero-sclerosis and ischemic changes, however their relationship with disrupted lipid homeostasis is not well characterized. The aim of this study was to determine the coagulation state of dyslipidemic patients and to evaluate their association with CCVD risk factors. Biochemical and hematological parameters, as well as neuro-psychiatric profile of 109 dyslipidemic subjects and 107 normo-lipidic healthy volunteers were assessed. Serum bio-marker levels and cognitive performance generally did not differ in the groups, but prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and D-dimer concentrations were markedly higher among women. Hyper-coagulability was not associated with dyslipidemia, but was correlated with the female gender, which might pose an increased thromboembolic risk in asymptomatic women.
