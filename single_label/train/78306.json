{"id":78306,"title":"[Hearing impairment and language delay in infants: diagnostic and genetic].","abstract":"This article gives an overview on important aspects of hearing and language development of infants and toddlers. Newborn hearing screening is implemented in Germany for all infants since January 2009. The realization of early postnatal hearing screening is regulated by a publication of the \"Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\". It regulates the measurement method (TEOAE or AABR screening) and differs between healthy and sick newborns. It also rules the timetable of rescreening and if it still fails of paedaudiological follow up. The second part refers to objective and subjective assessment of hearing loss and different important issues of permanent childhood hearing impairment are discussed. Especially CMV infection by materno-fetal transmission and hereditary hearing loss is addressed in comparison to otitis media with effusion. Speech and language development in the first three years of live and the corresponding nomenclature is introduced in the last part. Different parent questionnaires are well established in evaluation of early language acquisition. An early diagnosis of language delay is possible and therapeutic measures can be established to prevent further social and psychological problems.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710780","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.735991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Language acquisition","weight":0.650617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.585409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.490315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.443581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.434864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.2394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Language development","weight":0.224431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_development"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Nomenclature","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Language delay","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_delay"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"}]}
