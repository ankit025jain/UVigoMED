{"id":51174,"title":"Influence of ionizing radiation on ovarian carcinoma SKOV- 3 xenografts in nude mice under hypoxic conditions.","abstract":"We aimed to detect the expression of HIF-1?, VEGF, HPSE-1 and CD31 in SKOV3 xenografts in nude mice treated with different doses of ionizing radiation, trying to explore the possible mechanism of hypoxia and radioresistance.Nude mice bearing SKOV3 xenografts were randomly divided into 4 groups: Group A (control group, no ionizing radiation), Group B (treated with low dose of ionizing radiation: 50cGy), Group C (treated with high dose of ionizing radiation: 300cGy), Group D ( combined ionizing radiation, treated with ionizing radiation from low dose to high dose : 50cGy first and 300cGy after 6h interval). The mRNA levels of HIF-1 and VEGF in each group were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction, while HPSE-1 expression was measured by ELISA. The microvessel density (MVD) and hypoxic cells were determined through immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of CD31 and HIF-1a.Significant differences of HIF-1? mRNA level could be found among the 4 groups (F=74.164, P<0.001): Group C>Group A>Group D> Group B. The mRNA level of VEGF in Group C was significantly higher than in the other three groups (t=-5.267, P=0.000), while no significant difference was observed among Group A, B and D (t=1.528, 1.588; P=0.205, 0.222). In addition, the MVD was shown to be the highest in Group C (t=6.253, P=0.000), whereas the HPSE-1 level in Group A was lower than in Group B (t=14.066, P=0.000) and higher than in Group C (t=-21.919, P=0.000), and similar with Group D (t=-2.066, P=0.058). Through IHC staining of HIF-1a, the expression of hypoxic cells in Group A was (++), Group B was (+), Group C was (+++) and Group D was (+).Ionizing radiation with lower- doses might improve tumor hypoxia through inhibiting the expression of HIF-1 and HPSE-1, whereas higher- doses worsen tumor hypoxic conditions by up-regulating HIF-1?, HPSE-1, VEGF and CD31 levels. A protocol of low-dose ionizing radiation followed by a high-dose irradiation might at least partly improve tumor hypoxia and enhance radiosensitivity.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716983","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.860439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.771442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.712539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.693193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.690704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.562923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.526543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.47269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.32212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.306422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.197123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Tumor hypoxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_hypoxia"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Radiosensitivity","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosensitivity"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypoxia (environmental)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)"},{"name":"Radioresistance","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance"}]}
