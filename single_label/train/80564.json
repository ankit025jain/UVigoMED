{"id":80564,"title":"Impact of mass azithromycin distribution on malaria parasitemia during the low-transmission season in Niger: a cluster-randomized trial.","abstract":"We assessed the effect of mass azithromycin treatment on malaria parasitemia in a trachoma trial in Niger. Twenty-four study communities received treatment during the wet, high-transmission season. Twelve of the 24 communities were randomized to receive an additional treatment during the dry, low-transmission season. Outcome measurements were conducted at the community-level in children < 1-72 months of age in May-June 2011. Parasitemia was higher in the 12 once-treated communities (29.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 21.5-40.0%) than in the 12 twice-treated communities (19.5%, 95% CI = 13.0-26.5%, P = 0.03). Parasite density was higher in once-treated communities (354 parasites/?L, 95% CI = 117-528 parasites/?L) than in twice-treated communities (74 parasites/?L, 95% CI = 41-202 parasites/?L, P = 0.03). Mass distribution of azithromycin reduced malaria parasitemia 4-5 months after the intervention. The results suggest that drugs with antimalaria activity can have long-lasting impacts on malaria during periods of low transmission.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615132","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.321557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.263198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.0574438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Niger","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger"},{"name":"Azithromycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"},{"name":"Trachoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachoma"},{"name":"Parasitemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitemia"},{"name":"Mass distribution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_distribution"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Transmission (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
