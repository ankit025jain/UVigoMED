{"id":91032,"title":"Olfactory function after mild head injury in children.","abstract":"Olfactory impairment has been shown to be linked to head injury. In addition, it is believed that measurement of olfactory function after head trauma represents a sensitive tool for measuring frontal brain damage. Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of mild head trauma in children on olfactory function over a time period of up to 1 year after head trauma. The olfactory function of 114 children who suffered mild head trauma according to the Glasgow Coma Scale was assessed 3 times with an interval of 4 months. In addition, healthy, age-matched controls were tested for comparison of olfactory function. Patients scored significantly lower on the odor threshold test compared to the control group-but still within normal range. Between the 2 groups, no difference was found for suprathreshold testing. Neither olfactory threshold scores nor olfactory discrimination scores changed significantly over the study period of 1 year. This data prove an impact of mild head trauma on olfactory function of children. It seems unlikely that children who suffered mild head trauma will become hyposmic or anosmic.
