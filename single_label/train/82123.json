{"id":82123,"title":"Ridge preservation using demineralized bone matrix gel with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 after tooth extraction: a randomized controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"The aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of injectable demineralized bone matrix (DBM) gel combined with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) on alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction.A total of 69 patients were randomly assigned to either a test group (n = 35) or a control group (n = 34). In the test group, DBM, together with rhBMP-2 (0.05 mg/mL; rhBMP-2/DBM) was transplanted into the extraction sockets. The control group received DBM alone. The safety of rhBMP-2/DBM was evaluated by oral examination, serum chemistry, and hematologic examination. The radiographic changes in alveolar bone height and width were measured using computed tomography scans performed immediately after transplant and again 3 months thereafter.Healing was uneventful in all subjects, with no anticipated adverse events and no clinically significant changes in the serum chemistry and hematologic findings. No meaningful immune response was found among the study groups. No significant difference was found in the radiographic changes of alveolar bone height and width (P > .05).This new injectable biomaterial can be used easily and safely in clinical applications.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709512","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled
