{"id":72037,"title":"[Carotid blowout syndrome treated by parent artery occlusion using pushable coils: a case report].","abstract":"Here we report a case of carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) treated with parent artery occlusion using pushable coils.A 68-year-old man with a history of surgery and chemoradiation therapy for esophageal cancer 9 years prior presented with a massive hemorrhage from a skin defect in the neck. Angiography revealed encasement of the right common carotid artery by radiation necrosis, and CBS was diagnosed. We performed emergent endovascular treatment, and the right common carotid artery was occluded using pushable coils and a detachable coil. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. However, he died of esophageal cancer recurrence 6 months later.Pushable coils were useful for occluding the parent artery in this case of CBS.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006101","annotations":[{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.826203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.74293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.561266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.494809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.40456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"CBS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coil"},{"name":"Detachable chairlift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachable_chairlift"},{"name":"Guglielmi Detachable Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmi_Detachable_Coil"},{"name":"Blowout (well drilling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
