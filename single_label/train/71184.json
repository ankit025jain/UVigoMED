{"id":71184,"title":"LIFR?-CT3 induces differentiation of a human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 by suppressing miR-155 expression through the JAK/STAT pathway.","abstract":"The distal cytoplasmic motifs of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor ?-chain (LIFR?-CT3) and its TAT fusion protein (TAT-CT3) can independently suppress cell viability and induce myeloid differentiation in human leukemia HL-60 cells in our previous studies. But its underlying mechanism remains undefined. Herein, we show that a prokaryotic expressed TAT-CT3 induced a rapid elevation of STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3), and then suppress the transcription of miR-155 and induce the elevation of SOCS-1, which further inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation for a long-term period. Our result indicated a novel mechanism of TAT-CT3 to promote HL60 cells differentiation, which provides some potential therapeutic targets for future acute myelogenous leukemia therapy.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092123","annotations":[{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Leukemia inhibitory factor","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_inhibitory_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Prokaryote","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.722376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.66182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.513105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1","weight":0.409824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor_of_cytokine_signaling_1"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.380798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.309812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.284813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.253016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.235792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
