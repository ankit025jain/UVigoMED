{"id":81626,"title":"Eight-year follow-up of a fixed-detachable maxillary prosthesis utilizing an attachment system: clinical protocol for individuals with skeletal class III malocclusions.","abstract":"The aim of this article is to describe a successful clinical protocol for prosthodontic rehabilitation of a patient with a skeletal Class III malocclusion using a fixed-detachable maxillary prosthesis supported by 6 implants and the MK1 attachment system. The patient was followed up for 8 years. A 46-year-old edentulous woman with a skeletal Class III malocclusion expressed dissatisfaction with her old existing maxillary denture from an esthetic point of view and frustration regarding its function. A fixed-detachable maxillary prosthesis using the MK1 attachment system was made. The patient was followed up clinically and radiographically for 8 years. No bone loss, fracture of prosthetic components, or fracture of the prosthesis was detected in that period. A fixed detachable maxillary prosthesis using the MK1 attachment system is a treatment option for patients with Class III malocclusions who opt not to undergo orthognathic surgery.
