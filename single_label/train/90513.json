{"id":90513,"title":"Five-year clinical and radiological results of combined anteroposterior stabilization of thoracolumbar fractures.","abstract":"Despite promising early clinical results, the long-term outcome of the use of expandable titanium cages to reconstruct the anterior column after traumatic burst fractures is still unknown. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of the use of expandable titanium cages 5 years postoperatively.Eighty patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures (T4-L5) underwent posterior stabilization followed by anterior corpectomy and reconstruction using expandable titanium cages with or without additional anterior plating. After 5 years, fusion was evaluated by means of plain radiographs and CT scans, and the patients' scores on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), their neurological status, and clinical results were assessed.Forty-five (56%) of the 80 patients could be examined after 5 years. There was a relatively high rate of complications related to thoracotomy (26%), but there were no complications directly related to the cages. Revision surgery was required in 1 case. The average postoperative loss of correction was only 2.4Â° due to minimal subsidence of the cages. No cage showed a radiolucent line or instability in flexion-extension views. Bony fusion, as assessed by CT scan, was achieved in 41 patients (91%). On clinical examination, 96% of all patients were ambulatory and showed minimal restriction of spinal range of motion; 71% did not need analgesic medication at all; and 67% were able to work. The average ODI score was 12. Thirty-one percent of patients complained of some kind of anterior approach-related complications.Combined anteroposterior stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures with expandable titanium cages is a relative safe procedure with satisfactory radiological and clinical long-term outcome. High fusion rates can be achieved, with only minor loss of correction, typically occurring in the 1st year. However, open thoracotomy carries the risks of additional complications and development of post-thoracotomy syndrome.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and
