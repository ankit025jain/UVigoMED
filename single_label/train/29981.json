{"id":29981,"title":"Cytotoxicity of binary mixtures of human pharmaceuticals in a fish cell line: approaches for non-monotonic concentration-response relationships.","abstract":"Predicting the effects of mixtures of environmental micropollutants is a priority research area. In this study, the cytotoxicity of ten pharmaceuticals to the rainbow trout cell line RTG-2 was determined using the neutral red uptake assay. Fluoxetine (FL), propranolol (PPN), and diclofenac (DCF) were selected for further study as binary mixtures. Biphasic concentration-response relationships were observed in cells exposed to FL and PPN. In the case of PPN, microscopic examination revealed lysosomal swelling indicative of direct uptake and accumulation of the compound. Three equations describing non-monotonic concentration-response relationships were evaluated and one was found to consistently provide more accurate estimates of the median and 10% effect concentrations compared with a sigmoidal concentration-response model. Predictive modeling of the effects of binary mixtures of FL, PPN, and DCF was undertaken using an implementation of the concentration addition (CA) conceptual model incorporating non-monotonic concentration-response relationships. The cytotoxicity of the all three binary combinations could be adequately predicted using CA, suggesting that the toxic mode of action in RTG-2 cells is unrelated to the therapeutic mode of action of these compounds. The approach presented here is widely applicable to the study of mixture toxicity in cases where non-monotonic concentration-response relationships are observed.
