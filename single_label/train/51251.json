{"id":51251,"title":"Comparison of effects of gliclazide, metformin and pioglitazone monotherapies on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with newly diagnosed uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of gliclazide-modified release (gliclazide-MR), metformine (MET) and pioglitazone (PIO) monotherapies on glycemic control and conventional/non-conventional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A single center, randomized, 52-wk comparator-controlled clinical study was carried out in patients with newly diagnosed uncontrolled T2DM. A total of 57 patients were randomized into gliclazide-MR, metformin and pioglitazone groups. Drugs were administered for 12 months. Anthropometric measurements, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, lipid parameters, the markers of coagulation/fibrinolysis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction were measured at baseline and at months 3, 6, and 12.In the gliclazide-MR group, HC, FPG, HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, TC, trigylcerides, Lp (a), E-selectin and Hcy were significantly decreased after treatment compared to baseline. In the MET group, BMI, WC, FPG, PPG, HbA1c, ICAM-1 and Hcy significantly decreased after treatment compared to baseline. In PIO group, WC, HC, FPG, PPG, HbA1c, C-peptid, HOMA-IR, trigylcerides, vWF, IL-6, ICAM-1, E-selectin and Hcy significantly decreased after treatment compared to baseline, whereas, HDL-C increased. At the end of the month 12, the decreases in insulin and HOMA-IR score were more pronounced with PIO compared to gliclazide.Gliclazide-MR, MET and PIO monotherapies, were equally effective in proving glycemic control in patients with newly diagnosed, oral antidiabetic (OAD)-naive T2DM. But, improvements in conventional/non-conventional cardiovascular risk factors were more pronounced in patients on PIO therapy compared to gliclazide and MET therapies. Also, all of the 3 drugs represent effective and safe first-line pharmacological treatment options in these patients.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710641","annotations":[{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Pioglitazone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioglitazone"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.851187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Gliclazide","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliclazide"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.799097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.775224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.633007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.305451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.170212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Von Willebrand factor","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
