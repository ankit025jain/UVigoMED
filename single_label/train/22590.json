{"id":22590,"title":"Central vascular catheter infections in a Hospital of Central Italy.","abstract":"The insertion and the permanence of central venous catheters (CVC) represent potential sources of infection contracted in hospital. The evaluation of the risk of CVC-associated infections was evaluated in a retrospective study during the period 2007-2010 in a Hospital of Central Italy. A total of 514 CVC were collected and examined by microbiological techniques and, among the examined patients, 450 CVC blood cultures were collected. Cultures were performed collecting a portion of 5-6 cm of intravenous catheters in liquid medium and spread on selective media for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts; blood specimens were obtained through peripheral venous punctures and analyzed by a commercial automated system. 308/514 (59.90%) samples were positive to the microbiological culture. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and other coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) were the prevalent Gram-positive bacteria. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae were the main bacteria isolated. A higher prevalence of Gram-positive bacteria was observed in Neonatal Pathology (90.90%). The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) showed 73.10% of positive cultures with 54.12% of Gram-positive isolates. Among positive blood cultures (38%), Gram-positive bacteria were the main bacteria isolated. The high prevalence of catheter-related infections requires accurate surveillance and the assumption of preventive measures in particular during catheter insertion.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531170","annotations":[{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.780195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.72438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.723005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.691373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.608277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.523993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.409834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Staphylococcus epidermidis","weight":0.386382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_epidermidis"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Coagulase","weight":0.191559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulase"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Central Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"}]}
