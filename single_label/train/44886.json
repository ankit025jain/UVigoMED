{"id":44886,"title":"Coeliac disease in an adult presenting as intussusception without a lead point.","abstract":"A case of adult intussusception is presented in which previously undiagnosed coeliac disease was the cause. The diagnosis was made following microscopic examination of a resected segment of small intestine containing multiple intussusception sites. Adult intussusception is rare and in most cases associated with a 'lead point' lesion, often a tumour. As illustrated here, intussusception without a lead point in the adult patient may be the presenting sign of coeliac disease. Recognition of such may allow correct diagnosis and thus prevent unnecessary surgery.
