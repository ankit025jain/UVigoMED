{"id":73923,"title":"Prognosis in human glioblastoma based on expression of ligand growth hormone-releasing hormone, pituitary-type growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor, its splicing variant receptors, EGF receptor and PTEN genes.","abstract":"Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent brain tumor. Despite recent improvement in therapeutic strategies, the prognosis of GB remains poor. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) may act as a growth factor; antagonists of GHRH have been successfully applied for experimental treatment of different types of tumors. The expression profile of GHRH receptor, its main splice variant SV1 and GHRH have not been investigated in human GB tissue samples.We examined the expression of GHRH, full-length pituitary-type GHRH receptor (pGHRHR), its functional splice variant SV1 and non-functional SV2 by RT-PCR in 23 human GB specimens. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) expression levels were also evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Correlations between clinico-pathological parameters and gene expressions were analyzed.Expression of GHRH was found to be positive in 61.9 % of samples. pGHRH receptor was not expressed in our sample set, while SV1 could be detected in 17.4 % and SV2 in 8.6 % of the GB tissues. In 65.2 and 78.3 % of samples, significant EGFR over-expression or PTEN under-representation could be detected, respectively. In 47.8 % of cases, EGFR up-regulation and PTEN down-regulation occurred together. Survival was significantly poorer in tumors lacking GHRH expression. This worse prognosis in GHRH negative group remained significant even if SV1 was also expressed.Our study shows that GHRH and SV1 genes expressed in human GB samples and their expression patterns are associated with poorer prognosis.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878932","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.865385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Alternative splicing","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Hormone receptor","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.505879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.492151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sarin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin"},{"name":"TNS1","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNS1"},{"name":"Growth hormone releasing hormone","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
