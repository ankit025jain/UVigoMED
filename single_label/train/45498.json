{"id":45498,"title":"Feasibility of a combined percutaneous laparoscopic three-millimeter device.","abstract":"Needlescopic 3-mm instruments induce minimal trauma and produce excellent cosmetic results. A combination of a 3-mm abdominal wall incision and a 5-mm instrument in the abdominal cavity would combine the beneficial features of these two different sizes.The Percutaneous Surgical System (PSS) (Ethicon EndoSurgery, Galway, Ireland) is a new instrument consisting of a 3-mm shaft that is introduced percutaneously into the abdominal cavity. Through a 5-mm trocar, a loader with a 5-mm attachment such as a Maryland dissector is introduced. The attachment is connected to the shaft, and the loader is removed from the abdomen. The feasibility of this device was evaluated retrospectively in 3 Swedish hospitals between January and September 2012.Twenty-eight patients were laparoscopically operated on (cholecystectomy, gastric bypass, fundoplication, incisional hernias, and totally extraperitoneal repair for inguinal hernia) by use of 1 or 2 PSSs in each operation (47 in total). It was feasible to use the PSS in all procedures except during the totally extraperitoneal repair procedure because of the limited available preperitoneal space. Especially in laparoscopic cholecystectomies, the two lateral 5-mm trocars were easily replaced by two 3-mm PSS instruments.The use of the PSS is feasible in a number of laparoscopic procedures, where it can replace 5-mm trocars. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the future role of the PSS versus, for example, needlescopic laparoscopy.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680141","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Trocar","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocar"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.65048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.638098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.610474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.515099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Nissen fundoplication","weight":0.355085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissen_fundoplication"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.283021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.216595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Maryland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
