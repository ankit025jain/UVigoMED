{"id":86278,"title":"TaqMan based real time PCR assay targeting EML4-ALK fusion transcripts in NSCLC.","abstract":"Lung cancer with the ALK rearrangement constitutes only a small fraction of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, in the era of molecular-targeted therapy, efficient patient selection is crucial for successful treatment. In this context, an effective method for EML4-ALK detection is necessary. We developed a new highly sensitive variant specific TaqMan based real time PCR assay applicable to RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE).This assay was used to analyze the EML4-ALK gene in 96 non-selected NSCLC specimens and compared with two other methods (end-point PCR and break-apart FISH).EML4-ALK was detected in 33/96 (34%) specimens using variant specific real time PCR, whereas in only 23/96 (24%) using end-point PCR. All real time PCR positive samples were confirmed with direct sequencing. A total of 46 specimens were subsequently analyzed by all three detection methods. Using variant specific real time PCR we identified EML4-ALK transcript in 17/46 (37%) specimens, using end-point PCR in 13/46 (28%) specimens and positive ALK rearrangement by FISH was detected in 8/46 (17.4%) specimens. Moreover, using variant specific real time PCR, 5 specimens showed more than one EML4-ALK variant simultaneously (in 2 cases the variants 1+3a+3b, in 2 specimens the variants 1+3a and in 1 specimen the variant 1+3b). In one case of 96 EML4-ALK fusion gene and EGFR mutation were detected. All simultaneous genetic variants were confirmed using end-point PCR and direct sequencing.Our variant specific real time PCR assay is highly sensitive, fast, financially acceptable, applicable to FFPE and seems to be a valuable tool for the rapid prescreening of NSCLC patients in clinical practice, so, that most patients able to benefit from targeted therapy could be identified.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792336","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.881188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.647868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.612922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.403229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.296248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"EML4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EML4"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"846","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/846"},{"name":"1746","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1746"},{"name":"1346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1346"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Methods of detecting extrasolar planets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
