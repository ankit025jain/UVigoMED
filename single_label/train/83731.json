{"id":83731,"title":"Current situation of transvaginal mesh repair for pelvic organ prolapse.","abstract":"Surgical mesh is a metallic or polymeric screen intended to be implanted to reinforce soft tissue or bone where weakness exists. Surgical mesh has been used since the 1950s to repair abdominal hernias. In the 1970s, gynecologists began using surgical mesh products to indicate the repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP), and in the 1990s, gynecologists began using surgical mesh for POP. Then the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first surgical mesh product specifically for use in POP. Surgical mesh materials can be divided into several categories. Most surgical mesh devices cleared for POP procedures are composed of non-absorbable synthetic polypropylene. Mesh can be placed in the anterior vaginal wall to aid in the correction of cystocele (anterior repair), in the posterior vaginal wall to aid in correction of rectocele (posterior repair), or attached to the top of the vagina to correct uterine prolapse or vaginal apical prolapse (apical repair). Over the past decades, surgical mesh products for transvaginal POP repair became incorporated into \"kits\" that included tools to aid in the delivery and insertion of the mesh. Surgical mesh kits continue to evolve, adding new insertion tools, tissue fixation anchors, surgical techniques, and ab- sorbable and biological materials. This procedure has been performed popularly. It was also performed increased in China. But this new technique met some trouble recently and let shake in urogynecology.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264889","annotations":[{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.851443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.738209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.732642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"China","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.523648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.326841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.317447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.262061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.185865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.179718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Rectocele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectocele"},{"name":"Cystocele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystocele"},{"name":"Uterine prolapse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_prolapse"},{"name":"Urogynecology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urogynecology"},{"name":"Shilling","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling"},{"name":"1970s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"1950","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"1950s","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
