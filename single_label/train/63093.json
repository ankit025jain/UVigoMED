{"id":63093,"title":"Phase I study of nedaplatin prior to S-1 in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"We previously reported on the regimen of S-1 plus nedaplatin (NDP), with S-1 was administered orally for 14 days and NDP intravenously on day 8. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NDP was determined to be 90 mg/m². The main toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. This result was tolerated, but we believe there is a more effective and tolerable regimen. Thus, we investigated the S-1 regimen administered orally for 14 days, and NDP intravenously on day 1 in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Oral administration of S-1 (days 1-14) and intravenous NDP (day 1) were tested for patients with advance head and neck cancer in a phase I setting. The dose of S-1 was fixed and the dose of NDP was escalated from 70 mg/m², with an increase of 10 mg/m² per step, to find the MTD.A total of 15 patients were registered. The MTD of NDP was determined to be 100 mg/m². The main toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The response rate (RR) was 57.1%.The recommended dose of NDP for a phase II study was determined to be 100 mg/m². We concluded that our regimen was well tolerated and that the RR was acceptable.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480865","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.81888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.705716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.381689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Maximum tolerated dose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_tolerated_dose"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0153745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"}]}
