{"id":79841,"title":"Topical ivermectin versus crotamiton cream 10% for the treatment of scabies.","abstract":"Scabies, known colloquially as the 7-year itch, is a contagious skin infection that occurs among humans and other animals. The treatment of choice is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical ivermectin vs. crotamiton cream 10% for the treatment of scabies. In total, 340 patients with scabies were enrolled, and randomized into two groups. The first group received 1% ivermectin applied topically to the affected skin. The dose employed was 400 ?g/kg, repeated once the following week, and the second group received crotamiton 10% cream and were told to apply this twice daily for five consecutive days. Treatment was evaluated at intervals of two and four weeks, and if there was treatment failure at the 2-week follow-up, treatment was repeated. Two applications of topical ivermectin provided a cure rate of 64.7% at the 2-week follow-up, which increased to 82.3% at the 4-week follow-up after repeating the treatment. Treatment with single applications of crotamiton cream 10% was effective in 41.2% of patients at the 2-week follow-up, which increased to 64.7% at the 4-week follow-up after this treatment was repeated. Ivermectin was quite safe in our cases. Two applications of ivermectin were as effective as single applications of crotamiton 10% cream at the 2-week follow-up. After repeating the treatment, ivermectin was superior to crotamiton cream 10% at the 4-week follow-up.
