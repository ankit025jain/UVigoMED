{"id":92672,"title":"Increased burden of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer in young women.","abstract":"A higher and increasing incidence of skin cancer has been noted in younger women as compared with men.To assess the relative gender burden of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma in various age groups, particularly in young adult women.A total of 16,994 biopsy-proven skin cancers in 9,376 patients in a single private dermatologic surgery practice was included in this study.Men constituted the majority (63.7%, p < .0001) of patients, accounting for 68.7% of squamous cell carcinomas (p < .0001), 60.8% of basal cell carcinomas (p < .0001), and 57.5% of malignant melanomas (p < .0001). However, a statistically significant majority of melanomas (67.3%, p < .0001) and basal cell carcinomas (60.4%, p < .0001) were seen in women in patients aged 10 to 49 years. There was also a statistically significant increase in the female representation in patients aged 10 to 49 years as compared with those aged 50 to 99 years with respect to squamous cell carcinoma.Women comprise a statistically significant majority of patients with melanoma and basal cell carcinoma in the younger (10-49 years) age groups. This raises a concern regarding an increased future incidence of skin cancer in this population group and a demographic shift to increased female representation among patients with skin cancer.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25357173","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Basal-cell carcinoma","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.530112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.409985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
