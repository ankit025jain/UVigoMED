{"id":81646,"title":"Should occlusal splints be a routine prescription for diagnosed bruxers undergoing implant therapy?","abstract":"Despite the documented excellent clinical performance of dental implants, concerns linger regarding the best way to protect the restored dentition in patients with bruxism. This is because of the risk of occlusal overload that is reported to cause biological and biomechanical failures in the implant-prosthesis system. To better distribute occlusal loads to the rigid components of the prosthesis and to the interface between bone and implant during parafunctional movements, several dentists prescribe acrylic resin occlusal splints for nocturnal use by patients considered at risk. However, it is unclear whether this recommendation is based on scientific evidence or expert clinical opinion. This report reflects our effort to employ the systematic review protocol to assess whether there is scientific evidence to recommend an occlusal splint in bruxers after implant therapy.
