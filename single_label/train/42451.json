{"id":42451,"title":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among visitors to a hepatitis awareness programme.","abstract":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common liver disease worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD among the visitors screened on World Hepatitis Day 2010 and 2011.Attendees of the hepatitis awareness programme (n = 928) were offered screening to rule out liver ailments. The participants were evaluated on history, body mass index (BMI) measurement, blood tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and abdominal ultrasound (US).On ultrasonography, fatty liver was present in 142 of 806 subjects who were found negative for viral serology and had no history of regular alcohol intake. This accounted for 15.3% of all the visitors. Comparing them with the rest of the serology-negative alcohol-negative subjects, there were more housewives (p = 0.005) with fatty liver. They were older with mean age 43.3 +/- 12.1 years compared to 33.1 +/- 16.1 years (p = 0.000) in patients without fatty liver and had a higher BMI 28.6 +/- 6.0 kg/m2 vs. 22.2 +/- 5.3 kg/m2 (p = 0.000). Regression analysis suggested BMI as the only significant independent risk factor (p = 0.000). However, 32 subjects with fatty liver had BMI < 25 kg/m2 and 6 of them had diabetes mellitus. Thirty-one subjects (21.8%) with fatty liver had raised ALT level (p = 0.000) and possible non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which accounts for 3.34% (31/928) of the total visitors.This analysis reveals that our general population is at risk of having NAFLD and NASH and these should be looked into even in non-obese persons.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851524","annotations":[{"name":"World Hepatitis Day","weight":0.954722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Hepatitis_Day"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.846737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.750877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.582073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
