{"id":42389,"title":"[Expression and significance of c-Jun activation domain binding protein 1 in human colorectal carcinoma].","abstract":"To explore the association of Jab1 (c-Jun activation domain binding protein 1) expression during carcinogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) .Tissue specimens were obtained from 80 cases of CRC from January 2007 to December 2008. And the expression of Jab1 protein for each specimen was detected by immunohistochemistry (EnVision). Six representative paired samples of cancerous and paired adjacent normal tissues were collected for Western blot. The relationships between the expression level of Jab1 protein and the clinicopathological characteristics of primary CRC were retrospectively analyzed.A high-level expression of Jab1 was present in cancerous tissues but not in paired adjacent normal tissues. The positive expression rate of Jab1 protein was as high as 96.3% (77/80) . And its high expression rate was 82.5% (66/80) , low expression rate 17.5% (14/80) and 8.8% (7/80) in cancerous and paired adjacent normal tissues respectively (P < 0.05) . Its expression was correlated with differentiation, invasion depth, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.05) . Jab1 was significantly correlated with Ki-67 (r = 0.548, P < 0.01) and inversely with p27(kip1) (r = -0.461, P < 0.01).An over-expression of Jab1 protein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of CRC. Thus it may become a novel diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target in patients with CRC.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854908","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.805343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.76635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.761851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.565351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.521606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.403118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.160085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"CDKN1B","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1B"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
