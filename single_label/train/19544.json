{"id":19544,"title":"Validation of sepsis screening tool using StO2 in emergency department patients.","abstract":"Sepsis is a deleterious systemic response to an infection with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality, affecting more than a million patients a year in the US. The purpose of this study was to develop a screening tool for the early identification of sepsis in emergency department patients using readily available information at triage.This prospective, observational study took place at an academic tertiary referral hospital. Over a period of 10 wk, all patients who were seen at triage were screened for study enrollment. Inclusion criteria were adult (age?18 y) nontrauma patients and exclusion criteria were prisoners and pregnant women. Using a Spot Check StO2 device to measure StO2 value, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature, these values were used to generate a cumulative screening score indicating whether a patient may have sepsis.A total of 500 patients were screened. The incidence of sepsis in the present study population was 8.4%. The screening tool yielded a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 78.4%, a positive predictive value of 26.7%, and a negative predictive value of 98.4%.Heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature have good diagnostic potential for the early identification of sepsis among emergency department triage personnel. Additionally, early evidence suggests StO2 may play a complementary and synergistic role in the early identification of sepsis by triage personnel.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713469","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.803914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.795066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.78188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Respiratory rate","weight":0.711032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.284098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.247145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Age of consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
