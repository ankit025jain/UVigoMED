{"id":14639,"title":"A review of the cat liver fluke Platynosomum fastosum Kossack, 1910 (Trematoda: Dicrocoeliidae).","abstract":"Platynosomum fastosum is a small hepatic trematode found in the biliary ducts and gall bladder of cats and other mammals. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Some aspect of the life cycle of this parasite is not fully understood, however terrestrial snails, lizards and isopods are implicated as intermediate/paratenic hosts. The disease caused by P. fastosum is platynosomiais (named after the parasite) or 'lizard poisoning' since it is assumed that affected cats acquire the parasite by eating infected lizards. The clinical signs due to infection with P. fastosum may range from asymptomatic to progressive disease and at times death due to biliary tract obstruction and hepatic failure. Infection with this parasite should, therefore, be included in the differential diagnosis of cats with signs of hepatic diseases.
