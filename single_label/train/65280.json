{"id":65280,"title":"A critical analysis of candidacy for penile revascularization.","abstract":"Penile revascularization (PR) is a potentially curative procedure for young men with isolated arteriogenic erectile dysfunction. Standard preoperative evaluation is erectile hemodynamics (HDX) using duplex Doppler penile ultrasound (DUS) and/or cavernosometry (DIC) and assessment of cavernosal arterial anatomy by selective internal pudendal arteriography (SIPA).The aim of this study was to review our experience with men who sought a second opinion from us regarding their candidacy for PR.Study population consisted of men (i) who presented to us for a second opinion regarding PR; (ii) who had DUS/DIC and SIPA; and (iii) had been advised by outside surgeon to undergo PR. Review of the HDX study and SIPA was conducted. Discrepancies between these studies resulted in repeating the DIC in men with normal SIPA or repeating the SIPA in men with normal HDX studies.Discrepancies between HDX and SIPA and the results of repeat HDX or SIPA were the main outcome measures.Forty-five patients participated in the study; mean age was 33 years with 4% ?50 years old. Median vascular risk factor number was 1 (ranged 0-3). A credible trauma history was present in 11%. Thirty-three percent had prior DIC and 49% of patients had a significant discrepancy between HDX study and SIPA, including all patients seen by a community urologist. Thirty-eight percent had a discrepancy between side of abnormality on HDX and SIPA where both studies were abnormal (group A). Seven percent had abnormal HDX and normal SIPA (group B). Four percent had a normal HDX study with an abnormal SIPA (group C). Repeat DIC (n?=?20) was conducted in groups A?+?B and was normal in 70% of cases. Repeat SIPA (n?=?2) was conducted in group C and was normal in both patients.Almost one half of patients had a significant discrepancy between HDX and SIPA. Of these, 73% had normal repeat studies, making them no longer candidates for penile revascularization.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888719","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.711048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.581143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.14228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.114233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Critical theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Pudendal nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudendal_nerve"},{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Alberta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Internal pudendal artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_pudendal_artery"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Second opinion","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_opinion"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
