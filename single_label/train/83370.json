{"id":83370,"title":"DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa impairs host defense in pneumococcal pneumonia.","abstract":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative organism in community-acquired pneumonia responsible for millions of deaths every year. DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa is an adaptor molecule for different myeloid expressed receptors involved in innate immunity.Animal study.University research laboratory.DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa-deficient (dap12) and wild-type mice.Mice were intranasally infected with S. pneumoniae. In addition, ex vivo responsiveness of alveolar macrophages was examined.dap12 alveolar macrophages released more tumor necrosis factor-? upon stimulation with S. pneumoniae and displayed increased phagocytosis of this pathogen compared with wild-type cells. After infection with S. pneumoniae via the airways, dap12 mice demonstrated reduced bacterial outgrowth in the lungs together with delayed dissemination to distant body sites relative to wild-type mice. This favorable response in dap12 mice was accompanied by reduced lung inflammation and an improved survival.These data suggest that DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa impairs host defense during pneumococcal pneumonia at the primary site of infection at least in part by inhibiting phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.","date":"2014-11-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25402298","annotations":[{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.903253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.789416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.76292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacterial pneumonia","weight":0.583644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_pneumonia"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.362101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.141983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Adapter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
