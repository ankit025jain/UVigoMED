{"id":53855,"title":"Interleukin-6 signal transduction and its role in hepatic lipid metabolic disorders.","abstract":"Hepatic lipid dysregulation can lead to spectrum of metabolic disease conditions including metabolic syndrome (MS), fatty liver and diabetes. Liver lipids are regulated by a complex set of extra-hepatic and intra-hepatic factors including cellular cross-talk with variety of cells, inducing various cytokines. Interleukin 6(IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects on hepatic system through either JNK/STAT or ERK/MAPK signaling. Although, IL-6 has shown to protect the liver from fat storage in both rodent and human models and various IL-6(-/-) studies have supported this notion yet a question remains over its deleterious pro-inflammatory effects on hepatocytes. IL-6 ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently disturb the hepatic lipid balance has created a conundrum. Furthermore, IL-6 has shown to behave differently under different disease states within hepatocytes and hence, modulating the hepatic lipids accordingly. This review deals with the role of IL-6 on hepatic lipid metabolism and analyzes various data presented on this topic.
