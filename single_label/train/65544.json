{"id":65544,"title":"Lack of drug dosing guidelines for critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy.","abstract":"Acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy is common, costly, and associated with mortality rates of up to 60%. Accurate pharmacokinetic data are essential to developing rational individualized dosing strategies and providing optimal care to these patients, yet few such data exist, probably due in part to an absence of regulatory guidance on the issue. The Kidney Health Initiative is working with stakeholders to propose strategies to address this in a standardized manner.
