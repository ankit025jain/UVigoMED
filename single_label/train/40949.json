{"id":40949,"title":"[Analysis of the role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in children with pancreaticobiliary diseases].","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in children with pancreaticobiliary diseases and the characteristics of pancreaticobiliary disorders in children.Retrospective review was conducted on the data of patients younger than 18 years who underwent ERCP between 2005 and 2012 at West China Hospital. The indications,ERCP findings, ERCP procedures, complications, and clinical outcomes were evaluated.ERCP procedures were performed using standard duodenoscopes under general anaesthesia or sedation, which included all endoscopic treatments, such as endoscopic sphincteropapillotomy, stone extraction, stent treatment and so on.One hundred and two ERCPs were performed on 68 patients, and all the procedures were successfully completed in 100% cases. There were 39 girls (57%), and median age at time of procedure was 14.6 years (range, 5-17 years).General anesthesia and sedation were performed in 81% and 19% of procedures, respectively. The ERCP findings were classified as follows:bile duct stone(s) (n = 37, 54%), pancreatic duct stone(s) (n = 8, 12%), bile duct benign stricture (n = 7, 10%) and other nonmalignant pancreaticobiliary diseases (n = 16, 24%).Four cases (4/102, prevalence 4%) were complicated with post-ERCP pancreatitis.Symptoms such as abdominal pain and jaundice were cured obviously after the procedures of ERCP were performed.The main characteristics of pancreaticobiliary disorders in children were nonmalignant pancreaticobiliary diseases, such as bile duct stone, pancreatic duct stone, and bile/pancreatic duct benign stricture.When performed by well-trained endoscopists, ERCP is safe and effective in children.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969928","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.710265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.709989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.686939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.644551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Retrograde amnesia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
