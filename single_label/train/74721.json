{"id":74721,"title":"Preoperative factors of apathy in subthalamic stimulated Parkinson disease: a PET study.","abstract":"The current literature provides discrepant results regarding preoperative sociodemographic and clinical factors, and no information about preoperative cerebral metabolic patterns associated with apathy after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson disease.To resolve this issue, we set out to identify preoperative metabolic patterns and sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with increased apathy after STN-DBS. Forty-four patients with Parkinson disease were enrolled in this study. They all underwent STN-DBS. Metabolic activity was assessed with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET 3 months before surgery. Apathy was assessed on the Apathy Evaluation Scale 3 months before and after STN-DBS. We controlled for preoperative age, levodopa therapy, and overall cognitive functions.Increased apathy after STN-DBS was significantly associated with reduced preoperative metabolism within the right ventral striatum. None of the sociodemographic and clinical variables tested were associated with apathy after STN-DBS.Preoperative PET, but not sociodemographic or clinical factors, is associated with apathy after STN-DBS.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253750","annotations":[{"name":"L-DOPA","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Deep brain stimulation","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"},{"name":"Subthalamic nucleus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subthalamic_nucleus"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.795517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Apathy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.755469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.6301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.601022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.430849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ventral striatum","weight":0.0506351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_striatum"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Subthalamus","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subthalamus"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
