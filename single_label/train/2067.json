{"id":2067,"title":"Crohn's disease presenting with acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"Crohn's disease is often accompanied by extraintestinal inflammation. Acute pancreatitis can be a rare manifestation of Crohn's disease. The present report describes a patient who developed two episodes of pancreatitis before the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Clinical and laboratory evaluation excluded other causes of pancreatitis, confirming a direct association of the pancreatitis with Crohn's disease. This case report supports the hypothesis that acute pancreatitis may precede the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease.","date":"2014-12-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509209","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.282584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"}]}
