{"id":8045,"title":"Detection of Newcastle disease virus minor genetic variants by modified single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis.","abstract":"Newcastle disease and Avian Influenza are considered to be the most dangerous fowl diseases which may cause huge economic losses. Newcastle disease is caused by the enveloped, and single-stranded RNA virus (NDV, APMV-1; belonging to Paramyxoviridae family), which can be further divided into sixteen different genotypes grouped into five pathotypes according to their pathogenicity. It has been reported that low pathogenic virus can greatly increase its pathogenicity even during a single passage. Additionally, due to the widespread use of live vaccines, a mixture of two or more different viruses in one sample can be detected. Hence, there is a great need for establishment of fast, inexpensive, sensitive, and relatively simple diagnostic method for multistrain and quasispecies detection of NDV infection. In this paper we describe a diagnostic method based on RT-PCR followed by a modified version of single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis using short DNA fragments of gene encoding viral F protein. The method allows for rapid diagnosis of genetic variant emerging from previously stable population which may prevent the spread of the pathogenic viral variant.
