{"id":12541,"title":"[A review of porcine torovirus research: etiology and epidemiology].","abstract":"Porcine Torovirus (PToV) is widely distributed in the world with high prevalence rate in swinery. Due to the high detection rate in diarrhea pigs, PToV is thought to be a potential pathogen of swine diarrhea. In recent years, epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality in China have caused great economic losses. Intertypic recombination events and antigenic cross-reactivity among toroviruses implies potential zoonotic transmission of PToV. The review represented the development history of PToV and made a brief summary of the features in genome and protein epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis of the PToV, and so on.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520775","annotations":[{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.714642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.67526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.542296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.347321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"History","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0293009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
