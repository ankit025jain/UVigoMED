{"id":12903,"title":"Development of a live attenuated vaccine candidate against duck Tembusu viral disease.","abstract":"Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is a newly emerging pathogenic flavivirus that is causing massive economic loss in the Chinese duck industry. To obtain a live vaccine candidate against the disease, the DTMUV isolate FX2010 was passaged serially in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). Characterization of FX2010-180P revealed that it was unable to replicate efficiently in chicken embryonated eggs, nor intranasally infect mice or shelducks at high doses of 5.5log10 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50). FX2010-180P did not induce clinical symptoms, or pathological lesions in ducks at a dose of 5.5log10TCID50. The attenuation of FX2010-180P was due to 19 amino acid changes and 15 synonymous mutations. Importantly, FX2010-180P elicited good immune responses in ducks inoculated at low doses (3.5log10TCID50) and provided complete protection against challenge with a virulent strain. These results indicate that FX2010-180P is a promising candidate live vaccine for prevention of duck Tembusu viral disease.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503086","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Flavivirus","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavivirus"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Tissue culture","weight":0.721734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_culture"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.707573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.599891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.496625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.484219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.45454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.40029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.309722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.240846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Synonym (taxonomy)","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.126925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Synonymous substitution","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonymous_substitution"},{"name":"Nasal administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_administration"},{"name":"Logging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"}]}
