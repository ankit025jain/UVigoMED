{"id":55300,"title":"Evaluation of anterior segment parameters using the Pentacam in hyperopic anisometropic amblyopic and normal eyes.","abstract":"To evaluate differences in anterior segment parameters using the Pentacam between hyperopic anisometropic amblyopic eyes and normal eyes.The amblyopic and fellow eyes of children with hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia and the right eyes of normal control subjects were prospectively evaluated using the Pentacam under photopic, scotopic, and cycloplegic conditions. Hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia was defined as hyperopia of ?1.5 D, an interocular difference of at least 1.5 D in spherical equivalent, and a visual acuity difference between the amblyopic and normal eyes of at least 2 lines on the Snellen chart.A total of 34 amblyopic subjects and 36 controls were included. There were no significant differences in the anterior corneal curvature, posterior corneal curvature, central corneal thickness, corneal volume, anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber volume, and pupil diameter between amblyopic, fellow, and normal eyes (P > 0.05).In this patient cohort the Pentacam detected no significant differences in anterior segment parameters in hyperopic anisometropic amblyopic, fellow, and normal eyes under photopic, scotopic, and cycloplegic conditions.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924277","annotations":[{"name":"Cycloplegia","weight":0.914211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloplegia"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.626629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Anisometropia","weight":0.593984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisometropia"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.585583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Scotopic vision","weight":0.543838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision"},{"name":"Photopic vision","weight":0.399795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"}]}
