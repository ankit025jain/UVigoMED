{"id":43337,"title":"The need for a sequencing-based assay to supplement the Abbott m2000 RealTime HCV Genotype II assay: a 1 year analysis.","abstract":"Hepatitis C (HCV) genotyping is important for treatment planning. The Abbott m2000 RealTime HCV Genotype II assay is a PCR-based assay targeting specific regions of the 5'NCR gene for genotypes 1-6, and the NS5b gene for subgenotypes 1a/1b. However, not all genotypes can be resolved, with results being reported as: 'indeterminate', 'mixed', 'genotype X reactivity with Y', or just the major genotype 1 alone.To assess the supplementary testing required for these unresolved HCV genotypes, these samples were tested further using an in-house core/E1 sequencing assay. The resulting genotypes/subgenotypes were assigned using phylogenetic analysis with reference HCV genotype sequences. Additional testing was conducted using the INNO-LiPA HCV II assay for truly mixed genotypes.Out of 1052 samples tested, 89 (8.5%) underwent further sequencing to determine the HCV genotype: 16 that were 'indeterminate' on the m2000, were mostly genotype 2s and 3s by sequencing; 12 that were 'mixed', were mostly one of the genotypes reported in the mixture; 7 that were 'X reactivity with Y', were usually genotype X; 54 that gave just a major genotype 1 result were mostly 1a, with some 6 and 1b, and a few 1c. For three truly mixed genotypes, additional testing using the VERSANT(Â®) HCV Genotype Assay (LiPA) 2.0, showed two mixed 1 and 3, and one indistinguishable 6c-6l genotypes.The Abbott m2000 RealTime HCV Genotype II assay can resolve most (?90%) HCV genotypes. However in 9-10% of cases, to fully resolve the genotype, additional testing is required.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794397","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.84227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.588141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.558915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.272506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.271573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.043079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1052","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1052"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"RZA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RZA"},{"name":"Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Supplementary angles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles"},{"name":"Abbott Laboratories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories"},{"name":"A1 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_(band)"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"NCR Corporation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCR_Corporation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Realtime (radio show)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realtime_(radio_show)"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"}]}
