{"id":59155,"title":"Cervical cancer detection by time-resolved spectra of blood components.","abstract":"Fluorescence spectral techniques are very sensitive, and hence they are gaining importance in cancer detection. The biomarkers indicative of cancer could be identified and quantified by spectral or time domain fluorescence spectroscopy. The results of an investigation of time-resolved spectra of cellular components of blood obtained from cervical cancer patients and normal controls are given. The cancer indicative biomarker in this paper is porphyrin; it has a fluorescence decay time of 60% more in samples of cancer patients than those of normal controls. Based on such measurements, a randomized set comprising samples from cancer patients and controls (N=27 in total) could be classified with sensitivity (92%) and specificity (86%).","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853147","annotations":[{"name":"Porphyrin","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrin"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Fluorescence spectroscopy","weight":0.721898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.716871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.592859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.14971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"N27 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N27_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Time domain","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Sampling (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Spectral graph theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory"},{"name":"Diffusion (acoustics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_(acoustics)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"List of human blood components","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_blood_components"}]}
