{"id":77069,"title":"Update on screening, etiology, and treatment of dyslipidemia in children.","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early identification and treatment of risk factors that accelerate this condition are paramount to preventing disease. To this effect, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, issued updated pediatric guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction in 2011. Integration of these guidelines into pediatric practice may lessen cardiovascular morbidity.In addition to reviewing the NHLBI guidelines, a detailed literature search was performed on PubMed for clinical studies published between 2010 and 2013. Key search terms included \"pediatric dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia,\" \"cardiovascular disease,\" \"atherosclerosis,\" \"familial hypercholesterolemia,\" \"hypertriglyceridemia,\" and \"diabetes.\" Additional citations from these publications were also reviewed. Final publications were selected for their relevance to the topic.These guidelines contain several important recommendations relative to lipid management, including screening all children with nonfasting non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol at ages 9-11 years, incorporation of aggressive lifestyle changes to meet cholesterol targets, and initiation of statin therapy for those with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol elevation. In addition, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are now considered high-risk conditions and have stringent cholesterol targets. The primary aim is early identification of children with familial hypercholesterolemia; however, these recommendations have met with some controversy. The purpose of this update is to summarize these recent lipid guidelines, present the relevant controversies, highlight common cholesterol disorders, and discuss dyslipidemia specific to the pediatric diabetes population.Identification and treatment of youth with dyslipidemia is of paramount importance to the reduction of future cardiovascular disease. Increasing the comprehension and application of the newest NHLBI guidelines is critical to improving cardiovascular outcomes.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848708","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"American Academy of Pediatrics","weight":0.835104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.78837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.758399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.62819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute","weight":0.622752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Heart,_Lung,_and_Blood_Institute"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.590167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Familial hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.190549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
