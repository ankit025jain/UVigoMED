{"id":51377,"title":"The new era of healthcare: incorporating patients' rights and responsibilities in diabetes management.","abstract":"As the healthcare landscape changes and federal regulatory guidelines come into effect, it is up to providers and patients to work together to effectively coordinate care so that optimal healthcare can be provided. Most patients know that they have medical rights but most do not know that there are medical responsibilities that they too must comply with to facilitate their care with the help of providers' judgment and medical knowledge. Optimizing patient education can enable better communication, comprehension, and compliance among patients. Physicians can successfully implement these types of changes, as well as ensure that federal guidelines are instituted, thus improving overall patient outcomes.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696965","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.269901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.109928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.0388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Landscape","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_consequences_of_marriage_and_civil_partnership_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Regulatory compliance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance"},{"name":"Judgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"}]}
