{"id":7391,"title":"Inflammatory pain may induce cognitive impairment through an interlukin-6-dependent and postsynaptic density-95-associated mechanism.","abstract":"Pain might be associated with cognitive impairment in humans. However, the characterization of such effects in a preclinical model and the investigation of the underlying mechanisms remain largely to be determined. We therefore sought to establish a system to determine the effect of pain on cognitive function in mice.Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected in the hindpaw of 5- to 8-month-old wild-type and interleukin-6 knockout mice. Learning and memory function, and the levels of interleukin-6 and postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 in the cortex and hippocampus of mice were assessed.We found that the CFA injection-induced pain in the mice at 3 and 7 days after injection and decreased the freezing time (30.1 [16.5] vs 56.8 [28.1] seconds, P =0.023) in the tone test, which assesses the hippocampus-independent learning and memory function, but not in a context test of Fear Conditioning System (15.8 [6.7] vs 18.6 [8.8] seconds, P =0.622), which assesses the hippocampus-dependent learning and memory function, at 3 days after injection. Consistently, the CFA injection increased interleukin-6 (248% [11.6] vs 100% [7.9], P < 0.0001) and decreased the PSD-95 (40% [10.0] vs 100% [20.3], P < 0.0001) level in the cortex, but not hippocampus (95% [8.6] vs 100% [9.3], P =0.634), in the mice. The CFA injection induced neither reduction in the cortex PSD-95 levels nor cognitive impairment in the interleukin-6 knockout mice.These results suggest that pain induced by CFA injection might increase interleukin-6 levels and decrease PSD-95 levels in the cortex, but not hippocampus of mice, leading to hippocampus-independent cognitive impairment in mice. These findings call for further investigation to determine the role of pain in cognitive function.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878682","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.488001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.430451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.349751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.310572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.298481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.264682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.147495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Postsynaptic density","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postsynaptic_density"},{"name":"DLG4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLG4"},{"name":"622","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/622"},{"name":"634","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/634"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Memory bound function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_bound_function"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party (Portugal)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Portugal)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Melting point","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
