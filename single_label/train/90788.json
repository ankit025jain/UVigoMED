{"id":90788,"title":"The effect of distal radius translation in the coronal plane on forearm rotation: a cadaveric study of distal radius fractures.","abstract":"To determine the effect of lateral translation of the distal radius in the coronal plane on forearm rotation after distal radius fracture.Ten fresh cadaveric limbs underwent distal radius osteotomy just proximal to the distal radial-ulnar joint to simulate an extra-articular distal radius fracture. We used an Agee Wrist Jack external fixator to create increasing magnitudes of distal fragment lateral translation in 2-mm increments. Forearm rotation was measured using a 3-dimensional camera at each magnitude of lateral translation.Total forearm rotation for the intact specimen and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm (maximal) radial translations was 186° ± 53°, 188° ± 54°, 189° ± 55°, 190° ± 57°, and 193° ± 59°, respectively. There was no significant difference for any magnitude of radial translation. The average maximal radial translation possible before radioulnar abutment was 8 ± 0.5 mm.In this cadaveric model, translation of the distal radius fragment in the lateral direction had no effect on forearm rotation.At the level of the proximal border of the distal radioulnar joint, isolated distal radius translation does not significantly affect forearm rotation.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576752","annotations":[{"name":"Distal radioulnar articulation","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radioulnar_articulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.710558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.671821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.640941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.324864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0174397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"James Agee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee"},{"name":"Holotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Radioulnar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Radioulnar joint","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar_joint"}]}
