{"id":68208,"title":"Anti-VEGF therapy in mRCC: differences between Asian and non-Asian patients.","abstract":"Several reports suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) may be more toxic in Asian vs non-Asian populations. Comparative efficacy of these agents with respect to ethnicity is not well characterised.A multicentre, retrospective, cohort study using Asian and non-Asian centres which collected data on ethnicity, dose reductions and outcomes using the International mRCC Database Consortium.This study included 1024 (464 Asian, 560 non-Asian) patients with a 29.4 months median follow-up. The percentage of dose modifications/reductions between non-Asians and Asians was similar (55% vs 61% P=0.1197). When adjusted for risk groups, there was no difference in overall or progression-free survival between non-Asians and Asians. Patients with dose reductions due to toxicity had longer treatment durations and overall survival than those who did not in both non-Asian (10.6 vs 5.0 months, P<0.0001; 22.6 vs 16.1 months, P=0.0016, respectively) and Asian populations (8.9 vs 5.4 months, P=0.0028; 28.0 vs 18.7 months, P=0.0069, respectively).Adjusting for risk groups, there appears to be no difference in outcome between Asian vs non-Asian patients with mRCC treated with VEGF-targeted therapy. Judicious dose reductions may allow for better outcomes in both populations due to longer treatment durations, but direct comparisons are needed.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548864","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.800237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.792177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.616849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.472176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"1024","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1024"},{"name":"1197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1197"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Consortium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
