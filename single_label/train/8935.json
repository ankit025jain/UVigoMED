{"id":8935,"title":"Mesenteric lymph duct ligation after hemorrhagic shock enhances the ATP level and ATPase activity in rat kidneys.","abstract":"Kidney injury commonly occurs following hemorrhagic shock. This study aims to observe the effects of mesenteric lymph duct ligation (MLDL) on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and the cell membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in the kidneys of rats subjected to hemorrhagic shock.Wistar rats were assigned into sham, shock, and ligation groups. The hemorrhagic shock model was established in the shock and ligation groups, and MLDL was performed in the ligation group after resuscitation. Renal homogenates were prepared to determine the ATP and ATPase levels at 90 min after hemorrhage and at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after resuscitation.The ATP levels, and the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Mg(2+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase, and Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase activities in the renal tissue of the shock group were lower than those in the sham group at the multiple time points. Furthermore, the corresponding values in the ligation group were significantly higher than those in the shock group at multiple time points.MLDL improves energy metabolism and enhances the ATPase activity in the kidneys of hemorrhagic shock rats, along with other mechanisms that alleviate renal injury after hemorrhagic shock.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742208","annotations":[{"name":"Na+/K+-ATPase","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na+/K+-ATPase"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.721553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"ATPase","weight":0.622752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATPase"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.491439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.459397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.324282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Polyphosphate","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphosphate"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"DNA ligase","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_ligase"}]}
