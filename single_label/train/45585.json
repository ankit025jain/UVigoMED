{"id":45585,"title":"TNF-? promotes gallbladder cancer cell growth and invasion through autocrine mechanisms.","abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) has been suggested to be a putative tumor promoter gene, and autocrine of TNF-? expression has been found in colon cancer and ovarian cancer. As the role of autocrine TNF-? in human gallbladder cancer has not yet been elucidated, the present study examined the expression of TNF-? in gallbladder cancer-derived cell lines. Based on the data, TNF-? mRNA and TNF-? protein expression differed significantly different between the cell lines. In addition, using siRNA targeting TNF-?, the vector, pGPU-GFP-siTNF-?, was constructed and then transfected into the SGC-996 cells (gallbladder cancer cell line) which express high levels of endogenous TNF-?. In vitro experiments indicated that the silencing of TNF-? in the SGC-996 cells significantly suppressed proliferation and invasion. However, apoptosis was not induced by the silencing of TNF-?. Furthermore, we traced the mechanisms underlying these effects and found that the silencing of TNF-? affected the TNF-?-AKT-NF-?B-Bcl-2 pathway in the SGC-996 cells. Our data provide evidence that autocrine TNF-? plays a role as a tumor promoter gene in gallbladder cancer cells, possibly by promoting proliferation and invasion through autocrine mechanisms.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676340","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.850105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.754085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.705727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.673012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.60383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.521298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.465642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.420029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.337084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Tumor promotion","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_promotion"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
