{"id":61997,"title":"A Phase III, randomized, open-label trial of ferumoxytol compared with iron sucrose for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy.","abstract":"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common form of anemia worldwide. Although oral iron is used as first-line treatment, many patients are unresponsive to or cannot take oral iron. This Phase III, open-label, non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of ferumoxytol, a rapid, injectable intravenous (IV) iron product with low immunological reactivity and minimal detectable free iron, with IV iron sucrose in adults with IDA of any cause. Patients (N = 605) were randomized 2:1 to receive ferumoxytol (n = 406, two doses of 510 mg 5 Â± 3 days apart) or iron sucrose (n = 199, five doses of 200 mg on five nonconsecutive days over 14 days) and followed for 5 weeks. Ferumoxytol demonstrated noninferiority to iron sucrose at the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving a hemoglobin increase of ?2 g dL(-1) at any time from Baseline to Week 5 (ferumoxytol, 84.0% [n = 406] vs. iron sucrose, 81.4% [n = 199]), with a noninferiority margin of 15%. Ferumoxytol was superior to iron sucrose (2.7 g dL(-1) vs. 2.4 g dL(-1) ) in the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 (the alternative preplanned primary endpoint) with P = 0.0124. Transferrin saturation, quality-of-life measures, and safety outcomes were similar between the two treatment groups. Overall, ferumoxytol demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy to iron sucrose, suggesting that ferumoxytol may be a useful treatment option for patients with IDA in whom oral iron was unsatisfactory or could not be used.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639149","annotations":[{"name":"Iron deficiency anemia","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.674928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.641002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.599967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.559674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.507145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Decilitre","weight":0.460708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decilitre"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.456969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.377373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.341152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Transferrin saturation","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_saturation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Uncial 070","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_070"},{"name":"International Development Association","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Association"}]}
