{"id":84819,"title":"[Comparison of therapeutic effects between patella replacement and patella osteotomy in total knee arthroplasty: a case-control study].","abstract":"To compare therapeutic effects between patella replacement and patella osteotomy in total knee arthroplasty.From April 2004 to April 2011, 52 patients (54 knees) were enrolled in the clinical trail of total knee arthroplasty, who received patella replacement (24 knees, including 13 males and 11 females,ranging in age from 53 to 78 years old or patella osteotomy (30 knees,including 16 males and 12 females,ranging in age from 55 to 79 years old. The average follow-up period was 56 months,ranging from 20 to 80 months. The American HSS Score for knee, the Feller score for patella, range of motion (ROM) for knee, patient satisfaction and complications related to the patella were used to evaluate therapeutic effects.In the patella replacement group,the preoperative and final follow-up HSS scores of patients were 38.4 +/- 8.2 and 91.2 +/- 8.6 respectively; Feller scores were 13.6 +/- 6.2 and 25.2 +/- 4.2; scores of anterior knee pain were 3.9 +/- 3.2 and 11.2 +/- 3.7; ROM were (78 +/- 26) degrees and(108 +/- 18) degrees. In the patella osteotomy group,the preoperative and final follow-up HSS scores of patients were 39.5 +/- 8.4 and 91.0 +/- 8.5 respectively;Feller scores were 13.4 +/- 6.5 and 25.6 +/- 4.0; scores of anterior knee pain were 3.7 +/- 3.1 and 11.3 +/- 3.6; ROM were (76 +/- 27) degrees and (110 +/- 19) degrees. In the patella replacement group,patient's satisfaction was 91%, and complication related to the patella was 16.7%; in the patella osteotomy group, patient's satisfaction was 89%, and complications related to the patella was 10.0%. There were no statistically significant differeneces in final follow-up HSS scores, Feller scores, scores of anterior knee pain and ROM between the two groups. However,there was no significant difference of patient's satisfaction between them. There was statistically significant differenece of patella-related complications between the two groups, and the complication rate in the patella replacement group was higher than that in the patella osteotomy group.Total knee arthroplasty with patella replacement or patella osteotomy dramatically relieves pain and improves the knee function. Patella-related complications are associated with its treatment methods, but post-operative anterior knee pain and patient's satisfaction are not related to treatment methods of the patella.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029831","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.671175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.496351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.472668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.376941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.240812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Croatian Peasant Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Peasant_Party"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
