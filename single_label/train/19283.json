{"id":19283,"title":"Infective endocarditis due to Granulicatella adiacens: a case report and review.","abstract":"Infective endocarditis (IE) caused by nutritionally variant Streptococci (NVS) is associated with high bacteriologic and treatment failure and mortality rates compared to endocarditis caused by other Streptococci. With automated blood culture systems, the rates of NVS-associated IE accounts for 5%-6% cases. We report a case of IE caused by NVS in an elderly female patient with no risk factors. The patient was successfully treated with combination antimicrobial therapy.
