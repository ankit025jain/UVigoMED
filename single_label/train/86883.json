{"id":86883,"title":"[Is the fight against dengue complicated with the emergence of a new viral serotype?].","abstract":"Dengue is a viral acute febrile illness, currently considered one of the most important arbovirosis worldwide in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic impact. Various theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of severe forms of dengue, involving among other factors, features related to the virus, such as the presence of more virulent strains and/or strains with increased replicative capacity. A crucial point at this time is the discovery of a new viral type, dengue 5, from nonhuman primates in Malaysia-Borneo, which could result in greater difficulties for control and vaccine production (currently in efficacy tests). Once the circulation of this viral type has been demonstrated in the human population, the high risk of infection will have extreme or controversial public health implications. Therefore, a worldwide program to combat dengue should include an urgent need to implement continuous vector elimination, community education and prevention and control of the disease. Only then, we will be aiming to reduce the morbidity and transmission risk of dengue, while new technological and effective alternatives come about.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272519","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.799616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.740542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.666807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.552802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.309663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.304485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.27783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.120456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0236217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Risk of infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_infection"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
