{"id":52750,"title":"Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of cognitive dysfunction in carotid endarterectomy patients.","abstract":"Systemic inflammation has been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a reliable measure of systemic inflammation. We hypothesize that patients with elevated preoperative NLR have increased risk of cognitive dysfunction 1 day after CEA.Five hundred fifty-one patients scheduled for CEA were enrolled at Columbia University in New York, NY from 1995 to 2012. NLR was retrospectively reviewed; only 432 patients had preoperative NLR values available within 2 weeks of CEA. NLR was analyzed as a continuous variable and categorically with a cutoff of ?5 and <5 and equal tertiles, as done in previous studies.Patients with cognitive dysfunction had significantly higher NLR than those without cognitive dysfunction (4.5 ± 4.0 vs 3.2 ± 2.6; P < .001). The incidence of cognitive dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with NLR ?5 than NLR <5 (34.7% vs 12.8%; P < .001). Significantly fewer patients in the low tertile had cognitive dysfunction than in the high tertile (6.9% vs 25.9%; P <.001) and middle tertile (6.9% vs 17.4%; P = .006). In the final multivariate model, diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-3.75; P = .03) and NLR ?5 (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.81-6.27; P < .001) were significantly associated with higher odds of cognitive dysfunction, while statin use was significantly associated with lower odds (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.84; P = .01).Preoperative NLR is associated with cognitive dysfunction 1 day after CEA. NLR ?5 and diabetes mellitus are significantly associated with increased odds of cognitive dysfunction whereas statin use is significantly associated with decreased odds.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571940","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes
