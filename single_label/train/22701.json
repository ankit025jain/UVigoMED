{"id":22701,"title":"Early dynamics of leptin plasma level in surgical critically ill patients. a prospective comparative study.","abstract":"Leptin (LPT), a hormone secreted by adipocytes,plays a role in inflammation and infection. Our study aimed to characterize the early dynamics of LPT in comparison with CRP and IL-6 during systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS) and sepsis in surgical patients.Sixty patients were assigned into 3 equal groups:SIRS (SI) group with major abdominal elective surgery;sepsis (SE) group with community-acquired complicated intra-abdominal infection and controls (C). LPT, CRP and IL-6 were measured initially in all groups and repeated in groups SI and SE within 5 days after surgery (9 samples - 4 day 1, 2 day 2, 1 next 3 days).LPT increased at 12-24 hours in SI group, but stayed within normal range in SE group. CRP and IL-6 had higher values in SE group versus SI group with an early peak for IL-6 and a late peak for CRP.LPT has a different early dynamics during SIRS and sepsis. LPT measurement in association with CRP or IL-6 may be useful in the differential diagnosis and prognosis of surgical critical illness at different time courses.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524473","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.829053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.74293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.359022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.328977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.160085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1224"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"LPT","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPT"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
