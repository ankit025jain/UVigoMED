{"id":89677,"title":"[Pseudarthrosis of the long bones].","abstract":"5 to 10% of all fractures present with a delayed union, whereas 1 to 5% progress to a nonunion, which can be defined as a fracture older than 6 months and lacks any potential to heal without any further intervention. Different fracture and patient related risk factors exist, and the management of a nonunion needs a thorough clinical, radiological and biological workup to classify them in one of the two main categories, the viable nonunions that need essentially more stability, usually by a more rigid fixation, and the non-viable nonunions that need essentially a biological stimulation by decortication and bone grafting. This treatment still remains the first choice with bony healing obtained in 85 to 95% of cases, but it also comes along with certain risks, and some valuable alternatives exist if chosen on the basis of rigid criteria.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693590","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.366522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.171686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Decortication of lung","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decortication_of_lung"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Fetal viability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
