{"id":68395,"title":"Kidney injury molecule-1 expression in IgA nephropathy and its correlation with hypoxia and tubulointerstitial inflammation.","abstract":"Tubulointerstitial injury plays an important role in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 is induced in damaged proximal tubules in both acute renal injury and CKD. However, the dynamics of KIM-1 in CKD and effects of KIM-1 expression on disease progression are unknown. Here, we aimed to determine the associations between tubular KIM-1 expression levels, renal function, and inflammation in CKD. The relationships between levels of KIM-1 and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed in patients with progressive and nonprogressive IgA nephropathy. KIM-1 expression was increased in patients with IgA nephropathy, and its expression was significantly correlated with the decrease of renal function. KIM-1 was particularly evident at the site with reduced capillary density, and KIM-1-positive tubules were surrounded by infiltrates of inflammatory cells. Using in vitro cell models, we showed that cellular stressors, including hypoxia, induced KIM-1 expression. KIM-1-expressing cells produced more chemokines/cytokines when cultured under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we showed that tubular cells with KIM-1 expression can regulate the immune response of inflammatory cells through the secretion of chemotactic factors. These data suggest that KIM-1-expressing epithelial cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial inflammation during chronic renal injury through the secretion of chemokines/cytokines.
