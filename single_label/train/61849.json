{"id":61849,"title":"Peripheral blood 8 colour flow cytometry monitoring of hairy cell leukaemia allows detection of high-risk patients.","abstract":"Although purine analogues have significantly improved the outcome of hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) patients, 30-40% relapse, illustrating the need for minimal residual disease (MRD) markers that can aid personalized therapeutic management. Diagnostic samples from 34 HCL patients were used to design an 8-colour flow cytometry (8-FC) tube for blood MRD (B/RD) analysis (188 samples) which was compared to quantitative IGH polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) on 83 samples and to qualitative consensus IGH PCR clonality analysis on 165 samples. Despite heterogeneous HCL phenotypes at diagnosis, discrimination from normal B lymphocytes was possible in all cases using a single 8-FC tube, with a robust sensitivity of detection of 10(-4) , comparable to Q-PCR at this level, but preferable in terms of informativeness, simplicity and cost. B/RD assessment of 15 patients achieving haematological complete remission after purine analogues was predictive of a clinically significant relapse risk: with a median follow-up of 95 months; only one of the nine patients with reproducible 8-FC B/RD levels below 10(-4) (B/RD(neg) ) relapsed, compared to 5/6 in the B/RD(pos) group (P = 0.003). These data demonstrate the clinical interest of a robust 8-FC HCL B/RD strategy that could become a surrogate biomarker for therapeutic stratification and new drug assessment, which should be evaluated prospectively.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661013","annotations":[{"name":"Flow
