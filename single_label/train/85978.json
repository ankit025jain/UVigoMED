{"id":85978,"title":"Adherence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients to continuous positive airway pressure in a public service.","abstract":"The standard therapy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but its correct and frequent use is essential to control the disease.To analyze adherence to CPAP among patients with OSAS treated in a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic of a public tertiary hospital.This was a retrospective study evaluating 156 patients with OSAS who underwent polysomnography for CPAP titration from 2008 to 2011. The patients were divided into two groups, those with good adherence to CPAP (a mean use of four or more hours per night) and those with poor adherence. The groups were compared regarding the following data: gender, age, body mass index, associated diseases, AHI at diagnostic polysomnography, and pressure (cmH2O) suggested by titration polysomnography.125 patients were analyzed, and it was observed that 82 of the patients (65%) had good adherence, whereas 43 (35%) showed poor adherence. Comparison between groups revealed that patients with a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were those who better adhered to treatment with CPAP.the rate of adherence to CPAP among OSAS patients undergoing clinical monitoring at a public service was 65%. Patients with a higher AHI were those who adhered better to treatment with CPAP.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830970","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.831623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.688107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.351523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.301695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.285267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.212781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.123231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
