{"id":34556,"title":"Tetralogy of fallot and pulmonary valve replacement: timing and techniques in the asymptomatic patient.","abstract":"An increasing number of survivors of congenital heart disease will require repeat surgical intervention. In the tetralogy of Fallot population, the primary indication is for pulmonary valve replacement secondary to pulmonary regurgitation. Although pulmonary valve disruption during repair is initially well tolerated, by the second decade following repair, patients develop increased right ventricular size with potentially decreased function. It is now well accepted that patients experiencing symptoms of heart failure secondary to chronic pulmonary insufficiency undergo pulmonary valve replacement. However, in the asymptomatic population, indications and timing of valve replacement are less clear. This article examines the current literature and presents guidelines regarding pulmonary valve replacement in the asymptomatic patient. Also, in the current era of percutaneous valve replacement, certain technical considerations should be given toward valve replacement and are discussed as well.
