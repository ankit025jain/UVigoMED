The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the chest CT data of patients with pulmonary nodules to compare the intra-observer variability of 3D and two-dimensional (2D) volumetric measurement.Eighty-six pulmonary nodules in chest CT scans of 79 subjects were retrospectively analyzed. One radiologist measured the nodules twice with a 7 days interval using 2D and 3D methods respectively. The maximal diameter (X), the perpendicular diameter (Y) on maximal cross sectional area of the nodule and the caudo-cranial diameter (Z) were measured and the volume was calculated by two models: spherical and elliptical model. The 3D measurements were acquired with semi-automated software with manual adjustment on unsatisfied nodule segmentation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of nodule location and morphology on 3D nodule segmentation. ANOVA and correlation test were used to evaluate the difference among three methods. Bland-Altman method was applied to quantify the intra-observer variability.Software achieved satisfied segmentation for 86.4% nodules. The irregular and juxtavacular nodules have significantly high odds rations (OR) of unsatisfied segmentation as 4.0, 4.5, respectively. The volume measured by three method was significantly different (F=6.5, P=0.012), while the repeated measurements did not led to significant difference (F=1.813, P=0.182). The Spearman correlation efficient between 3D volume and 2D volume with sphere and ellipsoid model was 0.97, 0.88. The 95% limits of agreement of RD between two repeated measurements were -14%-11.6%, -37.7%-39.9% and -39.8%-45.8% for 3D, 2D with elliptical model and spherical model, respectively.The 3D volume measurement of pulmonary nodules is more repeatable than 2D volume measurement. Unsatisfied segmentation can occurred on a small number of nodules, especially for irregular and juxtavascular nodules. For these nodules, the measurement of 3D diameters is recommended.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract
