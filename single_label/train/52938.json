{"id":52938,"title":"Sustained response with gemcitabine plus Nab-paclitaxel after folfirinox failure in metastatic pancreatic cancer: report of an effective new strategy.","abstract":"Folfirinox has shown a benefit in terms of survival and quality of life in first line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, efficacy of second line chemotherapy after folfirinox is still limited. Gemcitabine plus Nab-paclitaxel have been recently validated as first line treatment with an increased overall survival compared to gemcitabine. This combination has never been studied as second-line after folfirinox.A metastatic pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in a 60-year-old patient with a performance status of 0. After 10 cycles of folfirinox, and an initial objective response, we objectively noted progressive disease according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria together with an increased carbohydrate antigen 19-9. The multidisciplinary team decided to use gemcitabine plus Nab-paclitaxel as second line palliative chemotherapy. After 2 months, we obtained an objective response. After 6 months, this response was maintained with an acceptable tolerability.Gemcitabine plus Nab-paclitaxel, as second line palliative chemotherapy, after failure of folfirinox, could be a good strategy for patients with a performance status of 0 and 1. Obviously, this data has to be confirmed in larger patients series and in future comparative clinical studies.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559766","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.801771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.75757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.634623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.554257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Second line (parades)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_line_(parades)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Obviously","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obviously"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
