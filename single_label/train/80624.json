{"id":80624,"title":"Association between Fc-gamma receptor IIa (CD32) gene polymorphism and malaria susceptibility: a meta-analysis based on 6928 subjects.","abstract":"Previous studies about the association between the -131R/H polymorphism in the Fc-gamma receptor IIa (Fc?RIIa) gene and malaria susceptibility have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to clarify more accurately the association of this polymorphism with malaria risk.A systematic literature search of the associated studies up to August 1, 2013, was conducted using the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Medline, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Statistical analyses were performed by STATA12.0 software, with odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Six eligible studies including 4111 malaria cases and 2817 controls were identified. A pooled analysis of these studies pointed to a significant association between the variant H allele and reduced susceptibility to malaria or possible protection against malaria: H vs. R (OR=0.691, POR=0.009); HH vs. RR (OR=0.523, POR=0.013); RH vs. RR (OR=0.770, POR=0.037); RH+HH vs. RR (OR=0.664, POR=0.019); and HH vs. RH+RR (OR=0.649, POR=0.037). In subgroup analysis, similar significant associations were also found in Asia (HH vs. RR: OR=0.137, POR=0.009; HH vs. RH+RR: OR=0.267, POR=0.000) and in Africa (RH vs. RR: OR=0.842, POR=0.002; RH+HH vs. RR: OR=0.859, POR=0.004).This meta-analysis suggests that the variant H allele of the Fc?RIIa-131R/H polymorphism may be a protective factor against blood-stages of malaria infection, both in Asians and Africans. The finding may aid the development of effective immune protection strategies against malaria that focus on antibody responses and enrich current knowledge of gene polymorphism in the malaria. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Parasitic
