{"id":83081,"title":"Gingival margin changes in maxillary anterior sites after single immediate implant placement and provisionalization: a 5-year retrospective study of 47 patients.","abstract":"To evaluate gingival margin changes in the esthetic zone after immediate implant placement and provisionalization over 5 years with a custom anatomic provisional abutment.Single maxillary incisor immediate implant placement and provisionalization procedures, completed and followed between February 2006 and August 2006, were analyzed retrospectively. During clinical recalls at 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years, changes in gingival margins were recorded with clinical photographs and recorded in millimeters.Forty-seven patients each received a single implant (19 central incisors, 28 lateral incisors) and were followed for 5 years. Implants and restorations had a 100% survival rate during the study. The mean gingival margin changes (recession) were 0.17 mm at the time of definitive restoration, 0.27 mm at 3 months, 0.30 mm at 1 year, and 0.30 mm at 5 years. After 5 years, 24 of the 47 implant crowns had no significant gingival recession. All central incisor sites received 4.3-mm-diameter implants and had a mean change in tooth length of 0.03 mm at 5 years. Lateral incisor sites (n=28) received either a 3.5-mm-diameter implant (n=20) or a 4.3-mm-diameter implant (n=8). Lateral sites with the 3.5-mm implant had a mean change in gingival margin height of 0.08 mm of tooth length at 5 years; lateral sites with a 4.3-mm platform displayed a mean change of 0.82 mm of tooth length.This study suggests that implant diameter, gingival biotype, surgical technique, and/or the reason for tooth loss can influence the amount of gingival recession occurring over 5 years. Most recession occurred within the first 3 months, between implant placement/provisionalization and definitive restoration. The use of a customized anatomic provisional abutment can reduce the amount and frequency of recession.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451863","annotations":[{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.712861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Receding gums","weight":0.479775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receding_gums"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Maxillary lateral incisor","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_lateral_incisor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.118004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Maxillary central incisor","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_central_incisor"},{"name":"Gingival margin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_margin"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Biotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"30 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"}]}
