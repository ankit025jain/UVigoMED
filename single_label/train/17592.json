{"id":17592,"title":"Anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus assay of azalomycin F5a and its derivatives.","abstract":"To discover anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) microbial natural products or their derivatives.Azalomycin F5a (1) was prepared through fermentation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. azalomyceticus, and its derivatives were synthesized through hydrocarbylation in hydrocarbyl alcoholic-AcOH (4 : 1) and subsequent demalonylation with 2 mol·L(-1) KOH in MeOH-H2O (7 : 3). Their activities against MRSA ATCC 33592 and three clinical MRSA isolates were evaluated by the agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods.Four demalonylazalomycin F5a derivatives 2 to 5 were synthesized. The anti-MRSA activity assay indicated that compounds 1 to 5 showed remarkable activity against MRSA, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were respectively 3.0-4.0, 0.5-1.0, 0.67-1.0, 0.67-0.83, and 0.5-0.83 ?g·mL(-1).Azalomycin F5a and the demalonylazalomycin F5a derivatives 2-5 showed remarkable anti-MRSA activity, and the anti-MRSA activities of 2 to 5 were higher than that of 1, while the anti-MRSA activities of 2 to 5 showed no obvious differences. It was also shown that the malonyl monoester group of azalomycin F5a was less important for its anti-MRSA activity.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863359","annotations":[{"name":"Ester","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.882065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.777953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.746121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.718164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Streptomyces","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.696382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.656221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Potassium hydroxide","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.46606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Malonate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malonate"},{"name":"American Type Culture Collection","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Culture_Collection"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"670","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/670"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Fujita scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujita_scale"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
