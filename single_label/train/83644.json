{"id":83644,"title":"Tolerance of colonoscopy and questioning its utility in the elderly population.","abstract":"This study was carried out from Jan '12-Dec '12 to assess current practice in Kerry General Hospital against the age related indicators for colonoscopies. A total of 1474 colonoscopies were performed, 1177 (79.9%) were diagnostic and 297 (20.10%) were therapeutic, patients were divided into 4 age groups under 75, 75-80, 81-85, 86+. The trend analysis revealed an increase in diagnostic colonoscopies and decrease in therapeutic colonoscopies with age. 664 (45.04%) of colonoscopies were reported normal which made up the majority of the total diagnoses, 1330 (90.2%) of colonoscopies occurred without any complications. Main complications were patient discomfort being the highest, present in 112 (7.6%) of patients, and lowest being urticaria around the IV site present in 1 (0.1%) of the cases. Patient discomfort was higher in younger patients as evidenced by 98 cases aged < 75, followed by 11 cases aged 75-80, 2 cases aged 81-85 and 1 case aged > 86. Highest percentage of poor tolerance was found in 14 (1.1%) of total patients < 75, 1 (0.8%) of total patients aged 75-80, 1(1.7%) of total patients in age group 81-85 and none (0%) in age group > 86. We have established the safety of colonoscopy, low rate of complications and a better tolerance in the elderly from this study, however, its utility, especially in presence of other comorbidities in elderly is questionable.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282969","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.611043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.495022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.385978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.307781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.10245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1474","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1474"},{"name":"1330","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1330"},{"name":"1177","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1177"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Trend analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_analysis"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Questioning (sexuality and gender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questioning_(sexuality_and_gender)"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Kerry GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_GAA"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
