{"id":90531,"title":"Measurement of the \"safe zone\" and the \"dangerous zone\" for the screw placement on the quadrilateral surface in the treatment of pelvic and acetabular fractures with Stoppa approach by computational 3D technology.","abstract":"This study is aimed at definition of the safe and dangerous zone for screw placement with Stoppa approach for rapid identification during operation and a new way for the studies on the \"safe zone.\" Pelvic CT data of 84 human subjects were recruited to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) models. The distances between the edges of the \"safe zone,\" \"dangerous zone,\" and specific anatomic landmarks such as the obturator canal and the pelvic brim were precisely measured, respectively. The results show that the absolute \"dangerous zone\" was from the pelvic brim to 3.07?cm below it and within 2.86?cm of the obturator canal, while the region 3.56?cm below the pelvic brim or 3.85?cm away from the obturator canal was the absolute \"safe zone\" for screw placement. The region between the absolute \"safe zone\" and the absolute \"dangerous zone\" was the relatively \"dangerous zone.\" As a conclusion, application of computer-assisted 3D modeling techniques aids in the precise measurement of \"safe zone\" and \"dangerous zone\" in combination with Stoppa incision. It was not recommended to place screws on the absolute dangerous zone, while, for the relatively \"dangerous zone,\" it depends on the individual variations in bony anatomy and the fracture type.
