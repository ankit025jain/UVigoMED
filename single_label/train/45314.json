{"id":45314,"title":"Case report of a transfusion-associated hepatitis A infection.","abstract":"Documented transfusion-associated hepatitis A (TAHA) is rare, and blood donors in the United States are not routinely screened for this infection. We report a case of TAHA associated with a donation made 8 days after a donor returned from a trip to South America.This is a review of donor and recipient records and a review of the literature.A donor developed symptoms of hepatitis 20 days after donation (28 days after returning from South America). The donor reported the illness 56 days after donation when contacted to schedule another visit. By this time, the red blood cell and frozen plasma components had been transfused. The recipient of the plasma, a 15-month-old female, tested positive for immunoglobulin?M antibody to hepatitis A virus 43 days after transfusion. The recipient had displayed mild, nonspecific symptoms approximately 2 weeks after transfusion. Hospital infection control investigated the potential for further spread within the hospital because the recipient had been an inpatient for most of the posttransfusion period. The risk of transmission to other patients was determined to be negligible because the patient had been in isolation for other reasons. Family members, who included a health care professional, were counseled and offered prophylaxis.TAHA may be underrecognized. This case was identified only because of a donor report at the time of recruitment. Asymptomatic donor viremia has been documented in plasma donors. Although TAHA rarely results in severe disease, the risk it creates of secondary transmission especially within the hospital setting is not inconsequential.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689888","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.71795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.716729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.687032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.636917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.596781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.582288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.514156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.464158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.326946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.272125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.192303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.165548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Nonspecific symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonspecific_symptoms"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"}]}
