{"id":19549,"title":"[Pore-forming toxins in bacterial infections: targets for novel drugs].","abstract":"Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) form a large group of bacterial virulence factors that play an important role in various infectious diseases. These include infections with problematic pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A and B streptococci, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PFTs perforate host cell membranes, which contributes to the establishment or exacerbation of an infection mainly in two ways: first, by disrupting the host immune response, and second, by helping bacteria to cross epithelial and endothelial barriers, thus allowing them to spread to other parts of the host. Although perforation of the plasma membrane can lead to host cell death, cells possess molecular defence mechanisms and under certain conditions can successfully defend themselves against PFTs. PFTs, as well as the immune response against PFTs, form a potential target for novel prophylactics and therapeutics against bacterial infectious disease, including against antibiotic-resistant strains.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713334","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.448449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.435772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.379929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Crossbreed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreed"}]}
