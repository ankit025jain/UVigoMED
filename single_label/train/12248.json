{"id":12248,"title":"Integrating animal health and food safety surveillance data from slaughterhouse control.","abstract":"Surveillance at the slaughterhouse level for animal health and food safety purposes encompasses examination for the presence of pathology, pathogens, drug residues, chemical contaminants and antimicrobial resistance. Government, industry and academia are the primary proponents of such surveillance. A variety of policies and policy instruments from voluntary to legislative may be applied to promote or obligate participation. Efforts to integrate data across such diverse organisations encounter significant legal, logistical and financial challenges. Enhancement of policies to encourage effective integration of animal health and food safety surveillance data from slaughterhouse control should promote: a long-term approach; collaboration among government, industry and academia; application of a risk-based scheme; and transparent public access to data, with generation of consumer-oriented communications derived from the data. A strong case can be made that the complementary pursuit of both sustainable animal health and food safety can continue to be aided by surveillance at the slaughterhouse level.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24547646","annotations":[{"name":"Food safety","weight":0.789504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.746275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.520212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.439723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.241683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.22658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Slaughterhouse","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.139894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Legislature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0629724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Resistance movement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement"},{"name":"Public-access television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-access_television"}]}
