{"id":75967,"title":"What new modeling approaches will help us identify promising drug treatments?","abstract":"Despite the development of numerous novel antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in recent years, several unmet clinical needs remain, including resistance to AEDs in about 30 % of patients with epilepsy, adverse effects of AEDs that can reduce quality of life, and the lack of treatments that can prevent development of epilepsy in patients at risk. Animal models of seizures and epilepsy have been instrumental in the discovery and preclinical development of novel AEDs, but obviously the previously used models have failed to identify drugs that address unmet medical needs. Thus, we urgently need fresh ideas for improving preclinical AED development. In this review, a number of promising models will be described, including the use of simple vertebrates such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), large animal models such as the dog and newly characterized rodent models of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. While these strategies, like any animal model approach also have their limitations, they offer hope that new more effective AEDs will be identified in the coming years.
