{"id":11991,"title":"Transcriptional response of immune genes in gills and the interbranchial lymphoid tissue of Atlantic salmon challenged with infectious salmon anaemia virus.","abstract":"Previously, it has been assumed that fish lack organized mucosa-associated lymphoid structures. Recently, an interbranchial lymphoid tissue (ILT) was described in salmonid gills at a site with substantial exposure to antigen. In this study, immune responses were examined in gills, mid-kidney and the laser-dissected ILT of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) infected with infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). A strong innate response was observed in gills and mid-kidney and even in the laser-dissected ILT, despite the fact that no virus could be traced in this tissue. A small delayed increase in IgT transcripts, exclusively in the ILT, could indicate that this tissue has a role as a secondary lymphoid organ with clonal expansion of IgT expressing B-cells. Compared to the other examined tissues, gills displayed the earliest replication of the virus, further supporting this tissue as the main entry route for infection with ISAV.
