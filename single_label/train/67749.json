{"id":67749,"title":"Anticipating the effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for patients with urologic cancer.","abstract":"The Affordable Care Act seeks to overhaul the US health care system by providing insurance for more Americans, improving the quality of health care delivery, and reducing health care expenditures. Although the law's intent is clear, its implementation and effect on patient care remains largely undefined. Herein, we discuss major components of the Affordable Care Act, including the proposed insurance expansion, payment and delivery system reforms (e.g., bundled payments and Accountable Care Organizations), and other reforms relevant to the field of urologic oncology. We also discuss how these proposed reforms may affect patients with urologic cancers.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588021","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.730973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","weight":0.524325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.355134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.317857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Accountability","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability"},{"name":"Health care in the United States","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Payment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Calendar reform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_reform"},{"name":"Anticipating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipating"},{"name":"Boom tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_tube"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Product bundling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
