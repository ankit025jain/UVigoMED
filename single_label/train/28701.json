{"id":28701,"title":"Intralipid therapy does not improve level of consciousness in overdoses with sedating drugs: a case series.","abstract":"To assess the effect of intralipid emulsion therapy (ILE) in sedating drugs presenting to an urban emergency department.Following the introduction of a clinical protocol for the use of ILE a retrospective chart review was undertaken, which describes the use of ILE in treating sedating drug overdose in a facility with a tertiary referral level clinical toxicology unit. Demographic data as well as details of drug ingested, physiological parameters and disposition were extracted from the medical record.Over a 7 month period nine cases were treated with intralipid, of which two were male and the median age was 33 years (17-52 years). Endotracheal intubation was required in seven cases and of the other two, one required a nasopharyngeal airway for several hours while being observed in a critical care area. One patient was managed in the intensive care unit without intubation. The median duration of ventilation in the seven patients was 31?h (22-82?h), and median length of stay for all nine cases was 63?h (24-133?h).This study does not support any clinically significant effect of intralipid in sedating drug overdose.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810248","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.808964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Altered level of consciousness","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_level_of_consciousness"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.755917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.222541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Nasopharyngeal airway","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharyngeal_airway"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
