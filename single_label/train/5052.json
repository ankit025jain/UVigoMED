{"id":5052,"title":"Field testing the Unified Classification System for peri-prosthetic fractures of the pelvis and femur around a total hip replacement : an international collaboration.","abstract":"The Unified Classification System (UCS) emphasises the key principles in the assessment and management of peri-prosthetic fractures complicating partial or total joint replacement. We tested the inter- and intra-observer agreement for the UCS as applied to the pelvis and femur using 20 examples of peri-prosthetic fracture in 17 patients. Each subtype of the UCS was represented by at least one case. Specialist orthopaedic surgeons (experts) and orthopaedic residents (pre-experts) assessed reliability on two separate occasions. For the pelvis, the UCS showed inter-observer agreement of 0.837 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.798 to 0.876) for the experts and 0.728 (95% CI 0.689 to 0.767) for the pre-experts. The intra-observer agreement for the experts was 0.861 (95% CI 0.760 to 0.963) and 0.803 (95% 0.688 to 0.918) for the pre-experts. For the femur, the UCS showed an inter-observer kappa value of 0.805 (95% CI 0.765 to 0.845) for the experts and a value of 0.732 (95% CI 0.690 to 0.773) for the pre-experts. The intra-observer agreement was 0.920 (95% CI 0.867 to 0.973) for the experts, and 0.772 (95% CI 0.652 to 0.892) for the pre-experts. This corresponds to a substantial and 'almost perfect' inter- and intra-observer agreement for the UCS for peri-prosthetic fractures of the pelvis and femur. We hope that unifying the terminology of these injuries will assist in their assessment, treatment and outcome.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371459","annotations":[{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.357381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.349561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.160012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.121602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0602196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"867","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867"},{"name":"688","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/688"},{"name":"805","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/805"},{"name":"803","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/803"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"798","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/798"},{"name":"732","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/732"},{"name":"845","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/845"},{"name":"652","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/652"},{"name":"837","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/837"},{"name":"861","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/861"},{"name":"963","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/963"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"876","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/876"},{"name":"973","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/973"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"918","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/918"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Specialist (rank)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialist_(rank)"},{"name":"Universal Character Set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set"},{"name":"Unified Wine & Grape Symposium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Wine_&_Grape_Symposium"},{"name":"Kappa (folklore)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)"},{"name":"Boeing 767","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
