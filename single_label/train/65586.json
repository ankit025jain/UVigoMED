{"id":65586,"title":"Aquaporin-1 protein levels elevated in fresh urine of renal cell carcinoma patients: potential use for screening and classification of incidental renal lesions.","abstract":"There are over 65,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) each year, yet there is no effective clinical screening test for RCC. A single report claimed no overlap between urine levels of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in patients with and without RCC (Mayo Clin Proc. 85:413, 2010). Here, we used archived and fresh RCC patient urine to validate this report.Archived RCC, fresh prenephrectomy RCC, and non-RCC negative control urines were processed for Western blot analysis. Urinary creatinine concentrations were quantified by the Jaffe reaction (Nephron 16:31, 1976). Precipitated protein was dissolved in 1x SDS for a final concentration of 2? ?g/ÂµL creatinine.Negative control and archived RCC patient urine failed to show any AQP1 protein by Western blot analysis. Fresh RCC patient urine is robustly positive for AQP1. There was no signal overlap between fresh RCC and negative control, making differentiation straightforward.Our data confirms that fresh urine of patients with RCC contains easily detectable AQP1 protein. However, archival specimens showed an absence of detectable AQP1 indistinguishable from negative control. These findings suggest that a clinically applicable diagnostic test for AQP1 in fresh urine may be useful for detecting RCC.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803718","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.792736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.427343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.411315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0417838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Aquaporin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin"},{"name":"Aquaporin 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin_1"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Archive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Jaffe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffe"},{"name":"1x","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1x"},{"name":"Sodium dodecyl sulfate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
