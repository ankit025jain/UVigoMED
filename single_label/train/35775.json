{"id":35775,"title":"Clinical predictors of a positive genetic test in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Brazilian population.","abstract":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic autosomal dominant disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy. The molecular diagnosis is important but still expensive. This work aimed to find clinical predictors of a positive genetic test in a Brazilian tertiary centre cohort of index cases with HCM.In the study were included patients with HCM clinical diagnosis. For genotype x phenotype comparison we have evaluated echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and nuclear magnetic resonance measures. All patients answered a questionnaire about familial history of HCM and/or sudden death. ?-myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C, and troponin T genes were sequenced for genetic diagnosis.The variables related to a higher probability of a positive genetic test were familial history of HCM, higher mean heart frequency, presence of NSVT and lower age. Probabilities of having a positive molecular genetic test were calculated from the final multivariate logistic regression model and were used to identify those with a higher probability of a positive molecular diagnosis.We developed an easy and fast screening method that takes into account only clinical data that can help to select the patients with a high probability of positive genetic results from molecular sequencing of Brazilian HCM patients.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
