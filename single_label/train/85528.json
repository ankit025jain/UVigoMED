{"id":85528,"title":"The effects of a displayed cognitive aid on non-technical skills in a simulated 'can't intubate, can't oxygenate' crisis.","abstract":"Guidelines outlining recommended actions are difficult to implement in the stressful, time-pressured situation of an airway emergency. Cognitive aids such as posters and algorithms improve performance during some anaesthetic emergencies; however, their effects on team behaviours have not been determined. In this study, 64 participants were randomly assigned into control (no cognitive aid) and intervention (cognitive aid provided) groups before a simulated 'can't intubate, can't oxygenate' scenario. Video analysis was undertaken of the non-technical skills and technical performance during the scenarios. All categories had higher Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) scores when a cognitive aid was supplied (mean (SD) total ANTS score 10.4 (3.1) vs. 13.2 (2.4), p < 0.001). The number of times the cognitive aid was used was associated with higher ANTS scores (? = 0.383, p = 0.002). A trend towards the establishment of an infraglottic airway within 3 min was also noted (control group 55.3% vs. intervention 76.9%, p = 0.076). Non-technical skills are improved when a cognitive aid is present during airway emergencies.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917333","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.0853846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Oxygenate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenate"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Number_Theory_Symposium"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Wiktionary","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Poster","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster"}]}
