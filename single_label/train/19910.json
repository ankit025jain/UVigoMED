{"id":19910,"title":"Sepsis, mitochondrial failure and multiple organ dysfunction.","abstract":"The purpose of this review is to consider the state of oxidative stress, failure of the antioxidant systems and mitochondrial failure as the main physiopathological mechanisms leading to multiple organ dysfunction during sepsis.Sepsis is a clinical syndrome caused by a severe infection that triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response. Involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis are the activation of inflammatory, immune, hormonal, metabolic and bioenergetic responses. One of the pivotal factors in these processes is the increase of reactive species accompanied by the failure of the antioxidant systems, leading to a state of irreversible oxidative stress and mitochondrial failure. In a physiological state, reactive species and antioxidant systems are in redox balance. The loss of this balance during both chronic and infectious diseases leads to a state of oxidative stress, which is considered to be the greatest promoter of a systemic inflammatory response. The loss of the redox balance, together with a systemic inflammatory response during sepsis, can lead to progressive and irreversible mitochondrial failure, energy depletion, hypoxia, septic shock, severe sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction and death of the patient.Knowledge of the molecular processes associated with the development of oxidative stress should facilitate the development of effective therapies and better prognosis for patients with sepsis and organ dysfunction.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
