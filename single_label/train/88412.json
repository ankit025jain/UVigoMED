{"id":88412,"title":"Treatment of non-union of humerus diaphyseal fractures: a prospective study comparing interlocking nail and locking compression plate.","abstract":"The aim of this prospective comparative study was to compare outcomes and complications of humeral diaphyseal fracture non-unions managed with humerus interlocking nail (HIL) and locking compression plate (LCP).40 patients with non-union of humeral diaphyseal fractures were included in this study and were randomly allocated in two groups; group A had 20 cases treated with HIL and group B had 20 cases treated with LCP. Clinico-radiological assessments were done for each case up to 2-year follow-up period. Primary outcome measures (time to fracture union, union rate) and secondary outcome measures (functional outcome and complication such as infection, malunion, delayed union, implant failure, joint stiffness and iatrogenic radial nerve palsy) were compared between both the groups. Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scoring and Steward and Hundley's scoring system were used to assess functional outcome of the fracture fixation.There was no significant difference (p = 0.12) in terms of mean fracture union time between group A (15.8 ± 4.2 weeks) and group B (17.2 ± 3.8 weeks). Group A had 95 % union rate and group B had 100 % union rate (p = 0.14). At the 2-year follow-up visit, there was no significant difference found between both the groups regarding range of motion of shoulder and elbow joint. There was no significant difference found in final functional outcomes between both the groups on comparing DASH score (p = 0.14) and Steward and Hundley's score (p = 0.08). In terms of complications, there was insignificant difference found between both the groups.This study concludes that both the implants can be used in non-union of humeral shaft fractures with good functional outcomes and acceptable rate of complications.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853958","annotations":[{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.820708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.782746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.67052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Joint stiffness","weight":0.401611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_stiffness"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.286819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.26988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.26113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.118004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wrist drop","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist_drop"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rugby union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"},{"name":"Axle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Defensive back","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back"},{"name":"Interlocking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocking"},{"name":"Joint lock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_lock"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Saab 17","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_17"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Head coach","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"},{"name":"HIL bus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIL_bus"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
