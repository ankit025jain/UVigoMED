{"id":42842,"title":"Different expression of glucose transporters in the progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","abstract":"Glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 is expressed in malignant tumors and correlated with poor outcome in several cancers. Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) is considered to be a precursor or a noninvasive lesion of invasive cholangiocarcinoma. We examined GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 expression in 149 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 39 BilINs immunohistochemically and evaluated their correlation with clinicopathological findings and patient outcome in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Furthermore, we examined the role of GLUT-1 on migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells using GLUT-1 siRNA. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, GLUT-1 expression was frequently observed near the necrotic areas, whereas GLUT-2 expression tended to be observed in adenocarcinoma of large bile ducts. Compared with the GLUT-1-negative group, the GLUT-1-positive group showed significantly larger tumor size (P = .0031), poor differentiation (P < .0001), frequent lymphatic invasion (P = .0031) and lymph node metastasis (P < .0001), and high HIF-1? expression (P = .0297). GLUT-2 expression was significantly correlated with good differentiation (P = .0015), perihilar location (P < .0001), perineural invasion (P = .0049), and lymph node metastasis (P = .0248). The patients with GLUT-1-positive tumors showed poor disease related survival (P < .0001). The numbers of migrating and invading cells were significantly decreased in GLUT-1 siRNA transfectants of cholangiocarcinoma cells. Although, GLUT-1 was expressed in all grades of BilINs, GLUT-2 was expressed only in high-grade BilINs. Our results suggest that GLUT-1 expression correlates aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, and that GLUT-1 might be a therapeutic target of cholangiocarcinoma. GLUT-2 expression may be associated with cholangiocarcinogenesis of large bile duct and is a helpful marker for detecting high-grade BilIN lesions in atypical bile ducts.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824030","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.835292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.350815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.190903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hilum of lung","weight":0.0899222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_of_lung"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
