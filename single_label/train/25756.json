{"id":25756,"title":"[Natural dynamics of blood pressure, body mass index and lipid levels in the elderly (the results of 17-year follow-up)].","abstract":"to study natural dynamics of mean levels of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (SAP, DAP), body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and triglycerides (TG) in elderly people using data of 17-year cohort prospective observation.Primary examination of a random sample of population was carried out in 1988-1991, reexamination in 2002-2005. Here we present results of examination of 1046 persons including 136 of older age group (mean age at reexamination 69.3 ± 3.2 years).During the period of observation mean values of SAP in the elder group increased from 140.66 ± 23.61 to 164.58 ± 31.80 mm Hg (+17.0%; p<0,001). Values of DAP in women also rose from 87.82 ± 13.12 to 90.58 ± 13.69 mm Hg (+3.2%; p=0.029) while they did not change in the same age men. IMT values decreased from 28.78 ± 4.91 to 28.22 ± 5.17 kg/m² (-1.9%; p = 0.049). There was no dynamics of mean TC levels, while mean HDLC level lowered from 1.44 ± 0.35 to 1.29+0.34 mmol/l (-7.7%; p<0.001). Mean TG levels rose from 1.40 ± 0.78 to 1.73+1.0 mmol/I (+23.6%; p=0.002).The following changes occurred between 2 examinations of elderly persons performed with interval of 17 years: elevation of SAP, elevation of DAP in women, lowering of HDLC and BMI, elevation TG. There were no changes of TC.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177781","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass
