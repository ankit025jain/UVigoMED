{"id":32982,"title":"Ross procedure for patient with Marfan syndrome.","abstract":"The most prominent long-term complication after the Ross procedure is the risk of autograft dilatation, and therefore its application in patients at increased perceived risk of autograft dilatation (those with bicuspid aortic valve disease, aortic insufficiency [AI] with dilated aorta, collagen vascular diseases such as Marfan syndrome) has been discouraged. We reported a modified Ross procedure in 2005 in which the autograft was completely encased in a polyester graft before implantation to prevent further dilatation of the autograft. This case report describes follow-up of a patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent this modified Ross procedure in JulyÂ 2005.
