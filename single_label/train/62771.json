{"id":62771,"title":"Treatment of pruritus in early-stage hypopigmented mycosis fungoides with aprepitant.","abstract":"Pruritus is a symptom that significantly affects the patient's quality of life in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). The most effective treatments are those that address the condition itself; however, it is often not possible to control this symptom. Lymphoma-related pruritus normally becomes more severe as CTCL progresses, constituting an important factor for quality of life in these patients. Substance P is a neuromodulator which appears to play a key role in pruritus. Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist affecting the substance P receptor. So far, several cases have been documented with an antipruritic response to the drug aprepitant in advanced-stage mycosis fungoides (MF). In this paper, we describe an excellent response to aprepitant in a female patient with severe pruritus secondary to hypopigmented stage I MF. We would also like to stress the absence of nausea and vomiting of this combined therapy of interferon and aprepitant. Aprepitant could improve tolerance to interferon.
