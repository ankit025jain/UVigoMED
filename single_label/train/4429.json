{"id":4429,"title":"[Efficacy of nocodazole et experimental invasion Echinococcus granulosus of white mice].","abstract":"The therapeutic activity of subcutaneous and intraperitoneal nocodazole injections was studied in albino mice with experimental E. granulosus invasion. The animals were intraperitoneally infected with Echinococcus larval cysts (ELC) from a spontaneously inoculated sheep. Nocodazole aqueous suspension (NAS) was administered at the late stage of invasion in two experiments. In one experiment, the treatment was initiated 7.5 months after inoculation. The animals were given daily subcutaneous injections of gradually increasing daily doses (n = 32) from 5 to 20 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 months (the total active ingredient dose was 400 mg/kg). The mice were dissected 3 months after treatment termination. Their autopsy showed that all ELCs or their vast majority were dead in 17 (70.8%) of 24 NAS-treated mice. Among the completely cured mice, there were animals having dead ELCs amounting to 36.9% of the host's weight. In the other experiment, the mice received intraperitoneal treatment 11.5 months after inoculation. They were given NAS injections (n = 2-8) in the total active ingredient dose of 14-126 mg/kg for 4-32 days. The animals were dissected 12-14 months after inoculation. All the detected ELCs were ascertained to be dead in the mice that had received NAS in an active ingredient dose of 87-126 mg/kg and had been dissected 33-81 days after initiation of treatment. The damaging effect of NAS was accompanied by obvious ELC collapse (the ELC collapse index was 57.5-75.9% for all the cured animals).","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296427","annotations":[{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.740648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.586964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.570614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.266338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Echinococcus granulosus","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Active ingredient","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Nocodazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocodazole"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"1214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1214"},{"name":"United States National Academy of Sciences","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Early Learning Centre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Learning_Centre"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"}]}
