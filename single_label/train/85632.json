{"id":85632,"title":"Segmental resection for the treatment of congenital pulmonary malformations.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes of segmental resection to lobectomy as increasing antenatal diagnosis of congenital pulmonary malformations has led to a shift in surgical management.A retrospective institutional review for patients undergoing surgical excision of congenital pulmonary malformations was performed.Sixty-two patients with congenital pulmonary malformations were reviewed between 2001 and 2012. Forty-five were included for analysis. Malformations were subdivided into two groups, including congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) (n=11, 24%) and intrapulmonary (IP) lesions (n=34, 76%). Nineteen (56%) IP patients underwent segmental resection, and 15 (79%) were performed thoracoscopically without conversion to thoracotomy. None of these patients had recurrent disease. Lobectomy was performed in 11 (100%) CLE and 15 (44%) IP patients, and the majority were by thoracotomy. Median hospital stay was longer for the lobectomy group at 7days when compared to the segmentectomy group at 2days (p<0.001). There was not a difference in complication rate (21% vs. 19%, p=1.000) or in median number of chest tube days (2 vs. 3days, p=0.079) for segmentectomy versus lobectomy patients.Segmental resections of congenital pulmonary malformations can be performed safely while conserving healthy lung tissue.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888832","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Chest tube","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_tube"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.774952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.652446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.604126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.534199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.306299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.227075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Secondary bronchus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_bronchus"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
