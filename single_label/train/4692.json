{"id":4692,"title":"Oral health conditions and behaviors among hearing impaired and normal hearing college students at Ratchasuda College, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.","abstract":"This study aimed to explore oral health and oral health related behaviors among hearing impaired and normal hearing students at Rachasuda College. The association between socioeconomic factors, hearing status, oral health behaviors, oral hygiene levels and dental caries status were also examined. The students filled out a self-administered questionnaire with assistance of a sign language video to obtain personal and behavior information. A total of 180 students, 83 normal hearing and 97 hearing impaired students completed the questionnaire and underwent an oral examination. The prevalences of caries were 53.6% and 50.6% among students with hearing impairment and normal hearing, respectively (p=0.354). After age stratification, the hearing impaired students aged 18-21 years had significantly less filled teeth (p=0.012), and those older than 21 years had less missing teeth due to caries than normal-hearing students (p=0.023). Poor oral hygiene was found in 51.8% and 42.2% of normal and hearing-impaired students, respectively (p=0.365). Caries status was significantly associated with maternal education level (OR 3.56; 95% CI: 1.52-8.32) and oral hygiene (OR 3.26; 95% CI: 1.64-6.45). The high prevalence of dental caries and poor oral hygiene among college students is alarming. Hearing impairment did not appear to affect the prevalences of these conditions compared to those with normal hearing. Oral health education tools need to be developed and utilized for both normal hearing and hearing impaired college students in Thailand.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417527","annotations":[{"name":"Sign language","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.677765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.625628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.37023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.303234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.263889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.237943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.165579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1821","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1821"},{"name":"646","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/646"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"Signage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signage"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Maternal health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health"}]}
