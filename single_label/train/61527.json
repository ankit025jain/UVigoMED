{"id":61527,"title":"Outcome for children and young people with Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on a contemporary protocol, UKALL 2003.","abstract":"We investigated the outcome for children and young people with Early T-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP-ALL), a recently described poor prognosis sub-group of T-ALL, treated on a contemporary protocol, UKALL 2003. After a median follow-up of 4 years and 10 months, the ETP sub-group, representing 16% of T-ALL patients, had non-significantly inferior 5-year event-free survival (76·7% vs. 84·6%, P = 0·2) and overall survival (82·4% vs. 90·9%, P = 0·1), and a higher relapse rate (18·6% vs. 9·6%, P = 0·1) compared to typical T-ALL. ETP-ALL has an intermediate risk outcome, which does not warrant experimental treatment or first remission allogeneic transplant for the group universally.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708207","annotations":[{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.499231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.247918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.217419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0595559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/824"},{"name":"846","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/846"},{"name":"909","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Bird species new to science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_species_new_to_science"},{"name":"Parachute Troops School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_Troops_School"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Boeing 767","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
