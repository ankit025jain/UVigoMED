{"id":78190,"title":"Using functional assessment to treat behavior problems of deaf and hard of hearing children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.","abstract":"A defining feature of autism spectrum disorders is atypical behaviors, e.g., stereotypy, noncompliance, rituals, and aggression. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals with autism present a greater challenge because of additional issues related to their hearing status. One conceptualization of problem behavior is that it serves a communication function, i.e., the person has learned that certain misbehaviors may be reinforced in some way. The present article describes \"functional behavior assessment,\" a group of state-of-the-art methodologies that allow a caregiver to determine the cause of the behavior, so that treatment--based on that cause--will be more effective. Different methods of functional assessment are described, along with a step-by-step implementation sequence. The results of a functional assessment should lead to more effective programming, resulting in quicker elimination of the behavioral concerns, and allow the person to gain access to greater independence and more reinforcement.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745109","annotations":[{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Stereotypy","weight":0.712945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ritual","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.616243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.48721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.170044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.147891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.0631725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Anti-social behaviour","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
