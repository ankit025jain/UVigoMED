{"id":80111,"title":"[Analysis of highly cited schistosomiasis related papers from 2005 to 2012].","abstract":"To reveal the research focus of schistosomiasis in China through analyzing highly cited schistosomiasis related papers in journals from 2005 to 2012, so as to provide the information for formulating the plan of selecting topics of the editors.The published articles related to schistosomiasis in CNKI from 2005 to 2012 were collected, the citation frequency of the papers was calculated according to formula, and the highly cited papers were selected according to the citation frequency. Then the information of highly cited papers including the published time, type, author and author affiliation, citation frequency, journal, grant and research item, research status and development tendency were analyzed.A total of 3 639 published papers related to schistosomiasis were searched and 343 papers (the citation frequency > or = 8) were selected as highly cited papers, and Chinese Journal of Schistosomiasis Control shared 45.19% of them. Among these papers, original articles, reviews and special reports occupied 44.90%, 12.54% and 6.12%, respectively. The first authors of these papers were mainly from centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs) (17.33%), research institutions (22.67%) and colleges/universities (36.00%). Totally 50.44% of the articles received financial supports from research funds/foundations, and most of them were national or provincial funds. The research hotspots focused on epidemiology and prevention, epidemic situation analysis, vaccine, immunologic diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, immunity and infection.The highly cited papers related to schistosomiasis are mainly from CDCs, institutions and colleges/universities. The research hotspots mainly focus on epidemiology and prevention, vaccine, immunology and pharmaceutical study. The related journals can use this information to chose topic and solicit contributions to improve their influence.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800559","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.787868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"China","weight":0.716893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.527552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.322559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical sciences","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_sciences"},{"name":"Grant (money)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(money)"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Research institute","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_institute"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0431483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"Control engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Citation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
