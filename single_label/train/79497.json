{"id":79497,"title":"Endoscopic partial medial maxillectomy with mucosal flap for maxillary sinus mucoceles.","abstract":"To describe a technique of endoscopic medial maxillectomy with mucosal flap for postoperative maxillary sinus mucoceles and to present a case series of subjects who underwent this procedure.This case series includes four subjects with postoperative maxillary sinus mucoceles who underwent resection via endoscopic partial medial maxillectomy with a mucosal flap. We will discuss the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, operative details, and outcomes.Four subjects are included in this study. The average age at the time of medial maxillectomy was 52 years (range 35-65 years). Three subjects (75%) were female. One subject (25%) had bilateral postoperative maxillary sinus mucoceles. Two subjects (50%) had unilateral right sided mucoceles, and the remaining subject had a unilateral left sided mucocele. All subjects had a history of multiple sinus procedures for chronic sinusitis including Caldwell-Luc procedures ipsilateral to the postoperative mucocele. All subjects underwent endoscopic medial maxillectomy without complication and were symptom free at the last follow up appointment, average 24 months (range 3-71 months) after medial maxillectomy.For postoperative maxillary sinus mucoceles in locations that are difficult to access via the middle meatus antrostomy, we recommend endoscopic medial maxillectomy with mucosal flap. Our preliminary experience with four subjects demonstrates complete resolution of symptoms after this procedure.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411137","annotations":[{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.889631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.768176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.682628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Middle nasal meatus","weight":0.527016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_nasal_meatus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.341571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mucous cyst of the oral mucosa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_cyst_of_the_oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Meatus","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatus"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
