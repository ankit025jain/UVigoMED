{"id":43312,"title":"[Effect of antisense miR-224 on gastric cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis].","abstract":"To observe the effects of miR-224 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) on the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and vivo.The expression of miR-224 in the cancer tissues and their adjacent tissues in 120 gastric cancer patients were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The biological effects of miR-224 ASO on human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells was assessed by MTT assay, clone formation assay, flow cytometry and in vivo experiment in nude mice.Compared with the control group (0.50 ± 0.07), miR-224 ASO significantly reduced the miR-224 mRNA expression in the cancer patients (0.09 ± 0.01, P < 0.05). MTT assay results showed that the survival rate of gastric cells at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h was 53.6%, 59.1% and 70.1% in the miR-224 ASO group, and 12.3%, 17.4% and 24.7%, respectively, in the control group (P < 0.05 for all). Clone formation assay revealed that clone formation rate in the miR-224 ASO group was (5.33 ± 0.74)%, significantly lower than the (33.33 ± 8.38)% in the control group (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry indicated that the apoptotic index was (15.68 ± 1.46)% in the miR-224 ASO group and (3.36 ± 0.88)% in the control group (P < 0.01). In addition, the expressions of Bcl2 mRNA and protein were 1.05 ± 0.04 and 0.21 ± 0.03 in the miR-224 ASO group, significantly lower than that in the control group (4.87 ± 0.96 and 0.88 ± 0.09, P < 0.01). The in vivo study further showed that the tumor volume in the experimental group is significantly smaller than that in the control group (P = 0.01).MiR-224 is overexpressed in human gastric cancer. Reducing the expression of miR-224 can effectively inhibit the growth and promote apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. miR-224 may become a new target for the regulation of gene expression in gastric cancer.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796455","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.82371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Sense (molecular biology)","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.664748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.337115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.24261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Allele-specific oligonucleotide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele-specific_oligonucleotide"}]}
