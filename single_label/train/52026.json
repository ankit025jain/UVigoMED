{"id":52026,"title":"Study design of the Maycoba Project: obesity and diabetes in Mexican Pimas.","abstract":"To focus on the rationale and methods of the Maycoba Project.Study population included Mexican Pima Indians (MPI) and Blancos aged ?20-years, living in the village of Maycoba and surrounding area. Surveys in 1995 and 2010 included a medical history, biochemical and anthropomet- ric measurements. Additionally, socio- economic, physical activity, and dietary interviews were conducted. The 2010 study incorporated investigations on type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity-associated genetic alleles and human-envi- ronment changes.The study results are limited to demographic data and description of the eligible and ex- amined sample.This study may yield important information on T2D and obesity etiology in a traditional population exposed to environmental changes.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636033","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.789717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.741106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.558725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.50132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.310833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.159228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"National Party (Uruguay)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(Uruguay)"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Eric","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric"},{"name":"Message Passing Interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Municipal corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"},{"name":"Pima people","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pima_people"},{"name":"Douglas T2D","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_T2D"}]}
