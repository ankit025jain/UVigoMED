{"id":19160,"title":"Single-stage internal fixation for thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis using 4 different surgical approaches.","abstract":"A retrospective study was conducted on 148 spinal tuberculosis (TB) patients (M:F, 92:56; mean age, 39.7±12.3; range, 16-74 y) treated with anterior debridement and bone graft fusion with nail and screw internal fixation (nails+screws group); posterior pedicle screw fixation (pedicle screw group); vertebral arch pedicle internal fixation through a posterior route (posterior arch fixation group); or posterior debridement, bone graft fusion, and vertebral arch pedicle internal fixation (arch fixation group).We investigated 4 variant surgical approaches for internal fixation of spinal TB.The effectiveness of single-stage surgical fixation for different degrees of spinal TB is a matter of debate.Operation time and bleeding volume were recorded. Complications, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were examined preoperatively and 6 months after surgery.Overall, 78, 48, 16, and 6 patients underwent nails+screws, pedicle screws, arch fixation, and posterior arch fixation approaches, respectively. The mean operation times were 175.8±48.8, 308.5±76.7, 143.8±43.0, and 398.3±90.8, respectively (P<0.01). Mean blood transfusion volumes were 1227.1±988.2, 1771.7±794.7, 467.7±123.3, and 2833.3±1083.8 mL, respectively (P<0.01). Primary wound healing was achieved in 127 patients. No patients experienced spinal TB recurrence or failure of bone graft or fixation. All groups achieved significantly improved C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but significantly improved ASIA scores were only observed in the nails+screws and pedicle screw groups (P<0.01).Surgical approach limitations and advantages should be considered based on the position and severity of spinal TB infection to maximize functional outcomes and minimize surgical risks.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739228","annotations":[{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.895217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.62417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.517123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.462569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.315729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.278019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.260273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pott disease","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pott_disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.156579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.110557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
