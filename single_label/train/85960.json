{"id":85960,"title":"High intensity positive pressure ventilation and long term pulmonary function responses in severe stable COPD. A delicate and difficult balance.","abstract":"Method to improve minute ventilation (MV) during spontaneous breathing (SB) in stable severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a great clinical relevant in long term outcome. In this scenario, recommendations of early use of high-Intensity non-invasive Positive pressure Ventilation (HI-NPPV) or intelligent Volume Assured Pressure (iVAP) Support in Hypercapnic COPD have been proposed by safe therapeutics options. We analyze in this letter, Ekkernkamp et al. study that described the effect of HI-NPPV compared with SB on MV in patients receiving long-term treatment. We consider that interpretation of relationships between ABG, functional parameters, and respiratory mechanics reported need clarifications. Further prospective large clinical trials identifying the best mode of ventilation according to the characteristics in severe stable COPD are necessary to balance an effective approach and response on clinical symptoms and long-term effects.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832763","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.385304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Positive pressure ventilation","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_pressure_ventilation"},{"name":"Respiratory physiology","weight":0.0489124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_physiology"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Respiratory minute volume","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_minute_volume"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Alticor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alticor"},{"name":"Positive pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_pressure"},{"name":"Sufficiency of disclosure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficiency_of_disclosure"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
