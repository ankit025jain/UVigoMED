{"id":18002,"title":"Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Juniperus excelsa M.Bieb. growing wild in Lebanon.","abstract":"The essential oils (EOs) isolated from the leaves and twigs of Juniperus excelsa M.Bieb. growing wild in Lebanon were characterized, and their antimicrobial activity and antiradical capacity were evaluated. The EOs were obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus and characterized by GC and GC/MS analyses. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determining minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative bacterium, a yeast, and a dermatophyte with the broth microdilution technique. A total of 28 constituents was identified and accounted for 90.1 and 95.6% of the twig and leaf EO composition, respectively. Both EOs were essentially composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons (46.7 and 59.6% for twig and leaf EOs, resp.) and sesquiterpenes (39.4 and 32.1%, resp.). The main components were ?-pinene, ?-cedrol, and ?-car-3-ene. The J. excelsa EOs did not show any antiradical potential, but revealed interesting in vitro antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Trichophyton rubrum (MICs of 64 and 128 ?g/ml, resp.). The three major compounds were tested separately and in combination according to their respective amounts in the oil. ?-Car-3-ene was the most active component and is undoubtedly one of the constituents driving the antifungal activity of J. excelsa essential oil, even though synergies are probably involved.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827694","annotations":[{"name":"Monoterpene","weight":0.948051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoterpene"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.718984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Pinene","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinene"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.583707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Lebanon","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"},{"name":"Sesquiterpene","weight":0.378002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquiterpene"},{"name":"Juniper","weight":0.360164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper"},{"name":"Dermatophyte","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophyte"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.232029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Empirical formula","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_formula"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Trichophyton rubrum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichophyton_rubrum"},{"name":"Trichophyton","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichophyton"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Twig","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twig"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"}]}
