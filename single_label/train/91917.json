{"id":91917,"title":"Hot topics in biomechanically directed fracture fixation.","abstract":"The evolution of locking plates and modern nail constructs provides the orthopaedic trauma surgeon with a myriad of options with regard to implant selection for common fractures. There is a significant amount of biomechanical literature comparing modern constructs with those conventionally used. A basic understanding of this literature is required to make informed decisions with regard to implant selection in the management of these injuries. This article reviews the most recent biomechanical literature regarding implant selection and application for a variety of commonly treated injuries, including fractures of the clavicle, proximal humerus, distal humerus, intertrochanteric hip region, distal femur, and bicondylar tibial plateau.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464098","annotations":[{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.81126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.745098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.730216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.671996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.636088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.445168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Trauma surgery","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_surgery"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.149875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Myriad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Western Lombard literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Lombard_literature"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"}]}
