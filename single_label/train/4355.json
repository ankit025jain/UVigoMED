{"id":4355,"title":"[Sampling survey of schistosomiasis prevention knowledge among middle school students in endemic areas of Hubei Province].","abstract":"To understand the schistosomiasis prevention knowledge of middle school students from areas with different endemic levels in Hubei Province.The schistosomiasis endemic regions were divided into transmission controlled areas and endemic controlled areas in Hubei Province, middle school students from different types of areas were selected through stratified randomized cluster sampling and were investigated by questionnaire.A total of 3,204 students were selected and investigated. The awareness rate of schistosomiasis prevention and control knowledge among the students ranged from 65.1%-90.3%. Overall, the students from endemic controlled areas had higher knowledge rates of all the items than those from transmission controlled areas (all P <0.05). The middle school students acquired schistosomiasis prevention knowledge mainly from the teachers, parents, doctors and schistosomiasis staff.Health education to students should adopt different ways targeting at different endemic levels in the future.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434154","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.262651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"School","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.153015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Cluster sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
