{"id":83891,"title":"Anti-inflammatory effect of pyroglutamyl-leucine on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.","abstract":"Food-derived peptides have been reported to yield a variety of health promoting activities. Pyroglutamyl peptides are contained in the wheat gluten hydrolysate. In the present study, we investigated the effect of pyroglutamyl dipeptides on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in macrophages.RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS and various concentrations of pyroglutamyl-leucine (pyroGlu-Leu), -valine (pyroGlu-Val), -methionine (pyroGlu-Met), and -phenylalanine (pyroGlu-Phe). Cell viability/proliferation and various inflammatory parameters were measured by the established methods including ELISA and western blotting. The binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS to RAW 264.7 cells was also measured fluorescently.All the tested dipeptides significantly inhibited the secretion of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, and interleukin (IL)-6 from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Above all, pyroGlu-Leu inhibited the secretion of all these inflammatory mediators even at the lowest dose (200?g/ml). PyroGlu-Leu dose-dependently suppressed I?B? degradation and MAPK (JNK, ERK, and p38) phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. On the other hand, it did not affect the binding of LPS to the cell surface.Our results indicated that pyroGlu-Leu inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory response via the blocking of NF-?B and MAPK pathways in RAW 264.7 macrophages.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25225121","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Valine","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.727132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.6622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Inflammatory mediators","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_mediators"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.402995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Gluten","weight":0.249893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
