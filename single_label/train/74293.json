{"id":74293,"title":"Malignant paraganglioma: a case report.","abstract":"A paraganglioma is a rare tumour composed of chromaffin cells. The malignant paraganglioma is a very rare presentation, diagnosed by local recurrence after total resection of primary mass or findings of distant metastasis. Recurrent paraganglioma developed in a 60 years old lady 10 years after first surgical resection. This time the patient presented with neck swelling as well as with vertebral metastases. The patient underwent radiotherapy and symptomatic improvement was there. We present the case to emphasize the role of imaging in early diagnosis, avoidance of complications of advanced disease and to make awareness among the physicians.
