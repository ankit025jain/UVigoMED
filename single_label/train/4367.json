{"id":4367,"title":"[Spatial-time cluster analysis of distribution of schistosomiasis in Jiangling County].","abstract":"To analyze the spatial-time distribution characteristics of schistosomiasis in Jiangling County, Hubei Province from 2006 to 2011.The surveillance data of schistosomiasis of Jiangling County from 2006 to 2011 were collected, and a spatial database was established. The spatial-time permutation cluster analysis was performed by SaTScan 9.1.1 to detect the spatial-time cluster areas of schistosomiasis, and a risk map was drawn by ArcGIS 10.0.Compared to 2006, the infection rates of human, cattle and Oncomelania hupensis snails decreased by 47.67%, 93.34% and 52.41%, respectively in 2011. The space-time permutation clustering analysis of the infection rates of human, cattle and snails showed 4, 3 and 4 clusters, respectively, and all the clustered areas were distributed in inner embankment areas.From 2006 to 2011, the schistosomiasis endemic situation presents a decline trend in Jiangling County. The detected cluster areas are the important areas for schistosomiasis control. The space-time permutation statistics could be used in the analysis of endemic situation of schistosomiasis.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434131","annotations":[{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.581468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.380204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.267041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Permutation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Jiangling County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangling_County"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"ArcGIS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS"},{"name":"Spatial database","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_database"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Levee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Computer cluster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
