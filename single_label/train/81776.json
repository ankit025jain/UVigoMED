{"id":81776,"title":"The state-of-the-art of ART restorations.","abstract":"ART is less anxiety- and pain-provoking than traditional restorative treatments; administration of local anaesthesia is rarely required. Systematic reviews have provided evidence of the high level of effectiveness of high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restoration in restoring single-surface cavities, both in primary and permanent posterior teeth, but its survival rates in restoring multiple-surface cavities in primary posterior teeth needs to be improved. Insufficient information is available regarding the survival rates of multiple-surface ART restorations in permanent teeth. Evidence from these reviews indicates no difference in the survival rates of single-surface high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restorations and amalgam restorations in primary and permanent posterior teeth.Where indicated, high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restorations can be used alongside traditional restorations. ART provides a much more acceptable introduction to dental restorative care than the traditional 'injection, drill and fill'.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839709","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.792442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.673635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.437275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.40545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Drill","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Amalgam (dentistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
