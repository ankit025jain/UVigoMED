{"id":77214,"title":"Optimal waist circumference cut-off values for identifying metabolic risk factors in middle-aged and elderly subjects in Shandong Province of China.","abstract":"To study the optimal waist circumference (WC) cut-off values for identifying metabolic risk factors in middle-aged and elderly subjects in Shandong Province of China.A total of 2,873 men and 5,559 women were included in this cross-sectional study. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was diagnosed according to the definition of Chinese Diabetes Society in 2004. The relation between WC and MetS was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The optimal WC cut-off values were identified using the area under the ROC curve and the different diagnostic criteria for central obesity were compared.The WC was the risk factor for MetS independent of BMI, blood glucose, blood lipid, and blood pressure. The optimal WC cut-off value was 83.8 cm and 91.1 cm for identifying MetS in women and men, respectively. Compared with 80 cm and 85 cm for women and men, 85 cm and 90 cm had a higher Youden index for identifying all metabolic risk factors and MetS in women and men.The appropriate WC cut-off value is 85 cm and 90 cm for identifying central obesity and MetS in women and men in Shandong Province of China.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827716","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.746876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.744119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"China","weight":0.668012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.619196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Shandong","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
