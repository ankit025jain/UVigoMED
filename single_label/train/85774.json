{"id":85774,"title":"Risk of pneumonia with inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting ?2 agonist therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster analysis.","abstract":"Pneumonia poses a significant risk in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but data are limited on the disease phenotypes most susceptible to pneumonia.Cluster analysis using a data-driven recursive partitioning algorithm was employed using baseline data from two pooled one-year randomized exacerbation trials (n=3,255) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol or vilanterol alone to identify distinct patient groups at greatest risk of pneumonia or serious (hospitalization or death) pneumonia.Five clusters were identified. Patients at greater risk of first pneumonia had more severe obstruction (forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity <46%) and either a body mass index <19 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio 7.8, 95% confidence interval 4.7-13.0; n=144) or a pneumonia history and greater comorbidities (hazard ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0-7.7; n=374) relative to the cluster with the lowest pneumonia risk (reference; n=1310). Multiple comorbidities and use of psychoanaleptics also contributed to an increased risk of pneumonia in more obstructed patients. Independent of cluster, use of inhaled corticosteroids was associated with pneumonia (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.25-2.84) and serious pneumonia (hazard ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.40-6.01).Cluster analysis can identify patient populations at risk for serious safety outcomes and inform risk management strategies to optimize patient management. The greatest risk for pneumonia was in subjects with multiple pneumonia risk factors.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855350","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.835128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.715555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.544304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.537583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.451722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.231211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Recursive partitioning","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_partitioning"},{"name":"Fluticasone","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluticasone"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
