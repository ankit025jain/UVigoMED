{"id":81168,"title":"The accumulation of macrophages expressing myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) and MRP14 in the spleen of BALB/cA mice during infection with Plasmodium berghei.","abstract":"Splenomegaly is one of the typical symptoms of malaria. However, the pathogenesis of splenic enlargement still remains unclear. Spleen is a major organ for clearance of malaria parasites, but excessive response to the parasites can lead to splenomegaly. Myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8 and MRP14 are expressed by myeloid cells and are regarded as marker proteins of an immature and inflammatory subtype of macrophage. Previous studies have demonstrated that accumulation of MRP8(+) and MRP14(+) macrophages is associated with the pathological changes associated with various inflammatory diseases. In order to elucidate whether MRP8(+) and MRP14(+) cells are also involved in splenomegaly during malaria, we investigated expression of MRP8 and MRP14 in the spleens of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. The MRP8 and MRP14 levels in the serum were analyzed by western blot, which confirmed that these proteins were elevated during infection compared with uninfected controls. Enlargement of the spleen was prominent at 7days of infection, and histological analysis of the spleens demonstrated deposition of malaria pigments and accumulation of mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the tissue revealed the accumulation of cells expressing MRP8 and MRP14. In addition, the locations of those cells overlapped with CD11b(+) cells in the red pulp. These results suggest that splenomegaly in malaria is partly due to the accumulation of MRP8(+) and MRP14(+) macrophages.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440297","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin alpha M","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin_alpha_M"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.815421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.725119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.520974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Myelocyte","weight":0.414809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte"},{"name":"Red pulp","weight":0.328623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pulp"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.325848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
