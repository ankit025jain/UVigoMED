{"id":72986,"title":"Malignant and benign lesions of the skeletal musculature.","abstract":"There are several tumors and tumorlike conditions with variable biological behavior that may involve the skeletal musculature. The aim of this work was to review different intramuscular lesions and to provide a classification of muscle lesions based on their radiological patterns as well as to provide as a pictorial essay the imaging characteristics of typical muscle lesions. Radiologically, intramuscular lesions can manifest as solid masses, liquid or semiliquid masses, fat-containing lesions, diffuse muscle enlargement, and muscle calcifications. Additionally, lesions with mixed patterns can also occur. It is noteworthy that different malignant or benign muscle lesions can manifest with identical radiological patterns.
