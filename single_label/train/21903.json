{"id":21903,"title":"Clinical predictors of port infections within the first 30 days of placement.","abstract":"To identify risk factors for port infections within 30 days of placement.A retrospective chart review of port placements from 2002-2009 was conducted. Patients who had port removals secondary to infection within the first 30 days of placement were included. This group of patients was compared with a control group of patients with ports with no evidence of infection. For every one patient with a port infection, two control subjects were chosen of the same gender and new port placement during the same month as the corresponding patient with an infected port.From 2002-2009, 4,404 ports were placed. Of the 4,404 patients, 33 (0.7%) were found to have a port infection within 30 days of placement. Compared with the control group, the early infection group had a higher prevalence of leukopenia (21.2% vs 6.1%, P = .039) and thrombocytopenia (33% vs 12%, P = .0158). There was also a higher prevalence of an inpatient hospital stay during port placement and high international normalized ratio in the early infection group.Low preoperative white blood cell and platelet counts were risk factors for early infection. Abnormal coagulation profiles and inpatient access of ports after placement could be additional risk factors.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581465","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.791023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.453138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.375769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.320845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.0193016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
