{"id":63072,"title":"Predictors of being overweight or obese in survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).","abstract":"A high prevalence of obesity has been increasingly recognized in survivors of pediatric ALL. However, longitudinal patterns of weight change during and after treatment, and associated factors, are less well elucidated.In a retrospective cohort of 83 pediatric patients with ALL diagnosed between 1985 and 2010, we examined body mass index (BMI) status at several key time points: diagnosis; end of induction; end of consolidation; every 6 months during maintenance; and yearly for up to 5 years post-treatment.At diagnosis, 21% were overweight (BMI = 85-94.9th percentile) or obese (BMI ? 95th percentile). At the end of treatment and 5 years post-treatment, approximately 40% were overweight or obese. The mean BMI z-score was 0.2 (58th percentile) at diagnosis and increased significantly during induction (? = 0.5, P < 0.0001). It increased again during the first 6 months of maintenance (? = 0.2, P < 0.01) and did not significantly change over the remainder of maintenance (BMI z-score at the end of treatment = 0.8, 79th percentile) and 5 years post-treatment (BMI z-score = 0.7, 76th percentile). High BMI z-score at diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of being overweight/obese at treatment completion (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.1). Weight gain during treatment was associated with being overweight/obese 5 years post-treatment (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.1-12.5).Children with ALL are at risk of becoming overweight/obese early in treatment. Increases in weight are maintained throughout treatment and beyond. Lifestyle interventions are needed targeting weight control early during treatment, particularly for patients overweight/obese at diagnosis and those who experience substantial weight gain during treatment.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482072","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.77722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.525161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.471407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.415673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.37766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.287571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.119376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Dieting","weight":0.0430459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Weight transfer (dance move)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_transfer_(dance_move)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"}]}
