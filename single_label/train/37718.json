{"id":37718,"title":"[Present status of expanded newborn screening project for inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry].","abstract":"In Japan, screening for six diseases including four inborn errors of metabolism has been performed since 1977 for all neonates to prevent severe mental handicaps or death. A rapid screening procedure for analysis of several amino acids and acylcarnitines in blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry was developed by Millington DS et al. in the early 1990s. Although it is called expanded (or extended) newborn screening, the procedure is insufficiently sensitive to or specific for several diseases. Screening for all diseases that can be screened using this procedure is suggested to be cost-ineffective. Many European countries target only two diseases: medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and phenylketonuria; their prevalence in Caucasian populations is very high, but some countries target more than twenty diseases and others an intermediate number. A pilot study targeting 22 diseases suggests that the combined incidence is one per 9,000 (0.01%) in Japan. This primary screening requires secondary screening to confirm the disease using urine, and either organic acids with solvent extraction or metabolome without fractionation are analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There is no need for primary or secondary screening tests to be performed at the same laboratory because the skills required are quite different. Understanding of the methodological problems of tandem mass screening and amelioration of variation and false positivity rate of this screening method among laboratories are critical to the success of the screening system in Japan. GC/MS-based urine metabolomics is expected to become one of the primary screening methodologies for neonates/infants who are already ill.
