{"id":46152,"title":"[Rapidly detect and distinguish between norovirus G I and G II type with a pair of primers].","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to develop RT- PCR assay for Rapidly detect and distinguish between Norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II with a pair of primers.A pairs of primers specific to capsid prote in ORF2 gene of G I and G II Norovirus were dsigned according to the published complete genome sequence, with which the RNA of Norovirus was extracted and RT-PCR amplification. The sensitivity, specificity of the RT- PCR assay was estimated and apply it to the detection of Norovirus in clinical specimens.The results showed that the assay possessed high specificity for Norovirus detection and without any evident cross-reaction with other viruses, including rotavirus, enteric adenovirus and hepatitis A virus. The detection limit of RT-PCR assay for Norovirus G I and G II were up to 100 pg/ml and 10 pg/ml respectively.The RT- PCR assay provide rapid and sensitive detection of Norovirus G I and G II and should prove to be useful for Norovirus diagnosis in the outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645329","annotations":[{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.82045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.804684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.347452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.321066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.272072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
