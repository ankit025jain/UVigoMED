{"id":38096,"title":"Newly described clinical features in two siblings with MACS syndrome and a novel mutation in RIN2.","abstract":"The disorder comprising Macrocephaly, Alopecia, Cutis laxa, and Scoliosis has been designated MACS syndrome. It is a rare condition, inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Three families from different ethnic origins have so far been reported and were all linked to homozygous mutations in RIN2, a gene encoding the Ras and Rab interactor 2 protein involved in cell trafficking. We describe herein the fourth family with MACS syndrome in two siblings carrying a novel homozygous mutation, c.1878_1879insC in exon 8 of the RIN2 gene, which predicts p.Ile627Hisfs*7. We also report on additional findings not previously described in MACS syndrome, including bronchiectasis and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Finally, our overall data support the argument that RIN2 syndrome is a more appropriate name for the disorder.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449201","annotations":[{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.886122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Macrocephaly","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocephaly"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bronchiectasis","weight":0.821218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiectasis"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.811935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.76131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.591357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Isoleucine","weight":0.221043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cutis laxa","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutis_laxa"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"}]}
