{"id":52014,"title":"High-dose vitamin D supplementation and measures of insulin sensitivity in polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized, controlled pilot trial.","abstract":"To determine the effects of high-dose vitamin D on insulin sensitivity in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Randomized, placebo-controlled trial.Academic medical center.Twenty-eight women with PCOS.Vitamin D3, 12,000 IU, or placebo daily for 12 weeks.The primary outcome was quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. Secondary outcomes included glucose and insulin levels during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and blood pressure.Twenty-two women completed the study. Compared with placebo, vitamin D significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D (mean [95% confidence interval] in vitamin D group 20.1 [15.7 to 24.5] ng/mL at baseline and 65.7 [52.3 to 79.2] ng/mL at 12 weeks; placebo 22.5 [18.1 to 26.8] ng/mL at baseline and 23.8 [10.4 to 37.2] ng/mL at 12 weeks). There were no significant differences in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and other measures of insulin sensitivity; however, we observed trends toward lower 2-hour insulin and lower 2-hour glucose. We also observed a protective effect of vitamin D on blood pressure.In women with PCOS, insulin sensitivity was unchanged with high-dose vitamin D, but there was a trend toward decreased 2-hour insulin and a protective effect on blood pressure.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636395","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.849269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.842398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.688431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.563131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.503602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.383206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.202857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.111503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
