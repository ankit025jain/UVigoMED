{"id":85424,"title":"Blood gas tensions in adult asthma: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis.","abstract":"The last half-century has seen substantial changes in asthma treatment and care. We investigated whether arterial blood gas parameters in acute and non-acute asthma have changed historically.We performed a systematic search of the literature for studies reporting P(aO2) , P(aCO2) and forced expiratory volume in 1?s, percentage of predicted (FEV1%). For each of the blood gas parameters, meta-regression analyses examined its association with four background variables: the publication year, mean FEV1%, mean age and female fraction in the respective studies.After screening, we included 43 articles comprising 61 datasets published between 1967 and 2013. In studies of habitual-state asthma, mean P(aO2) was positively associated with the publication year (p?=?0.001) and negatively with mean age (p?<?0.01). Mean P(aCO2) showed a positive association with publication year (p?=?0.001) and a negative association with female fraction (p?<?0.05). In acute asthma studies, blood gas levels were unassociated with publication year and mean age, mean P(aO2) was positively associated with FEV1% (p?<?0.05) whereas mean P(aCO2) showed a negative association with FEV1% (p?<?0.05) for studies with mean FEV1% <40. In neither acute nor habitual-state studies was mean arterial pH associated with any of the predictor variables.In studies of habitual-state asthma, mean reported P(aO2) and P(aCO2) levels were found to have increased since 1967. In acute asthma studies, mean P(aO2) and P(aCO2) were associated with mean FEV1% but not with either publication year or patient age.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945942","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.737704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.351631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.254836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.196227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.150838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
