{"id":43010,"title":"Expression of annexin A3 in gastric cancer and its correlation with proliferation and apoptosis.","abstract":"Annexin A3 has been identified as a novel biomarker in different types of cancers. However, little is known about its clinical significances and and biological roles in gastric cancer. In this study, we assessed annexin A3 expression in 80 patients with gastric cancer and explore its correlation with prognosis Moreover, correlations with Ki-67, Bcl-2 and Bax were also investigated. Expression of annexin A3 was increased in gastric cancer compared with that in normal gastric tissues. Annexin A3 expression was significantly associated with tumor volume and TNM stage (p<0.05). and inversely correlation with prognosis of patients. More interestingly, expression of annexin A3 was positive correlated with Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression. Our study showed annexin A3 might be a potential prognostic marker for gastric cancer and involved in tumorigenesis by regulating apoptosis and proliferation.
