{"id":30137,"title":"Beyond bricks and mortar: recent research on substance use disorder recovery management.","abstract":"Scientific advances in the past 15 years have clearly highlighted the need for recovery management approaches to help individuals sustain recovery from chronic substance use disorders. This article reviews some of the recent findings related to recovery management: (1) continuing care, (2) recovery management checkups, (3) 12-step or mutual aid, and (4) technology-based interventions. The core assumption underlying these approaches is that earlier detection and re-intervention will improve long-term outcomes by minimizing the harmful consequences of the condition and maximizing or promoting opportunities for maintaining healthy levels of functioning in related life domains. Economic analysis is important because it can take a year or longer for such interventions to offset their costs. The article also examines the potential of smartphones and other recent technological developments to facilitate more cost-effective recovery management options.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557873","annotations":[{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.651772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.486506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.323537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.136923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mortar (weapon)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Fisheries management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_management"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Carbon offset","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offset"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"General medical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_medical_examination"},{"name":"Continuing care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_care"},{"name":"Smartphone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Brick and mortar business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar_business"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Mutualism (biology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)"}]}
