{"id":50915,"title":"Massive pericardial effusion associated with hypothyroidism.","abstract":"The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is difficult because hypothyroidism in adults and especially the elderly, classic, has an insidious onset with a range of nonspecific symptoms which may delay diagnosis for months or even years. Old age seems to represent trigger factor for autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism. Clinical features in hypothyroidism, such as weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, edema and muscle weakness, and decreased osteo-tendinous reflexes are usually subtle and can be overlooked. Thyroid dysfunction may be associated with a negative impact on the cardiovascular system. Pericardial, pleural and peritoneal effusions are common findings in hypothyroidism. This case report represents a typical primary hypothyroidism (autoimmune) and shows the clinical features of this disease. Basically we talked about a severe myxedema with the involvement of internal organs in an elderly woman and the euthyroidism restoration, under thyroid replacement therapy, was correlated with the clinical improvement and cardiovascular and neurological status, with radiographic remission and regression to extinction of pericardial effusion at repeated echocardiographic evaluations.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System
