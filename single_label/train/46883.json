{"id":46883,"title":"Complications in surgery for Crohn's disease after preoperative antitumour necrosis factor therapy.","abstract":"The use of biological therapy (biologicals) is established in the treatment of Crohn's disease. This study aimed to determine whether preoperative treatment with biologicals is associated with an increased rate of complications following surgery for Crohn's disease with intestinal anastomosis.All patients receiving biologicals and undergoing abdominal surgery with anastomosis or strictureplasty were identified at six tertiary referral centres. Demographic data, and preoperative, operative and postoperative details were registered. Patients who were treated with biologicals within 2?months before surgery were compared with a control group who were not. Postoperative complications were classified according to anastomotic, infectious or other complications, and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.Some 111 patients treated with biologicals within 2?months before surgery were compared with 187 patients in the control group. The groups were well matched. There were no differences between the treatment and control groups in the rate of complications of any type (34·2 versus 28·9 per cent respectively; P?=?0·402), anastomotic complications (7·2 versus 8·0 per cent; P?=?0·976) and non-anastomotic infectious complications (16·2 versus 13·9 per cent; P?=?0·586). In univariable regression analysis, biologicals were not associated with an increased risk of any complication (odds ratio (OR) 1·33, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·81 to 2·20), anastomotic complication (OR 0·89, 0·37 to 2·17) or infectious complication (OR 1·09, 0·62 to 1·91).Treatment with biologicals within 2?months of surgery for Crohn's disease with intestinal anastomosis was not associated with an increased risk of complications.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615529","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.861562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.792776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.725541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.647956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.637615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.580082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.476873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.475509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.256854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.154283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Surgical anastomosis","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_anastomosis"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Strictureplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictureplasty"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
