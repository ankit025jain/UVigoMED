{"id":45256,"title":"An early-stage, non-hypervascular HCC successfully treated by superselective, bland transarterial embolization using 40-?m microspheres.","abstract":"Transcatheter embolization is considered to be less effective for early-stage hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) without a hypervascular arterial supply. In the present case report, a 65-year-old male with hepatitis type C and non-hypervascular HCC located in the hepatic hilum was successfully treated by bland transarterial embolization (TAE). After the temporary protective embolization of normal liver tissue using large gelatin particles, diluted 40-?m microspheres were injected via the tumor-feeding artery. The tumor shrank, and the patient has survived for 25 months without recurrence.
