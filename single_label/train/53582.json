{"id":53582,"title":"Sensitivity of diabetic retinopathy associated vision loss to screening interval in an agent-based/discrete event simulation model.","abstract":"To examine the effect of changes to screening interval on the incidence of vision loss in a simulated cohort of Veterans with diabetic retinopathy (DR). This simulation allows us to examine potential interventions without putting patients at risk.Simulated randomized controlled trial. We develop a hybrid agent-based/discrete event simulation which incorporates a population of simulated Veterans--using abstracted data from a retrospective cohort of real-world diabetic Veterans--with a discrete event simulation (DES) eye clinic at which it seeks treatment for DR. We compare vision loss under varying screening policies, in a simulated population of 5000 Veterans over 50 independent ten-year simulation runs for each group.Diabetic Retinopathy associated vision loss increased as the screening interval was extended from one to five years (p<0.0001). This increase was concentrated in the third year of the screening interval (p<0.01). There was no increase in vision loss associated with increasing the screening interval from one year to two years (p=0.98).Increasing the screening interval for diabetic patients who have not yet developed diabetic retinopathy from 1 to 2 years appears safe, while increasing the interval to 3 years heightens risk for vision loss.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508563","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.65,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.526802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.190117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.163318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0459474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diethylstilbestrol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol"},{"name":"Discrete event simulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Run (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)"},{"name":"Discrete time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0116827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"}]}
