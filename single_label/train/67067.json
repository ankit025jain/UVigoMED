{"id":67067,"title":"The short term effects of resveratrol on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat testis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to identify changes taking place in the rat testis at the 24th hour of reperfusion following testicular torsion and to evaluate the effects of resveratrol (RSV), a powerful antioxidant, in preventing these changes using novel biochemical parameters and histopathology.Eighteen adult male rats were divided into three groups: Sham-operated (S), torsion/detorsion (T/D), and T/D+RSV groups. In the T/D group, testicular ischemia was achieved by rotating the left testis 720Â° clockwise for 4h. In the T/D+RSV group, 20mg/kg RSV was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before detorsion. All rats were sacrificed 24h after detorsion. Serum and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, ischemia modified albumin (IMA), total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and histopathological damage score were analyzed.Serum MDA, IMA, TOS, and OSI levels rose significantly in the T/D group. Serum MDA and IMA values were lower in the T/D+RES groups, but not significantly. OSI and TOS values were lower in the T/D+RES group, and the difference was significant. TAS values decreased significantly in the T/D group and rose in the T/D+RSV group, but not significantly. Ipsilateral tissue MDA values were significantly elevated in the T/D group and decreased in the T/D+RSV group, but not significantly. Apoptosis and histopathological damage increased significantly in the T/D group and decreased significantly in the T/D+RSV group. In the contralateral testis, apoptosis increased significantly in the T/D group. It decreased significantly in the T/D+RSV group.Our findings show that RSV had a protective effect against oxidative damage induced with a testicular T/D model, especially at the antiapoptotic and histopathological level. OSI may be a good guide to the clinical status of testicular T/D.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650483","annotations":[{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.659555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.649401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.594855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.393917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.327776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0783422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Tasmania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Atari TOS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_TOS"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Torsion (gastropod)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(gastropod)"},{"name":"Revised Standard Version","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Standard_Version"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Clockwise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
