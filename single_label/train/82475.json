{"id":82475,"title":"Free flap reconstruction versus non-free flap reconstruction in treating elderly patients with advanced oral cancer.","abstract":"Our goal was to evaluate whether elderly patients can benefit from free flaps.The clinical information from the included patients was reviewed, and these patients were asked to complete the University of Washington Quality of Life, version 4, questionnaire. Comparisons of the different scales between the 2 groups were performed.The difference in the mouth-opening width before and after surgery did not differ significantly (P = .621) in the patients with and without free flap reconstruction. However, free flap placement tended to preserve the original mouth-opening width. No significant differences were found in recurrence-free survival or disease-specific survival between the 2 groups. The mean quality of life score of the 2 groups was 77.5 ± 10.4 and 72.1 ± 10.8. Significant differences were found in the chewing domain scores between the 2 groups (P = .039). Patients with free flap reconstruction tended to score better in the appearance and taste domains (P = .073 and P = .053, respectively); however, they required longer operative times, and longer postoperative hospital stays and incurred hospital costs.Free flap reconstruction did not benefit elderly patients in mouth-opening width or survival analyses; the only quality of life domain that was significantly improved in patients undergoing free flap reconstruction was chewing. Free tissue transfer should be cautiously suggested for elderly patients with advanced oral cancer.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613030","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.477373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"University of Washington","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Free (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_(band)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
