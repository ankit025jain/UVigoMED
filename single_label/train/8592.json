{"id":8592,"title":"Eprosartan improves cardiac function in swine working heart model of ischemia-reperfusion injury.","abstract":"Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used as an antihypertensive. We sought to evaluate the regional effect of Eprosartan on postinfarct ventricular remodeling and myocardial function in an isolated swine working heart model of ischemia-reperfusion injury.22 swine hearts were perfused with the Langendorff perfusion apparatus under standard experimental conditions. Myocardial ischemia was induced by a 10-min left anterior descending artery ligation. Hearts were reperfused with either saline (control group, n=11), or Eprosartan (treatment group, n=11). Left ventricular pressure (LVP) and regional heart parameters such as intramyocardial pressure (IMP), wall thickening rate (WTh), and pressure-length-loops (PLL) were measured at baseline and after 30 min of reperfusion.Measured parameters were statistically similar between the 2 groups at baseline. The administration of Eprosartan led to a significantly better recovery of IMP and WTh: 44.4±2.5 mmHg vs. 51.2±3.3 mmHg, p<0.001 and 3.8±0.4 µm vs. 4.4±0.3 µm, p=0.001, respectively. PLL were also significantly higher in the treatment group following reperfusion (21694±3259 units vs. 31267±3429 units, p<0.01). There was no difference in the LVP response to Eprosartan versus controls (63.6±3.0 mmHg vs. 62.5±3.1 mmHg, p=0.400).Pre-treatment with Eprosartan is associated with a significant improvement in regional cardiac function under ischemic conditions. Pharmacological treatment with eprosartan may exert a direct cardioprotective effect on ischemic myocardium.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762635","annotations":[{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor antagonist","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.840648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.781345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.709659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.473523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Ventricular remodeling","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_remodeling"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.164505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0719505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Eprosartan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eprosartan"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0197932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Ventricular pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_pressure"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Langendorff Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langendorff_Heart"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ligation","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligation"}]}
