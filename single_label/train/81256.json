{"id":81256,"title":"[Rehabilitation by composite prosthesis combining milling of embedded bilateral edentulous: a clinical report].","abstract":"The treatments with composite prosthesis require the completion of milling. These precision preparations in the fixed prosthesis promote the integration of removable partial denture with metallic framework in mechanical (prosthetic balance), physiological, aesthetical and psychological point of view. Their conception and realization are always subordinated to the balance principles of the removable partial denture. The precision they require need the use of a dental milling machine working along the predetermined insertion axis of the partial denture casting and require an excellent communication and a close collaboration between dentist and experienced technician of laboratory. In this paper, after a recalling about the milling (definition, description, interests), we will detail the steps to achieve clinical and laboratory needs for a rehabilitation by composite prosthesis combining milling, and it will be illustrated through a clinical case with a bilateral tooth-supported edentulous in the maxilla.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223144","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Milling machine","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_machine"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.173963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0730188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Technician","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technician"},{"name":"Removable partial denture","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_partial_denture"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Embedded system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
