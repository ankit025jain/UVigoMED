{"id":91534,"title":"[Analgesic and sedative effects of inhaling a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen on burn patient during and after dressing change].","abstract":"To investigate the analgesic and sedative effects of inhaling a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen on burn patient during and after dressing change.A total of 240 burn patients hospitalized in the Institute of Burn Research of Changhai Hospital Affiliated to the Second Military Medical University, Department of Burns of the First People's Hospital in Zhengzhou, and Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from October 2011 to September 2012 were enrolled in our study, and they were all in accordance with the inclusion criteria. The 240 patients were divided into control group (n = 60, treated with inhalation of oxygen during dressing change) and treatment group (n = 180, treated with inhalation of a mixture of 65% nitrous oxide and oxygen during dressing change) according to the computer-generated list of random number. The other treatments in control group and treatment group were the same. Before, during, and after dressing change, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), oxygen saturation (SO2), and adverse effects were observed. The degree of pain and anxiety felt by the patients were respectively evaluated with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Chinese version of the burn specific pain anxiety scale (C-BSPAS) at the same time points as above. Data were processed with analysis of covariance, chi-square test, analysis of variance, and rank sum test.There were no significant differences between control group and treatment group in the levels of HR, SBP, DBP, and SO2 before dressing change (with F values respectively 0.76, 0.06, 1.11, 0.70, P values all above 0.05). Compared with those of control group, the levels of HR, SBP, DBP, and SO2 in treatment group were significantly ameliorated during dressing change (with F values respectively 81.78, 146.36, 226.44, 205.62, P values all below 0.01). After dressing change, the levels of DBP in the two groups were close (F = 0.31, P > 0.05), but the levels of HR, SBP, and SO2 showed statistical differences (with F values respectively 7.02, 8.69, 12.23, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Before dressing change, the VAS scores were approximate between control group and treatment group (Z = 0.21, P > 0.05). Compared with those in control group (9.4 ± 0.7, 1.7 ± 2.5), the VAS scores were significantly lowered in treatment group during and after dressing change (1.6 ± 1.3, 0.7 ± 1.1, with Z values respectively 11.84, 3.35, P values all below 0.01). There was no significant difference in C-BSPAS score between control group and treatment group before dressing change (Z = 0.62, P > 0.05). Compared with those in control group (75 ± 13, 73 ± 12), the C-BSPAS scores in treatment group were decreased during and after dressing change (9 ± 15, 9 ± 14, with Z values respectively 11.91, 12.28, P values all below 0.01). There were no obvious adverse effects in two groups before, during, and after dressing change.A mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen seems to have obvious analgesic and sedative effects on burn patients during dressing change, and it can be widely used.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and
