No adverse effect was observed in group A, while in group B, varying degrees of nausea, vomiting, headache and dermatitis were observed in 29 cases, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) like polycystic ovary was observed in 14 cases under the B ultrasound.Acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking therapy has a better effect than clomiphene in the treatment of PCOS without any adverse effect.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494277","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Menstruation","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Clomifene","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.744401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","weight":0.558969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.506431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.462268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.39073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation","weight":0.196569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.108294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0236065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"}]}
