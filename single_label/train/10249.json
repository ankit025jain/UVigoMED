{"id":10249,"title":"Do all ?-blockers attenuate the excess hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization from the bone marrow following trauma/hemorrhagic shock?","abstract":"Severe injury results in increased mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) from the bone marrow (BM) to sites of injury, which may contribute to persistent BM dysfunction after trauma. Norepinephrine is a known inducer of HPC mobilization, and nonselective ?-blockade with propranolol has been shown to decrease mobilization after trauma and hemorrhagic shock (HS). This study will determine the role of selective ?-adrenergic receptor blockade in HPC mobilization in a combined model of lung contusion (LC) and HS.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to LC, followed by 45 minutes of HS. Animals were then randomized to receive atenolol (LCHS + ?1B), butoxamine (LCHS + ?2B), or SR59230A (LCHS + ?3B) immediately after resuscitation and daily for 6 days. Control groups were composed of naive animals. BM cellularity, %HPCs in peripheral blood, and plasma granulocyte-colony stimulating factor levels were assessed at 3 hours and 7 days. Systemic plasma-mediated effects were evaluated in vitro by assessment of BM HPC growth. Injured lung tissue was graded histologically by a blinded reader.The use of ?2B or ?3B following LCHS restored BM cellularity and significantly decreased HPC mobilization. In contrast, ?1B had no effect on HPC mobilization. Only ?3B significantly reduced plasma G-CSF levels. When evaluating the plasma systemic effects, both ?2B and ?3B significantly improved BM HPC growth as compared with LCHS alone. The use of ?2 and ?3 blockade did not affect lung injury scores.Both ?2 and ?3 blockade can prevent excess HPC mobilization and BM dysfunction when given after trauma and HS, and the effects seem to be mediated systemically, without adverse effects on subsequent healing. Only treatment with ?3 blockade reduced plasma G-CSF levels, suggesting different mechanisms for adrenergic-induced G-CSF release and mobilization of HPCs. This study adds to the evidence that therapeutic strategies that reduce the exaggerated sympathetic stimulation after severe injury are beneficial and reduce BM dysfunction.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662859","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem
