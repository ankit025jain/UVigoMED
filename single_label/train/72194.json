{"id":72194,"title":"Cellular and physiological roles for phospholipase D1 in cancer.","abstract":"Phospholipase D enzymes have long been proposed to play multiple cell biological roles in cancer. With the generation of phospholipase D1 (PLD1)-deficient mice and the development of small molecule PLD-specific inhibitors, in vivo roles for PLD1 in cancer are now being defined, both in the tumor cells and in the tumor environment. We review here tools now used to explore in vivo roles for PLD1 in cancer and summarize recent findings regarding functions in angiogenesis and metastasis.
