{"id":35422,"title":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, psychiatric indicators and quality of life: a systematic review.","abstract":"This study is aimed to conduct a systematic literature review regarding the associations between psychiatric symptoms, functional impairments, and quality of life in patients with CMT (Charcot-Marie-Tooth). The PUBMED, PsycInfo, SCIELO, and LILACS electronic databases were used, and the following search terms were employed: CMT, HMSN (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy), mental disorder, quality of life, psychiatry, psychiatric, and psychological without the use of time-limit filters. According to the adopted inclusion criteria, 20 studies were included and appraised. These studies indicated that patients with CMT exhibited an increased trend toward depressive symptoms compared with the general population. In addition, CMT patients were exposed to a higher risk of reduced quality of life and significant sleep impairment. Considering the comorbidity of CMT with other psychiatric disorders, the heterogeneity of the instruments used to evaluate the psychiatric symptoms compromised the ability to compare the studies examined. Our results indicate a need for a systematic evaluation of these conditions to minimize the impairments and decreased quality of life caused by CMT.
