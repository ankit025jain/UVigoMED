{"id":63779,"title":"Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and thrombocytosis without JAK2 V617F mutation: report of three cases.","abstract":"In the WHO classification, there is a provisional entity called Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Unclassifiable (MDS/MPN, U). Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) was included in this category. Recently published studies report a small percentage of patients with RARS-T. Sixty percent of these have JAK2 V617F mutation, which can suggest the coexistence of two pathological conditions (MDS and MPN). In this paper, we analyzed three patients diagnosed with RARS-T in the Department of Hematology, \"Fundeni\" Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania, during the period 2005-2011. The patients were investigated with cytogenetic exam and molecular biology. In these three cases were identified morphological features of multilineage dysplasia (two-lineage dysplasia in two cases and three-lineage dysplasia in one case). In two cases, thrombocytosis was under 1000×10(3)/?L and clinical evolution was similar to the myelodysplastic syndrome (transfusion dependent anemia with response to administration of erythropoietin). In the third case, the platelets were over 1000×10(3)/?L and with response to the treatment with Hydrea, which improved anemia. JAK2 V617F mutation was not identified in any case. RARS-T remains a provisional entity and requires a complex investigation of patients for the correct diagnosis of these patients. Therapeutic options should be personalized to each case in part because there is not yet a standardized treatment of these patients.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399021","annotations":[{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.904407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.71056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.500111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Sideroblastic anemia","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideroblastic_anemia"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.33523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Bucharest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest"},{"name":"Janus kinase 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_2"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
