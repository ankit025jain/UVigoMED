{"id":87026,"title":"KSHV attachment and entry are dependent on ?V?3 integrin localized to specific cell surface microdomains and do not correlate with the presence of heparan sulfate.","abstract":"Cellular receptors for KSHV attachment and entry were characterized using tyramide signal amplification (TSA)-enhanced confocal microscopy. Integrins ?V?3, ?V?5 and ?3?1 were detected on essentially all the actin-based cell surface microdomains that initially bind KSHV, while the presence of CD98 and heparan sulfate (HS), the putative attachment receptor, was more variable. KSHV bound to the same cell surface microdomains with and without HS indicating that initial attachment of KSHV is not dependent on HS and that receptors other than HS can mediate attachment. A human salivary gland (HSG) epithelial line was identified, which lacks ?V?3 but expresses high levels of HS, ?3?1 and other putative KSHV receptors. These cells were resistant to KSHV binding and infection. Reconstitution of cell surface ?V?3 rendered HSG cells highly susceptible to KSHV infection, demonstrating a critical role for ?V?3 in the binding and entry of KSHV that is not shared with other proposed receptors.
