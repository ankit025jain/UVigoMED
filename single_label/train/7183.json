{"id":7183,"title":"Acute white matter injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage: potential role of lipocalin 2.","abstract":"White matter injury occurs after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and has not been well studied. In this study, we investigated acute white matter injury in a mouse SAH model and the role of lipocalin 2 (LCN2) in that injury.SAH was induced by endovascular perforation in wild-type (WT) or LCN2 knockout (LCN2-/-) mice. Sham WT mice underwent the same procedure without perforation. MRI was performed 24 hours after SAH and the volumes of the T2-hyperintensity in white matter were measured. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine white matter injury.Mortality rates and SAH severity were not significantly different between WT and LCN2-/- animals. T2-hyperintensity in the white matter was observed in all WT animals at 24 hours after SAH (6.1±2.7 versus 0.06±0.07 mm3 in sham; P<0.001), and the volume of T2-hyperintensity tended to correlate with SAH severity (r=0.30; P=0.055). In WT animals with SAH, numerous LCN2-positive cells were observed in white matter. In contrast, LCN2-/- animals scarcely developed white matter T2-hyperintensity after SAH (0.5±0.5 mm3; P<0.001, versus WT). Markers of axonal damage and myelin degradation were increased in white matter after SAH in WT compared with those in LCN2-/- animals (P<0.05).SAH results in an acute white matter injury at 24 hours in mice, and LCN2 plays an important role in SAH-induced white matter injury.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893611","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.924245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.797443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.728081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.611959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.50668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.241274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Lipocalin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipocalin"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Hyperintensity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperintensity"},{"name":"Le Canal Nouvelles","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Canal_Nouvelles"}]}
