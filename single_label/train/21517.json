{"id":21517,"title":"The inflammasomes in autoinflammatory diseases with skin involvement.","abstract":"During the past years, significant progress in the understanding of the complexity, regulation, and relevance of innate immune responses underlying several inflammatory conditions with neutrophilic skin involvement has been made. These diseases belong to the novel class of autoinflammatory diseases, and several are caused by mutations in genes regulating the function of innate immune complexes, termed inflammasomes, leading to enhanced secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1?. Consequently, targeting of IL-1? has proven successful in the treatment of these diseases, and the identification of related pathogenic mechanisms in other more common skin diseases characterized by autoinflammation and neutrophilic tissue damage also provides extended opportunities for therapy by interfering with IL-1 signaling.
