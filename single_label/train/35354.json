{"id":35354,"title":"Familial amyloidosis cutis dyschromica: a case report.","abstract":"Amyloidosis cutis dyschromica (ACD) is a rare form of macular amyloidosis characterized by hypo and hyperpigmented macules. Here we described a 20 year old girl with diffuse hypo and hyperpigmentation since she was four years old. Five other members of her family are also involved. Biopsy of hyperpigmented lesions revealed increase of melanin in the basal layer, pigment incontinence and amorphous eosinophilic masses stained positive with Congo red in the papillary dermis. The histopathologic findings were consistent with amyloidosis cutis dyschromica. Other investigations were normal. Dermatologists should consider amyloidosis cutis dyschromica when visit a patient with diffuse hypo and hyperpigmentation.
