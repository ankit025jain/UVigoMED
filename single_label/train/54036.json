{"id":54036,"title":"S100 family signaling network and related proteins in pancreatic cancer (Review).","abstract":"The occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer is a complex process convoluted by multi-pathogenies, multi-stages and multi-factors. S100 proteins are members of the S100 family that regulate multiple cellular pathways related to pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis. S100 proteins have a broad range of intracellular and extracellular functions, including the regulation of protein phosphorylation and enzyme activity, calcium homeostasis and the regulation of cytoskeletal components and transcriptional factors. S100 proteins interact with receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), p53 and p21, which play a role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and metastasis, and also interact with cytoskeletal proteins and the plasma membrane in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis. S100A11 and S100P are significant tumor markers for pancreatic cancer and unfavorable predictors for the prognosis of patients who have undergone surgical resection. Recently, S100A2 has been suggested to be a negative prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer, and the expression of S100A6 may be an independent prognostic impact factor. The expression of S100A4 and S100P is associated with drug resistance, differentiation, metastasis and clinical outcome. This review summarizes the role and significance of the S100 family signaling network and related proteins in pancreatic cancer.
