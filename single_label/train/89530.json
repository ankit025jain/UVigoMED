{"id":89530,"title":"Effects of weekend admission on the outcomes and management of ruptured aortic aneurysms.","abstract":"Ruptured aortic aneurysm is a condition with a high rate of mortality that requires prompt surgical intervention. It has been noted that in some conditions requiring such prompt intervention, in-hospital mortality is increased in patients admitted on the weekends compared with patients admitted on weekdays. We sought to determine if this was indeed the case for both ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and to elucidate the possible reasons.Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a publicly available database of inpatient care, we analyzed the incidence of mortality among 7200 patients admitted on the weekends compared with weekdays for ruptured aortic aneurysm. Among these patients, 19% had a TAA and 81% had an AAA, and each group was analyzed for differences in mortality during the hospitalization. We adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, hospital characteristics, rates of surgical intervention, timing of surgical intervention, and use of additional therapeutic measures.Patients admitted on the weekend for both ruptured TAA and AAA had a statistically significant increase in mortality compared with those admitted on the weekdays (TAA: odds ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.68; P = .03; AAA: odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.55; P = .0004). Among those with TAA, a surgical intervention was performed on day of admission in 62.1% of weekday admissions vs 34.9% of weekend admissions (P < .0001). This difference was much smaller among those with an aortic aneurysm; 79.6% had a surgical intervention on day of admission on a weekday vs 77.2% on the weekend (P < .0001).Weekend admission for ruptured aortic aneurysm is associated with an increased mortality compared with admission on a weekday, and this is likely due to several factors including a delay in prompt surgical intervention.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709439","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.746633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.729208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.603267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.488165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.434851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.424516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.399023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.258139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Week","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week"},{"name":"6th millennium BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_millennium_BC"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Trans Australia Airlines","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Australia_Airlines"},{"name":"Inpatient care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient_care"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
