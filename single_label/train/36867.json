{"id":36867,"title":"Second-trimester induced abortions in two tertiary centres in Rome.","abstract":"Demand for second-trimester induced abortions (STIAs) increases in Italy. For these procedures, prostaglandins alone were used until 2010, when mifepristone became available. The present study compares the two modalities, and investigates the reasons for STIAs.The records of all such procedures performed at the Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Urology of the 'Sapienza' University (Rome), between January 2004 and December 2012, and of all those done at the 'San Filippo' Hospital (Rome), between January 2010 and December 2012, were analysed. Data gathered included women's age, obstetric history, reasons for requesting the STIA, gestational age, mode of intervention, and complications if any.During the study period, 353 women requested a STIA. Karyotype or genetic anomalies were the reason for the request in 187 cases (53%), while structural anomalies, both single and multiple, were given as the reason in 158 (45%). In most cases, these anomalies were assessed by ultrasound scan.Few studies have investigated reasons for requesting STIAs. Of all chromosome abnormalities diagnosed in this study, trisomy 21 was the most common (59%) and it was the most frequent reason for requesting pregnancy termination.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533469","annotations":[{"name":"Mifepristone","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.819139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.795292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.775785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.684253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.583455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.370168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.279473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.241444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.113347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Trisomy 21","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_21"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sapienza University of Rome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapienza_University_of_Rome"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
