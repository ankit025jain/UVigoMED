{"id":62465,"title":"Cavernous hemangioma arising from the diaphragm.","abstract":"A 51-year-old man was referred to our hospital with an abnormal nodule in the right lung field. Computed tomography revealed a homogeneous nodule adjacent to the diaphragm, which appeared to be an extrapulmonary lesion. No hilar or mediastinal lymph node swelling was detected, and positron-emission tomography showed no significant uptake. At surgery, 2 red papillary tumors were found, originating from the right diaphragm, and tumor extirpation was performed. The pathological diagnosis was cavernous hemangioma.
