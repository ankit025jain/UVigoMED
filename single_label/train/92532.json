{"id":92532,"title":"Expression of TIM-3 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis.","abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process that targets the synovial lining of diarthrodial joints. TIM-3 plays a key role in the negative regulation of the immune response. In this study, we investigated the expression of TIM-3 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from systemic (peripheral blood) and local (synovial fluid) perspectives of RA. Level of TIM-3+ cells from peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients as well as peripheral blood of healthy controls was measured by flow cytometry. Results showed that TIM-3 expression was significantly increased in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of RA (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, patients revealed even higher expression of TIM-3 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in synovial fluid than in peripheral blood. When comparing TIM-3 level with the severity of RA, we identified that the percentage of TIM-3 on both peripheral CD4+ and peripheral CD8+ T cells was negatively correlated with disease activity score 28 (DAS28) of the patients. Similarly, TIM-3 on synovial fluid CD4+ and CD8+ T cells also revealed inverse correlation with DAS28 of the cases. Our data demonstrate a negative correlation between TIM-3 and the disease progression of RA.
