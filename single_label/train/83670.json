{"id":83670,"title":"[The determination of the natural content of chemical elements in human biological objects (liver, kidney, stomach) by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to continue the studies of the sites of concentration of the chemical elements corresponding to normal homeostasis in human biological objects by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. The study yielded the data on the natural content of 27 elements in the cadaveric liver, kidney, and stomach. It is recommended to use these findings as the reference parameters corresponding to normal homeostasis.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275185","annotations":[{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.826984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.795373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.653495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.554905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.434593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Inductively coupled plasma","weight":0.305882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.257007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.249998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Inductive coupling","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.098008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Electromagnetic induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction"},{"name":"Evaluation strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"The Elements (song)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_(song)"}]}
