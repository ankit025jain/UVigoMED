{"id":15944,"title":"Trends in discovery of new drugs for tuberculosis therapy.","abstract":"After the introduction of isoniazid and rifampicin, the second one discovered in the Lepetit Research Laboratories (Milan, Italy), under the supervision of Professor Piero Sensi, tuberculosis (TB) was considered an illness of the past. Unfortunately, this infectious disease is still a global health fear, due to the multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and extensively circulating drug-resistant strains, as well as the unrecognized TB transmission, especially in regions with high HIV incidence. In the last few years, new antitubercular molecules appeared on the horizon both in preclinical and clinical stage of evaluation. In this review, we focus on a few of them and on their mechanism of action. Two new promising drug targets, DprE1 and MmpL3, are also discussed.
