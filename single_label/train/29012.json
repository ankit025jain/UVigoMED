{"id":29012,"title":"Reporting adverse events at geriatric facilities: categorization by type of adverse event and function of reporting personnel.","abstract":"Adverse events and patient care-related adverse events are a challenging universal problem, among elder residents of geriatric facilities. The aim of this study was to examine which types of adverse events are characteristic of the geriatric center studied and which of the nursing staff reported this event.Data were retrieved from the computerized adverse event management system at a large geriatric center in central Israel, and all adverse events reported over the past three years were examined.The study findings indicate that the most common type of adverse event was falls. Older nurses with greater seniority in the facility show a higher tendency to report adverse events. In addition, registered nurses were found to report more often than practical nurses.This study highlights the important role that nurses can play in reporting and reducing adverse events. The role of the nurse is becoming increasingly complex, especially in geriatric facilities, which serve people with complex mental and physical states who are more susceptible to adverse events to begin with.Despite the large number of adverse events, few studies have been undertaken on adverse events in geriatrics in general, and in nursing homes and long-term facilities in particular. Answers to these questions will enable improvement in the quality of care provided and ensure a safe care environment for residents. Systematically examining types of adverse events and the characteristics of those who do and do not report them, can contribute to improvement of processes in the healthcare system in general, and in the facility in particular. Additionally, efficient investigation can improve the behavior of those who enable adverse events.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745135","annotations":[{"name":"Israel","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.760991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Registered nurse","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.350053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.206759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Body","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Universal algebra","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Healthcare in Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Switzerland"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Management system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_system"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Seniority","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seniority"},{"name":"Central District (Israel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_District_(Israel)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Report","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Event management","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_management"}]}
