{"id":29383,"title":"Prognostic factors of Atractylis gummifera L. poisoning, Morocco.","abstract":"In Morocco, acute Atractylis gummifera L. poisoning represents the leading cause of death by plant poisoning especially for children. All cases received in the Moroccan poison control centre from January 1981 to December 2009 (n = 467) were included in a retrospective study of the characteristics and risk factors of A. gummifera L. poisoning. The most vulnerable age group was children (63.4% of cases). Most cases were due to accidental exposure (75.5%), but some were from therapeutic use (18.1%) or attempted abortion (7.4%). Patients presented with moderate poison severity signs (grade 2) in 22.3% of cases or severe signs (grade 3) in 21.0%. The mortality rate was 39.2%. The majority of deaths (81.1%) occurred in children aged < 15 years following accidental exposure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for mortality were coma (OR = 20.5); hepatitis (OR = 52.7) and rural residence (OR = 7.26), while gastric decontamination was a protector factor (OR = 0.26).","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673087","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.640126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.454125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.316728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.27286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morocco","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Psychedelic therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Poison control center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_control_center"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Human decontamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_decontamination"}]}
