{"id":4409,"title":"GCRBS score: a new scoring system for predicting outcome in severe falciparum malaria.","abstract":"Severe falciparum malaria is a critical illness resulting in multi-organ dysfunction and death. Severe malaria is defined by the World Health Organisation as a qualitative variable. The purpose of this study is to devise a scoring system for predicting outcome in severe falciparum malaria.112 cases of severe falciparum malaria diagnosed as per the WHO criteria, were evaluated to determine the parameters which were significantly associated with mortality. Of all the parameters studied, five variables namely cerebral malaria (GCS < 11), Renal failure (Creatinine > 3 mg/dl), Respiratory distress (Respiratory rate > 24/min), Jaundice (Bilirubin >10 mg/dl) and Shock (Systolic BP < 90 mm of Hg) were all found to be associated with a poor prognosis.The five selected parameters were analysed using the Odds ratio and a new scoring system named as GCRBS score was designed with a possible score from 0-10. With a cut-off score of 5, the GCRBS score predicted mortality with a sensitivity of 85.3% and a specificity of 95.6%.The GCRBS score is easy to calculate and apply. Of the 5 parameters, 3 are clinical which can be determined at bedside and only 2 are biochemical which can be done in any laboratory.The most important advantage of this scoring system is that all the 5 parameters are to be assessed quantitatively for allotting a score, which would eliminate the possibility of observer bias.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25327086","annotations":[{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.769436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Respiratory rate","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.690201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.54469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.482312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.328812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.237526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.136208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
