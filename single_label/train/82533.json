{"id":82533,"title":"Retrospective evaluation of CAD/CAM cantilever reconstructions to restore compromised posterior teeth: a preliminary report.","abstract":"To describe the survival, clinical rating, and patient satisfaction of monolithic computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) ceramic single unit cantilever crowns placed on hemisected molars and premolars after a follow-up of at least 12 months.Sixteen consecutive patients (mean age, 56.8 years) with 16 restored two-unit cantilever crowns (5 premolars and 11 hemisected molar abutments) were reevaluated after an observation period of at least 12 months. Tooth mobility, plaque and bleeding scores, and pocket probing depths were assessed on both the restored and contralateral untreated teeth. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a visual analog scale.The mean observation time was 25.7 Â± 13.1 months. All restorations were in situ, and no significant biologic differences were observed between the treated and contralateral teeth. Clinical evaluation showed good performance, and patient satisfaction was recorded as excellent.The use of CAD/CAM ceramic single-unit cantilever crowns may be regarded as a conservative and cost-effective treatment modality with high patient acceptance in carefully selected patients.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596916","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.474686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.467274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ceramic","weight":0.262872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.233774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Computer-aided technologies","weight":0.228676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_technologies"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Cantilever","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
