{"id":23234,"title":"Safety with ocrelizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: results from the ocrelizumab phase III program.","abstract":"The objective was to determine the safety of ocrelizumab (OCR) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).This was an analysis of the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods and long-term follow-up of 4 OCR phase III trials in RA (SCRIPT, STAGE, FILM and FEATURE). Safety data per study and the results of a meta-analysis of serious infectious events (SIEs) are presented.Overall, 868 patients received placebo, 1064 patients OCR 200 mg×2 (or 400 mg×1) (OCR200), and 827 patients OCR 500 mg×2 (OCR500) plus background methotrexate (MTX) at baseline and 24 weeks. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods, the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the OCR+MTX and placebo +MTX groups. Infusion-related reactions were more common with OCR+MTX and decreased in frequency with subsequent infusions. Serious infusion-related reactions were rare (0.1%). Serious infections occurred more frequently with OCR500+MTX. In the meta-analysis, a statistically significant difference from placebo +MTX in incidence of SIEs per 100 patient-years of 2.4 (95% CI, 0.3-4.5) was observed with OCR500+MTX, but not with OCR200+MTX (0.6; 95% CI, -1.3 to 2.4). Patients recruited in Asia exhibited a higher risk of serious infections (hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.03-3.06). The incidence of human anti-human antibodies was <5%. Long-term follow-up indicated no differences in malignancy rates between the treatment groups. There was no apparent difference in time to B-cell repletion between the OCR dose groups.In placebo-controlled clinical trials of RA, OCR500+MTX was associated with a higher risk of serious infections compared with placebo +MTX. The safety profile of OCR 200+MTX was comparable with placebo+MTX.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498318","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.871956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.81461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.705208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.34099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.299239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.269364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.26648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Ocrelizumab","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocrelizumab"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Optical character recognition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"}]}
