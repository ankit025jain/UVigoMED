{"id":53169,"title":"Comprehensive evaluation of androgen replacement therapy in aging Japanese men with late-onset hypogonadism.","abstract":"This study assessed the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in aging Japanese men with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH).This study included 50 (median age: 57.7 years) Japanese men with LOH, who were consecutively enrolled and treated with TRT for at least six months at our institution. We evaluated the following measurements before and after six months of treatment with TRT as follows: blood tests, prostate volume, residual urine volume, self-ratings for International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Aging Male Symptom (AMS) and the Medical Outcomes Study 8-item Short-Form health survey (SF-8).Following six months of TRT, the levels of testosterone, red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly increased from baseline, while total cholesterol level was significantly decreased from baseline. Furthermore, TRT led to a significant increase in IIEF-5 score and a significant decrease in IPSS score. Of 30 men who were diagnosed with depression at baseline, only 11 men (36.7%) were still suffering from depression after TRT, and SDS scores were significantly decreased from baseline at month six. Treatment with TRT led to a significant decrease in all scores of the AMS scale as well as a significant improvement in all scores of the SF-8 survey, with the exception of the bodily pain score.These findings suggest that TRT is an effective and safe treatment for aging Japanese men with LOH. TRT improved depressive symptoms as well as health-related quality of life.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533913","annotations":[{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.736201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.719178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Androgen replacement therapy","weight":0.579637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.462713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.373873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
