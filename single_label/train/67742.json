{"id":67742,"title":"Enhanced response using a multicomponent urine alarm treatment for nocturnal enuresis.","abstract":"The current study investigated the effects of using the combination of a urine alarm and simple reward system to treat nocturnal enuresis (NE) for three children who failed to fully respond to the urine alarm alone.A withdrawal design (i.e., ABACA) embedded within a delayed multiple baseline design across participants was used to evaluate the effects of the urine alarm alone and in combination with a reward system on participants' frequency of wet nights per week. Results were analyzed through visual and descriptive methods.The urine alarm in combination with a reward system resulted in improvements in all three participants' NE. These results are contrasted with the urine alarm alone, which produced less frequent dry nights.Nursing professionals in primary care settings are positioned to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations to families with children with NE. Findings from the current study provide a promising approach to the treatment of NE for those children who fail to respond fully to the urine alarm.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589159","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.552618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.229985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Nocturnal enuresis","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.132977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Enuresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuresis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Alarm clock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_clock"},{"name":"Multi-component reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-component_reaction"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
