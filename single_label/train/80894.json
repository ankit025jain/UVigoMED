{"id":80894,"title":"In vivo confocal microscopy features of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","abstract":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis is widely distributed, Spain being a hypoendemic region. Noninvasive bedside detection of the histopathologic response to the intracellular organism that allows rapid diagnosis and prompt therapy could be the ideal tool to manage a commonly self-healing lesion. Confocal microscopy is a technique which allows in vivo examination of the skin at cellular resolution.We describe the in vivo confocal microscopic features of cutaneous leishmaniasis, finding a correlation with dermoscopy and histopathology.This case illustrates the capability of confocal microscopy to characterize the cutaneous infection by Leishmania organisms and to perform a noninvasive diagnosis.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503465","annotations":[{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.76687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.664119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Dermatoscopy","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatoscopy"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.14551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"}]}
