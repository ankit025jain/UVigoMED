{"id":66029,"title":"Translating extranuclear steroid receptor signaling to clinical medicine.","abstract":"The existence and function of extranuclear steroid receptors (SR) to rapidly modulate signal transduction is now acknowledged as present in cells and organs throughout the body. Work over the past 15 years has defined key mechanisms that are required for sex steroid receptors to traffic to the plasma membrane, but mechanisms of localization in other cell organelles such as mitochondria is still unclear. Signaling by membrane-localized SR has now been reported to impact many aspects of adult organ functions, while the roles in organ development are under investigation. In hormone-responsive cancers, both extranuclear and nuclear sex steroid receptors appear to collaborate in the regulation of some key genes that promote malignancy. Here, I review what is understood about the impact of extranuclear steroid receptor signaling to mitigate or promote disease processes.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752388","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.826331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.809561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.732756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Steroid hormone receptor","weight":0.628281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.496535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.47929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.346886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.305893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.263204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.181252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.105451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Organogenesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organogenesis"},{"name":"Signal (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(physiology)"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
