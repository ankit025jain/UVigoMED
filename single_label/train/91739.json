{"id":91739,"title":"Extremity injuries as predictors of emergency care resource needs among blunt trauma patients in Japan.","abstract":"This study aimed to exhaustively examine associations between prehospital variables and emergency care resource needs among blunt trauma patients. The study included blunt trauma patients aged 15 years or older who were admitted to a tertiary care medical center in Osaka, Japan, from January 2005 to December 2009. The primary end point was a composite measure of overall emergency care resource needs. Predictive variables were easily detectable upper and lower extremity injuries. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify associations between the predictive variables and the end point; this model included other covariates known to be associated with emergency care resource needs (demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, and physiological parameters). Of 982 blunt trauma patients, 81 died, and 573 required overall emergency care resources. Upper extremity injury (odds ratio [OR], 2.60) and lower extremity injury (OR, 4.50) were significantly associated with overall emergency care resource needs after controlling for other covariates. The results of this study suggest that easily detectable extremity injuries may be useful predictors of the emergency care resource needs of trauma patients. Further studies are needed to validate the predictive values of these injuries and to determine ways to use information about extremity injuries to improve triage decisions.
