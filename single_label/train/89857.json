{"id":89857,"title":"Meniscal tears: comparison of the conventional spin-echo and fast spin-echo techniques through image processing.","abstract":"Conventional spin-echo (PD-CSE) and fast spin-echo (PD-FSE) techniques are frequently used to detect meniscal tears. However, the time delay for imaging with PD-CSE has resulted in its replacement with faster techniques, such as proton density fast spin-echo (PD-FSE), which has become a frequent tool at most diagnostic centres.Qualitative analysis shows that the PD-CSE technique is more sensitive, but other authors have not found significant differences between the aforementioned techniques. Therefore, we performed a quantitative analysis in this study that aims to measure differences in the quality of the images obtained with both techniques.We compared the PD-CSE and PD-FSE techniques by quantitatively analysing the obtained proton density images: the area shown, as well as the brightness and lesion contrast of the obtained image.A set of 100 images from 50 patients thought to contain meniscal tears of the knee were selected. These 100 images were obtained from all individuals using both the PD-CSE and PD-FSE techniques. The images were processed using software developed in Delphi. In addition to these quantifications, three physicians, who are specialists in radiology and capable of analysing magnetic resonance (MR) images of the musculoskeletal system, qualitatively analysed the diagnostic sensitivity of both techniques.On average, samples obtained via the PD-CSE technique contained 22% more pixels in the lesion area. The contrast differed by 28%, and the brightness differed by 31%. The two techniques were correlated using Student's t-test, which showed a statistically significant difference. The specialists detected meniscal tears in 30 of the images obtained via the PD-CSE technique, while only 72% of these cases were detected via the PD-FSE technique.The PD-CSE technique was shown to be superior to PD-FSE for all of the evaluated properties, making its selection preferable.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673813","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.679268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.608196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.580002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.526543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.48501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.310822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.238867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Pixel","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Delphi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Brightness","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Sampling (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Broadcast delay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_delay"},{"name":"Meniscal cartilage replacement therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscal_cartilage_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Aspect-oriented software development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_software_development"}]}
