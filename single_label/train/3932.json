{"id":3932,"title":"[Prevention and treatment of aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss by shugan jiangu recipe in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: a clinical study].","abstract":"To study the effect of Shugan Jiangu Recipe (SJR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and serum bone metabolic biochemical markers in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with osteopenia.Totally 38 patients of postmenopausal women with breast cancer, who received aromatase inhibitors (AIs), were assigned to the treatment group (21 cases) and the control group (17 cases) by using random digit table. All patients took Caltrate D Tablet (containing Ca 600 mg and Vit D3 125 IU), one tablet daily. Patients in the treatment group took SJR, 6 g each time, twice daily for 6 successive months. The bone mineral density (BMD) level was detected before treatment and at months 6 after treatment. Levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), bone gla protein (BGP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The drug safety was also assessed.Compared with before treatment, BMD of L2-4 and femur neck obviously increased in the treatment group at month 6 after treatment (P < 0.01), serum BALP and TRAP decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with before treatment, BMD of L2-4 and femur neck obviously decreased in the control group at month 6 after treatment (P < 0.05), serum BALP and TRAP increased (P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, lumbar and femur neck BMD obviously increased, serum levels of BGP and BALP obviously decreased, and serum levels of CTX-II and TRAP obviously increased in the treatment group at month 6 after treatment (P < 0.01). No serious adverse event occurred during the treatment period. Bone fracture occurred in one case of the control group (5.8%).SJR could attenuate bone loss of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received AIs, increase BMD and improve abnormal bone metabolism.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335329","annotations":[{"name":"Bone
