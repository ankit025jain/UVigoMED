{"id":24448,"title":"Determinants and outcomes of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections in Enugu, Nigeria.","abstract":"To evaluate the determinants and outcomes of shunt infection (SI).One hundred ninety-eight pediatric hydrocephalic patients treated with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt between January 2008 and August 2012 were retrospectively studied. Patients with SI were compared to those without SI in terms of the occurrence of risk factors and outcomes. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 15).The age range was 2 weeks to 13 years, with a mean age of 3.1 ± 0.19 years for the SI group versus 2.7 ± 0.2 years for those without SI. One hundred and twelve patients were female and 86 were male. SI was recorded in 17 (8.6%) patients. Postinfective hydrocephalus (n = 6) was the most common cause of hydrocephalus in the SI group. Individuals in the SI group, compared to those without infection, were more likely to be underweight (?2 = 23.4, p < 0.01). The mean interval between VP shunt placement and SI was 1.83 ± 1.25 months. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (29.4%) was the most common pathogen. The mortality rate in our series was 21.4% in patients with SI compared to 2.7% in those without SI.Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is currently the most common cause of SI and underweight children appear have a higher risk.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434896","annotations":[{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.842506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.640578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.578191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.462025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Enugu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enugu"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Vice president","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Software versioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
