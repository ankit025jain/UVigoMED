{"id":43286,"title":"Pneumatosis intestinalis with a focus on hyperbaric oxygen therapy.","abstract":"Pneumatosis intestinalis is a rare condition of air in the bowel wall. Pneumatosis intestinalis is most often secondary to another medical condition. The diagnosis is most often made radiologically with a computed tomography scan. The disease severity ranges from benign to life-threatening. Predictors of poor outcomes include pH less than 7.3, bicarbonate level of less than 20 mEq/L, lactate level of more than 2 mmol/L, amylase level of more than 200 U/L, and portal venous gas on imaging. Early recognition of life-threatening signs and symptoms is critical. Treatment options include bowel rest, antibiotics, surgery, and, more recently, the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is extremely safe, with no reported complications in the literature when used for pneumatosis intestinalis. When surgery is not emergently needed, symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis can be safely treated with hyperbaric oxygen with a high likelihood of success without any considerable adverse effects.
