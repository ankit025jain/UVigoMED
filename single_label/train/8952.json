{"id":8952,"title":"Type I interferon signals in macrophages and dendritic cells control dengue virus infection: implications for a new mouse model to test dengue vaccines.","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infects an estimated 400 million people every year, causing prolonged morbidity and sometimes mortality. Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of appropriate small animal models; mice are naturally not susceptible to DENV and only become infected if highly immunocompromised. Mouse models lacking both type I and type II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG129 mice) or the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR(-/-) mice) are susceptible to infection with mouse-adapted DENV strains but are severely impaired in mounting functional immune responses to the virus and thus are of limited use for study. Here we used conditional deletion of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) on individual immune cell subtypes to generate a minimally manipulated mouse model that is susceptible to DENV while retaining global immune competence. Mice lacking IFNAR expression on CD11c(+) dendritic cells and LysM(+) macrophages succumbed completely to DENV infection, while mice deficient in the receptor on either CD11c(+) or LysM(+) cells were susceptible to infection but often resolved viremia and recovered fully from infection. Conditional IFNAR mice responded with a swift and strong CD8(+) T-cell response to viral infection, compared to a weak response in IFNAR(-/-) mice. Furthermore, mice lacking IFNAR on either CD11c(+) or LysM(+) cells were also sufficiently immunocompetent to raise a protective immune response to a candidate subunit vaccine against DENV-2. These data demonstrate that mice with conditional deficiencies in expression of the IFNAR represent improved models for the study of DENV immunology and screening of vaccine candidates.Dengue virus infects 400 million people every year worldwide, causing 100 million clinically apparent infections, which can be fatal if untreated. Despite many years of research, there are no effective vaccine and no antiviral treatment available for dengue. Development of vaccines has been hampered in particular by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Mouse models used to test dengue vaccine are deficient in interferon (IFN) type I signaling and severely immunocompromised and therefore likely not ideal for the testing of vaccines. In this study, we explored alternative models lacking the IFN receptor only on certain cell types. We show that mice lacking the IFN receptor on either CD11c- or LysM-expressing cells (conditional IFNAR mice) are susceptible to dengue virus infection. Importantly, we demonstrate that conditional IFN receptor knockout mice generate a better immune response to live virus and a candidate dengue vaccine compared to IFNAR mice and are resistant to subsequent challenge.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741106","annotations":[{"name":"Strain
