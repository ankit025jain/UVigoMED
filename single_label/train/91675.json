{"id":91675,"title":"Reconstruction of a complex tracheal injury using an intercostal muscle flap.","abstract":"Blunt tracheobronchial injuries occur rarely but can be life threatening. These injuries require accurate preoperative diagnosis and potentially complex reconstruction. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy who was transferred to the University of Washington with a complex tracheobronchial injury after rolling over in a sand-rail dune buggy. The injury was repaired successfully using an intercostal muscle flap and cardiopulmonary bypass.
