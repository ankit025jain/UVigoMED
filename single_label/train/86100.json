{"id":86100,"title":"Management of pneumothorax differs across Denmark.","abstract":"Pneumothorax is a common problem in Denmark. Guidelines recommend insertion of small-bore (? 14 Fr) chest tubes or simple needle aspiration in spontaneous pneumothorax. Our objective was to investigate the management of pneumothorax in Danish hospitals.We undertook a questionnaire survey at all Danish acute hospitals enquiring about current practice in the management of pneumothorax. A questionnaire was sent to 35 hospitals in May 2013. After follow-up in September 2013, a total of 32 completed questionnaires were assessed.We found that three hospitals (10.7%) used simple needle aspiration in primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The majority of the hospitals treated all types of pneumothorax by inserting chest tubes with a traditional small thoracotomy (75%), and most hospitals used large-bore (> 14 Fr) chest tubes (85.7%). There were no regional differences in the management of pneumothorax among the five regions in Denmark (p > 0.05), but we found a trend towards use of less invasive techniques in hospitals with departments of either Respiratory Medicine or Thoracic Surgery.Management of pneumothorax in Denmark is mainly based on insertion of a large-bore (> 14 Fr) chest tube by a traditional small thoracotomy. Only a few hospitals in Denmark use minimally invasive techniques in the management of spontaneous pneumothorax. We speculate that implementation of these techniques may reduce hospital admission time for patients with spontaneous pneumothorax in Denmark.not relevant.not relevant.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814918","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.925046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.671571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Chest tube","weight":0.655751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_tube"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.377514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Thoracic surgery","weight":0.332243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.214493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.185378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.0267806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0251131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"London Underground","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Speculation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"},{"name":"Japanese dialects","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dialects"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
