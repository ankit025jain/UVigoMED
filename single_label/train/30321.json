{"id":30321,"title":"Craving predicts opioid use in opioid-dependent patients initiating buprenorphine treatment: a longitudinal study.","abstract":"Few studies have assessed associations between craving and subsequent opioid use. We prospectively evaluated the relative utility of two craving questionnaires to predict opioid use among opioid-dependent patients in outpatient treatment.Opioid-dependent patients (n?=?147) initiating buprenorphine treatment were assessed every two weeks for 3 months. Craving was measured using the: (1) Desires for Drug Questionnaire (DDQ) and (2) Penn Alcohol-Craving Scale adapted for opioid craving (PCS). Multi-level logistic regression models estimated the effects of craving on the likelihood of opioid use. Craving assessed at time t was entered as a time-varying predictor of opioid use at time t?+?1.Craving scores plateaued at approximately 2 weeks after initiation of buprenorphine. In adjusted regression models, a 1-point increase in PCS scores (on a 7-point scale) was associated with a significant increase in the odds of opioid use at the subsequent assessment (OR?=?1.27, 95% CI 1.08; 1.49, p?<?0.01). The odds of opioid use at the subsequent follow-up assessment increased significantly as DDQ desire and intention scores increased (OR?=?1.25, 95%CI 1.03; 1.51, p?<?0.05), but was not significantly associated with DDQ negative reinforcement (OR?=?1.01, 95%CI 0.88; 1.17, p?>?0.05) or DDQ control (OR?=?0.97, 95%CI 0.85; 1.11, p?>?0.05) scores.Self-reported craving for opioids was modestly associated with subsequent relapse to opioid use among a cohort of patients treated with buprenorphine. Assessment of craving may provide clinical utility in predicting relapse among treated opioid-dependent patients.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced
