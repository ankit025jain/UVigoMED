{"id":68173,"title":"Effects of intrathecal bupivacaine and bupivacaine plus sufentanil in elderly patients undergoing transurethral resection.","abstract":"The present study compared the effect of bupivacaine and bupivacaine + sufentanil on hemodynamic parameters and characteristics of spinal anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) under spinal anesthesia.The study included 40 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III patients scheduled to undergo TURP. Patients were blindly and randomly divided into two groups. Group B (n = 20) received 10 mg of intrathecal bupivacaine and group BS (n = 20) received 7.5 mg of bupivacaine + 5 ?g of sufentanil. Sensory and motor block characteristics, hemodynamic changes, side effects, and time to first analgesic requirement were recorded. No differences in mean arterial pressure or heart rate, time for sensory blockade to reach the T10 level, and maximum sensory level were observed between the two groups. The time to first analgesic request was longer in group BS (P < 0.05). Motor block was significantly higher in group B (P < 0.05). In terms of side effects, no statistically significant differences occurred between the groups.Similar hemodynamic stability and sufficient level of sensory blockade were provided by bupivacaine and bupivacaine + sufentanil used for spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing TUR. Due to the fact that less motor block was observed and the time to first analgesic request was longer, the combination of bupivacaine + sufentanil might be appropriate for patients undergoing TUR.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553022","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Spinal anaesthesia","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_anaesthesia"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.835959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Intrathecal","weight":0.802772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrathecal"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.753863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.545933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Sufentanil","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufentanil"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.428885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.35861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bupivacaine","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupivacaine"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.233456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
