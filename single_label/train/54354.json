{"id":54354,"title":"Effects of Juglans regia L. leaf extract on hyperglycemia and lipid profiles in type two diabetic patients: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"The Juglans regia L. leaf has been traditionally used for treatment of diabetes mellitus in Iran. But yet, no controlled human study has determined its efficacy in diabetic patients. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the Juglans regia leaf extract on hyperglycemia and lipid profiles in type II diabetic patients.Total 61 patients, suffering from type II diabetes with fasting blood glucose (FBG) between 150 and 200mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 7% and 9% and aged between 40 and 60 years were selected, and randomly divided in to two groups of Juglans regia and placebo. First group received 100mg Juglans regia leaf extract in capsules form two times a day for 3 months and other group received 100mg placebo capsule with the same dosage. The standard anti-diabetic therapy (metformin and glibenclamide, and nutritional regimen) was continued in both groups. At the baseline and after three months the FBG, insulin, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL and liver and renal function tests were determined. In addition general satisfaction with the treatment was identified using health questionnaires.The results indicated that FBG, HbA1c, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in Juglans regia treated patients significantly decreased compared with the baseline and with placebo group. Patients in Juglans regia group were significantly satisfied with Juglans regia treatment compared with the placebo group. No liver, kidney and other side effects were observed in the groups, except more GI events (specially a mild diarrhea) associated with extract treatment at the beginning of the study.In conclusion, treatment of type II diabetic patients with 100mg Juglans regia leaf extract two times a day for three months improves lipid profile and glycemic control without any tangible adverse effects.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System
