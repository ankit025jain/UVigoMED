{"id":19173,"title":"[Features of resistance formation to beta-lactam antibiotics in Francisella tularensis subsp. mediasiatica].","abstract":"Determination of penicillin resistance features in tularemia causative agents of the mediasiatica subspecies, stability evaluation of differences in strains of various taxa and development of a rapid method of F. tularensis intraspecies differentiation.Beta-lactamase activity was determined in 30 strains of Francisella genus bacteria by quantitative iodometric method.All the strains regardless of subspecies membership were characterized by high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, and bacteria of the mediasiatica subspecies in contrast to other francisella did not synthesize beta-lactamase. Our attempts to induce beta-lactamase activity in vitro and in vivo in strains of this subspecies did not succeed. A method of intraspecies differentiation of F. tularensis by nitorcefin disks is proposed based on the distinctive feature.A high level of F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica resistance to beta-lactams in vitro and their inefficiency during therapy of experimental tularemia due to a beta-lactamase negative strain suggests that F. tularensis beta-lactamase is not the leading factor in formation of native penicillin resistance of tularemia causative agent.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738287","annotations":[{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Tularemia","weight":0.424422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tularemia"},{"name":"Subspecies","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.263402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Francisella tularensis","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisella_tularensis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Francisella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisella"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Inefficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inefficiency"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Distinctive feature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinctive_feature"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Native plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant"},{"name":"Iodometry","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodometry"}]}
