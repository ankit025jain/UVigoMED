{"id":69421,"title":"Correlation of metabolic tumor volume and 11C-choline uptake with the pathology of prostate cancer: evaluation by use of simultaneously recorded MR and PET images.","abstract":"This study was conducted to assess the relationship between (11)C-choline uptake and pathologic findings obtained by combined use of magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of patients with prostate cancer.We retrospectively evaluated 69 patients with prostate cancer who underwent (11)C-choline PET-CT and magnetic resonance imaging before radical prostatectomy. Combined MR-PET images were acquired to obtain precise anatomic information. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were compared with pathologic findings from resected specimens as the reference standard.The mean and standard deviation of tumor SUVmax and MTV were 3.9 ± 1.8 and 12.9 ± 16.4, respectively. Tumors with high MTV (?8.2) were more likely to be admixed with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (p < 0.0001) or hyperplasia (p < 0.0001) in the background than those without these findings. Multiple regression analysis also revealed that the presence of hyperplasia (OR; 4.25, 95% CI 1.25-14.4, p = 0.02) and PIN (OR; 9.22, 95% CI 2.60-32.7, p = 0.001) were associated with tumors with high MTV.We have demonstrated, by pathologic evaluation of patients with prostate cancer, that (11)C-choline uptake volume is greater for prostate cancer admixed with PIN and hyperplasia than that without.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446034","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.82267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.785405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.763039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia","weight":0.735959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatic_intraepithelial_neoplasia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.710201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.644757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.513614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.436834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.40408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.320694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.289532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"MTV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"}]}
