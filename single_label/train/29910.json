{"id":29910,"title":"Moving toward trauma-informed practice in addiction treatment: a collaborative model of agency assessment.","abstract":"Clients in substance abuse treatment need, in addition to evidence-based and sensitive treatment services in general, a system of care that takes into account the impact of trauma and violence in so many of their lives. In addition, services need to be delivered in a way that avoids triggering trauma memories or causing unintentional re-traumatization. To that end, this article describes an agency self-assessment process that combines a trauma-informed assessment, a NIATx process of \"walking-through\" and use of the Institute of Healthcare Improvement's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, and a user-friendly format. The trauma-informed assessment is designed to address issues of safety of clients and staff members, reduction of re-traumatization, consistency in practice, and client empowerment. It brings a non-judgmental, collaborative approach to process and practice improvement. The article describes how the assessment process can be--and has been--used to develop an Action Plan, including trainings and the identification of \"trauma champions\"; i.e., staff who will continue to spread trauma-informed changes and new evidence-based practices throughout the agency. As we enter a period of healthcare reform, addressing trauma as an integral part of addiction treatment also allows us to better deal with the totality of our clients' health problems.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592664","annotations":[{"name":"Violence","weight":0.84284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.678467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.593955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Empowerment","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"People's Dispensary for Sick Animals","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Dispensary_for_Sick_Animals"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Radio format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_format"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"},{"name":"Clients (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clients_(album)"}]}
