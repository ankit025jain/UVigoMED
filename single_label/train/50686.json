{"id":50686,"title":"Vascular calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes: the involvement of matrix Gla protein.","abstract":"Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is an important inhibitor of calcification. The objective of the present study of patients with type 2 diabetes and normal or slightly altered kidney function was to evaluate levels of inactive, dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP(dp-ucMGP) and total uncarboxylated MGP(t-ucMGP) and assess their links with biological and clinical parameters (including peripheral vascular calcification).The DIACART study is a cross-sectional cohort study of 198 patients with type 2 diabetes and normal or slightly altered kidney function. Matrix Gla protein levels were measured with an ELISA and all patients underwent multislice spiral computed tomography scans to score below-knee arterial calcification.In the study population as a whole, the mean dp-ucMGP and t-ucMGP levels were 627?±?451 pM and 4868?±?1613 nM, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate, age and current vitamin K antagonist use were independently associated with dp-ucMGP levels. When the study population was divided according to the median peripheral arterial calcification score, patients with the higher score displayed significantly lower t-ucMGP and significantly higher dp-ucMGP levels. Furthermore, plasma dp-ucMGP was positively associated with the peripheral arterial calcification score (independently of age, gender, previous cardiovascular disease and t-ucMGP levels).High dp-ucMGP levels were independently associated with below-knee arterial calcification score in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal or slightly altered kidney function. The reversibility of the elevation of dp-ucMGP levels and the latter's relationship with clinical events merit further investigation.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762216","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.723185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.555524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.513833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.453221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.383694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.320616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.16586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.138135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
