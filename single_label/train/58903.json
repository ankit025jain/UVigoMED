{"id":58903,"title":"Gene-environment interaction in postpartum depression: a Chinese clinical study.","abstract":"Mounting evidence has showed that both nature and nurture exert significant influences on the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases or psychopathologies. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mental disorder that is by far under diagnosed and under treated, which can have a negative impact on both the maternal and the neonatal health. Several risk factors for PPD have been defined, including genetic, environmental, and hormonal. Genetically, postpartum women can be explained by the absence or presence of certain genetic variants that confer increased risk. Environmentally, postpartum women might have been exposed to various psychosocial risk factors. The aim of this study is to examine whether genetic variations of the Serotonin Transporter Promoter Variant (5-HTTLPR), together with environmental stressors, assessed by multiple psychological scales, contribute to the development of PPD symptoms. Results show that 5-HTTLPR is strongly associated with the major depressive disorder in postpartum women. Han Chinese Women who carry the long (L) allele (LL) when experiencing maternal pregnancy complications, prenatal maternal infection, prenatal maternal folate deficiency, or stressful life events during pregnancy, or had senior maternal age upon pregnancy (over 32.8 years old) showed higher prevalence ratios (PR) for symptoms of postpartum depression.
