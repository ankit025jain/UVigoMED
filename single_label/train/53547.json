{"id":53547,"title":"Safety of sitagliptin in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes: a pooled analysis of 25 clinical studies.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sitagliptin 100 mg/day in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.A post hoc pooled analysis of 25 randomized, double-blind, parallel group clinical studies with results available as of 1 December 2011.Multicenter, international clinical trials.Patients with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years or older.Patients were randomized to sitagliptin 100 mg/day (n = 1,261) or a comparator (n = 1,185) for 12 weeks to 2 years.In each study, investigators reported serious and non-serious adverse events that occurred during the study, and serious adverse events occurring within 14 days following the last dose of study drug. This analysis used patient-level data from each study to assess the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of specific adverse events that occurred following initiation of study drug.Summary measures of adverse events overall were similar between the sitagliptin and non-exposed (active comparator or placebo) groups, except for higher incidences of deaths and drug-related adverse events in the non-exposed group. Incidence rates of specific adverse events were generally similar between the two groups, with the exception of hypoglycemia. A lower incidence rate of hypoglycemia was observed in the sitagliptin group compared with the non-exposed group [7.0 vs. 14.3 per 100 patient-years; difference -7.6 (95 % CI -11.2 to -4.3]), primarily due to greater use of sulfonylureas in the non-exposed group.In this pooled safety analysis of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg/day was generally well tolerated for up to 2 years.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510656","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sulfonylurea","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"261","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/261"},{"name":"Post-hoc analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hoc_analysis"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Comparator","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparator"},{"name":"Group 7 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_7_element"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
