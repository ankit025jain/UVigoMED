{"id":41239,"title":"Serotonergic reinforcement of intestinal barrier function is impaired in irritable bowel syndrome.","abstract":"Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).To assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential differences between healthy controls and IBS patients.Fifteen IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples.5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in both healthy controls (7.1 ± 1.7 vs. 2.5 ± 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 ± 4.8 vs. 8.1 ± 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression.Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24943480","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.730883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.716491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.666946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"5-Hydroxytryptophan","weight":0.469444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.412224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tight junction","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Occludin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occludin"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tight junction protein 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction_protein_1"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Barrier function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_function"},{"name":"HTP (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTP_(album)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Kamen Rider ZO","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_ZO"},{"name":"Leaky gut","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut"}]}
