{"id":80253,"title":"Immune response induced by candidate Sarcoptes scabiei var. cuniculi DNA vaccine encoding paramyosin in mice.","abstract":"Sarcoptes scabiei is the causal agent of the highly contagious disease sarcoptic mange (scabies) that affects animals and humans worldwide. An increasing number of cases of treatment failure is being reported because of drug resistance. The development of a specific vaccine would be a sustainable option for control of this disease. In this study, we cloned and expressed a S. scabiei gene encoding paramyosin (PAR) and investigated the immune response elicited by DNA encoding PAR in mice. The ability of the DNA vaccine to express antigen in COS-7 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and IFA. The immune response induced by DNA vaccine was investigated by ELISA, splenocyte proliferation assay, and cytokine production assay. Compared to the pVAX1 control group, the PAR DNA vaccination group showed the higher levels of IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgE, IgM, stronger lymphocyte proliferation in mouse spleen, and larger production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-? in the supernatant of cultures from splenocytes. These results indicated that the PAR DNA vaccine induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response in mice. In conclusion, our results revealed that the S. scabiei PAR DNA vaccine induced both a humoral and cellular immune response, which would provide basic data for the further study to develop an effective vaccine against sarcoptic mange.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Parasitic
