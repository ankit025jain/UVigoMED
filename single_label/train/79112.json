{"id":79112,"title":"[Therapeutic effect and mechanism of Phoenix roebelenii pollen vaccine for treatment of mice with allergic rhinitis].","abstract":"To apply Phoenix roebelenii pollen vaccine to murine models of allergic rhinitis and observe the pathological changes of allergic rhinitis in mice, and to study the efficacy and mechanism of the vaccine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.BALB/c mice models of allergic rhinitis were established by intraperitoneal injection, and then treated with immunotherapy of allergen vaccine by subcutaneous injection. The mice were examined for the levels of airway hyperresponsiveness by a noninvasive lung function detector, for the specific antibodies IgE and IgG2a in serum and cytokines by indirect ELISA, and for the pathological changes of ultrastructure of nasal mucosa of the mice by transmission electron microscopy before and after the treatment.After the immunotherapy, nasal symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness of the mice were relieved. The level of specificity antibody IgG2a in serum was elevated, and IgE dropped significantly. In the culture supernatant of spleen cells, INF-? and IL-10 levels increased and the production of IL-4 decreased.The recombinant profilin of the Phoenix roebelenii pollen as vaccine has a certain therapeutic effect for the pollen allergic rhinitis, and it works maybe through promoting the transition of Th2 to Th1 and regulating the balance of helper T cells.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491046","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin
