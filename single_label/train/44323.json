{"id":44323,"title":"Correlation between depression, anxiety, and polymorphonuclear cells' resilience in ulcerative colitis: the mediating role of heat shock protein 70.","abstract":"To investigate whether anxiety and depression levels are associated with Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).The design was cross-sectional. Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI). Three psychometric questionnaires were used: Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS), Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Colon biopsies were obtained from each affected anatomical site. Severity of inflammation was assessed by eosin/hematoxylin. Constitutive (HSP70c) and inducible (HSP70i) HSP70 expression were immunohistochemically studied.29 UC patients were enrolled (69% men). Mean age was 46.5 years (SD: 19.5). Inflammation severity was moderate in 17 patients, severe in 6, and mild in 6. The mean number of years since diagnosis was 7.9 (SD: 6.5). The mean CAI was 6.4 (SD: 3.1). In active UC, there was downregulation of HSP70c in inflamed epithelium, without significant HSP70 induction. In 22/29 cases of active cryptitis, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) clearly expressed HSP70i, with weak, focal positivity in the other 7 cases. Except for the hospital anxiety scale, scores in all psychometric tools were higher in patients with strong HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN. Logistic regression showed a strong positive relationship between HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN cells and scores in the trait anxiety, ZDRS, and hospital depression scales, (Odds ratios 1.3, 1.3, and 1.5; P = 0.018, 0.023, and 0.038; Wald test, 5.6, 5.2, and 4.3 respectively) and a weaker but significant positive correlation with the CAI (Odds ratio 1.654; P = 0.049; Wald test 3.858).HSP70 is induced in PMN cells of UC patients and its induction correlates with depression and anxiety levels.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742079","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.553763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.522117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.389309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Heat shock protein","weight":0.355063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.345814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.316897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.229008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Mediation (statistics)","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Hsp70","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp70"},{"name":"Wald test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Constitutive equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
