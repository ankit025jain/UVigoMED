{"id":85313,"title":"[Two cases of general anesthesia after recovery from ARDS].","abstract":"There are few reports on general anesthesia in survivors of ARDS. Patients after recovery from ARDS are at risk for compromised pulmonary function, neuromuscular weakness and cognitive dysfunction. We report 2 cases of general anesthesia in survivors of ARDS. In Case 1, a 64-year-old man who had recovered from ARDS associated with Legionella pneumonia underwent carotid endarterectomy. In Case 2, a 69-year-old man who had recovered from ARDS associated with pneumococcal pneumonia underwent hepatectomy. Concerning the preoperative assessments, the spirometry data were almost normal but Hugh-Jones classification scale was II in both cases. Diffusion disturbance might be the cause of discrepancies between good respiratory functions and limited daily activities. In both cases, anesthesia was given with propofol, fentanyl remifentanil and sevoflurane. Peak airway pressure was maintained below 15 cmH2O with pressure control ventilation. They were extubated at the end of surgery and there were no serious complications during the perioperative period.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979863","annotations":[{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.720644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.698754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Legionella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella"},{"name":"Bacterial pneumonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_pneumonia"},{"name":"Remifentanil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remifentanil"},{"name":"Carotid endarterectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_endarterectomy"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Endarterectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endarterectomy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
