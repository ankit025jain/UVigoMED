{"id":14390,"title":"Glycyrrhizin attenuates tissue injury and reduces neutrophil accumulation in experimental acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"Leukocyte infiltration and acinar cell injury are characteristic features of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the signaling pathways regulating inflammation and accumulation of leukocytes into pancreas tissue remains poorly elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the effects of Glycyrrhizin (GZ) on cerulein-induced AP in mice. AP was induced in male C57BL/6 by intraperitoneal injection of 50 ?g/kg cerulein hourly, with a total of 7 times. 1 hour after the last injection of cerulean, mice were treated with either 35 or 70 mg/kg of GZ. Serum amylases and lipases were measured using automated chromogenic assay, MCP-1 and MIP-2 concentrations were measured in the serum by ELISA, and the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in the pancreas were evaluated by flow cytometry. We found that GZ treatment resulted in reduction (i) both amylase and lipase activities, (ii) the serum levels of both MCP-1 and MIP-2; and (iii) markedly attenuated cerulein-induced histopathological alternations and water contents. Furthermore, we observed that GZ significantly decreased the number of infiltrated monocytes and neutrophils into the pancreas tissue. In conclusion, we demonstrate that GZ attenuates AP signs and inhibits inflammatory cell recruitments into pancreas.
