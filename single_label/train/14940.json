{"id":14940,"title":"[Effect of curcumin on calcitionin gene related peptide expression after spinal cord injury in rats].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of curcumin on calcitionin gene related peptide (CGRP) expression after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats.A total of 200 rats, weighing 250-300 g, were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 50): sham-operation group, normal saline (NS) group, low-dose curcumin group (30 mg/kg), and high-dose curcumin group (100 mg/kg). In sham-operation group, only vertebral lamina excision was performed without SCI; the SCI model was established in the other 3 groups. At immediate after modeling, 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg curcumin were injected intraperitoneally in 2 curcumin groups, equivalent NS was given in NS group (30 mg/kg), but no treatment in sham-operation group. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after operation, the motor neural function was evaluated by the inclined plane test and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores; immunohistochemical staining and Western blot assay were used to observe CGRP expression.BBB score and inclined plane test score of NS group, low-dose curcumin group, and high-dose curcumin group were significantly lower than those of sham-operation group at each time point (P < 0.05). BBB score of low-dose curcumin group and high-dose curcumin group was significantly higher than that of NS group at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after SCI (P < 0.05), and the score of high-dose group was significantly higher than that of low-dose curcumin group at 7, 14, and 21 days after SCI (P < 0.05). Inclined plane test score of low-dose curcumin group and high-dose curcumin group was significantly higher than that of NS group at 7, 14, and 21 days after SCI (P < 0.05), and the score of high-dose curcumin group was significantly higher than that of low-dose curcumin group at 7, 14, and 21 days after SCI (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining results showed that the CGRP positive cells of sham-operation group was significantly more than those of the other 3 groups, and the CGRP positive cells of high-dose curcumin group were significantly more than those of low-dose curcumin group at each time point (P < 0.05); the CGRP positive cells of low- and high-dose curcumin groups were significantly more than those of NS group at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after SCI (P < 0.05). Western blot assay results showed that the CGRP protein expressed at each time point after SCI in sham-operation group; the CGRP protein expression gradually decrease with time passing in NS group; but the CGRP protein expression gradually increased with time passing in low- and high-dose curcumin groups, and reached the peak at 14 days, then maintained a high level.After SCI in rats, 30 mg/kg curcumin can improve rats' motor function, and 100 mg/kg curcumin effect is more obvious, especially in promoting the expression of CGRP. That may be the mechanism of protection of the nervous system.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397136","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.890905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.8195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.794437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.312715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.30323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.261135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.200785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.0893031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin_gene-related_peptide"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
