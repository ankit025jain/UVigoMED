{"id":79322,"title":"Ectopic pituitary adenoma associated with an empty sella presenting with hearing loss: case report with literature review.","abstract":"Ectopic pituitary adenomas are uncommon entities that may pose substantial diagnostic challenges. In the majority of these cases, patients present with endocrine and/or nasal obstruction symptoms. We report the case of an ectopic pituitary adenoma in a 76-year-old man with an empty sella who initially presented with right-sided hearing loss progressing to bilateral hearing loss over the next 4 years. Neuroimaging studies revealed a large, expansile central skull base mass replacing the clivus and sphenoid sinus, and invading the internal auditory canals and inner ear bilaterally. The tumor also involved the floor of the middle cranial fossae and bilateral medial temporal and occipital bones. Histopathologic examination, including immunohistochemical studies, revealed a sparsely granulated lactotroph adenoma. Hearing loss in a patient with ectopic pituitary adenoma constitutes an extremely unusual presentation. This case was further complicated by the presence of an empty sella and the absence of symptoms related to hyperprolactinemia.
