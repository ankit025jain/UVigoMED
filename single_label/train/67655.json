{"id":67655,"title":"Correlation of mitotic indices, AgNor count, Ki-67 and Bcl-2 with grade and stage in papillary urothelial bladder cancer.","abstract":"To evaluate the mutual inter-relationship of mitotic indices, argyrophilic nuclear organizer regions (AgNOR) count, Ki-67 and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (bcl-2) in papillary urothelial bladder cancer (pUBC), and their correlation with grade and stage. To establish the cut-off values of these markers to detect high grade and muscle invasive bladder cancer.Fifty-four patients with primary pUBC who underwent transurethral resection / radical cystectomy were analyzed retrospectively. Cell proliferation was assessed by Ki-67 labelling index, mean AgNOR count, mitotic count, mitotic activity index and mitosis/ volume index. Immunohistochemistry was done to see bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression. Correlation of these indices with tumor grade and stage and amongst themselves was assessed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to establish the cut-off values.We found a strong positive correlation of mitotic indices and Ki-67 with tumor grade (P = .000), stage (P < .05) and bcl-2 (P = .000). AgNOR count correlated positively with the grade (P = .006), mitotic indices and Ki-67 (P = .032) but not with tumor stage and bcl-2. Cytoplasmic bcl-2 immunopositivity was seen in 42.3% of low grade pUBC and 85.7% of high grade pUBC cases (P = .001). bcl-2 positivity was seen in 85% of muscle invasive pUBC as compared to only 52.9% of superficial cases. Ki-67 ? 32.5%, ? 14 mitoses/10 high power fields (hpf), ? 11.20 mitoses/mm2, ? 0.75 mitoses/100 tumor cells and AgNOR ? 11.55 are 100% specific for high grade bladder carcinoma. Ki-67 ? 59% and mitoses ? 36.50 per 10 hpf can indicate muscle invasion with 100% specificity.Cut-off values for Ki-67, mitotic indices and AgNOR can confirm high grade bladder carcinoma in equivocal cases. Ki-67 and mitotic count can serve as potential and reliable indicators of muscle invasion.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595931","annotations":[{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer classification","weight":0.837017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_classification"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.829491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.642728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.605129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.602772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.598734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.449045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.351053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
