{"id":87549,"title":"[Short-term impact of changes in drinking-and-driving legislation in Guadalajara and Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico].","abstract":"The municipalities of Guadalajara and Zapopan, Jalisco State, Mexico, have participated in efforts to reduce road traffic injuries. They have participated actively in the Mexican Road Safety Initiative since 2008. As a result, in September 2010 they passed laws to reduce the legal alcohol levels for driving motor vehicles. To assess the short-term impact of these measures on rates and severity of alcohol-related collisions and injuries, we conducted a secondary analysis of official databases on mortality, morbidity, and collisions. We performed a time-series analysis to assess the trend. Significant changes were observed in the monthly proportion of alcohol-related deaths and collision rates following these interventions. The article concludes with recommendations to improve the reform's enforcement and results.
