{"id":4705,"title":"[Incidence of malocclusion in children living in areas with high fluoride content in water].","abstract":"The paper presents the results of orthodontic examination of 503 schoolchildren from the region with high content of fluoride in drinking water. It was found that the prevalence of malocclusions in the examined population subgroup was 71.38 ± 2.02%. The highest rate was revealed in the village of Sosnivka 73.69 ± 3.20% followed by 69.04 ± 3.71% and 70.89 ± 3.61% in the cities of Chervonograd and Dobrotvir. Deep bite was diagnosed in 16.70 ± 1.66% and distal occlusion in 13.32 ± 1.52%. Open bite and mesial occlusion were diagnosed in 7.35 ± 1.17% and 4.38 ± 0.92%. Transversal plane malocclusions were observed in 11.53 ± 1.42%, in 5.37 ± 1.00% cases the cause was narrow dental arch, in 2.48 ± 0.69% - disproportions of the width of the upper and lower dental arches.
