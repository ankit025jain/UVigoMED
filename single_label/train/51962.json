{"id":51962,"title":"Apelin levels in relation with hormonal and metabolic profile in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"To evaluate serum concentrations of apelin in relation to the hormonal and metabolic profile in patients with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 45 women with PCOS and 45 age-matched controls were eligible for the study. Hirsutism scores, hormonal and metabolic profile as well as apelin levels were evaluated in each subject.Women with PCOS exhibited lower serum concentrations of apelin than controls (194.1±50.7pg/ml versus 292.1±85.6pg/ml, p<0.001). Apelin levels were significantly correlated positively with body mass index (BMI), insulin, triglyceride (TG), free testosterone (fT) levels, modified Ferriman Gallwey scores and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index; but negatively correlated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in patients with PCOS (p<0.05). When overweight or obese (BMI?25) and normal weight (BMI<25) women with PCOS were compared to BMI-matched controls, lower apelin levels were found in the PCOS group (226.7±45.4pg/ml versus 378.6±80.9pg/ml and 165.5±36.1 versus 249.0±46.6pg/ml, p<0.001, respectively).The data suggest that serum apelin levels are lower in women with PCOS than in controls. Furthermore, apelin can be used as a specific marker for insulin sensitivity and lipid profile and this adipokine might play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642195","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.778318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.413181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Apelin","weight":0.380845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apelin"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.366177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Homeostatic model assessment","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment"}]}
