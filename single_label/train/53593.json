{"id":53593,"title":"A single-institution experience in image-guided thermal ablation of adrenal gland metastases.","abstract":"To assess safety, technical success, local control, and survival associated with percutaneous image-guided adrenal ablation.Adult patients with adrenal metastases who underwent percutaneous image-guided adrenal ablation during the years 2003-2012 were identified. There were 32 patients with 37 adrenal tumors identified. Technical success, safety, local control, and survival were analyzed according to standard criteria.In 32 patients (25 men and 7 women; mean age, 66 y; age range, 44-88 y) with 37 adrenal tumors, 35 ablation procedures were performed. One patient with an 8.2-cm tumor underwent planned cryoablation debulking fully anticipating untreated margins owing to close proximity of the pancreas (ie, the intent was to diminish tumor burden rather than a curative intervention). Of the 36 patients treated with curative intent, technical success was achieved in 35 (97%) tumors. Follow-up imaging was performed on 34 of 37 tumors (excluding patients with intentional debulking [n = 1], technical failure [n = 1], and absence of follow-up [n = 1]). Local recurrence developed in 3 (8.8%) of 34 tumors. Local tumor control was achieved in 31 lesions at a mean of 22.7 months of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival at 36 months were 88% and 52%, respectively, with a median survival of 34.5 months. A Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 grade 3 or 4 complication was observed in three (8.6%) ablation procedures.Image-guided ablation is safe and effective for local control of metastatic adrenal tumors and provides a minimally invasive alternative to surgical resection in appropriately selected patients.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507995","annotations":[{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.871282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.648241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cryoablation","weight":0.575041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoablation"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.316699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Coordinated Incident Management System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Incident_Management_System"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
