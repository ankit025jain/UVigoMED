{"id":82183,"title":"Effects of a novel fluoride-containing aluminocalciumsilicate-based tooth coating material (Nanoseal) on enamel and dentin.","abstract":"To investigate the effect of a fluoride-containing aluminocalciumsilicate nanoparticle glass dispersed aqueous solution (Nanoseal) on enamel and dentin, under the hypothesis that this material can form insoluble mineral deposits that confer acid resistance to the tooth structure and occlude open dentin tubules.Labial enamel and dentin of human extracted incisors were used. Morphology of the enamel and dentin artificially demineralized with a lactic acid solution that before and/or after coated with the test material were analyzed with a wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy electron probe microanalyzer with an image observation function (SEM-EPMA). Moreover, incorporation of the calcium and silicon by enamel and dentin were also detected with SEM-EPMA.Application of the fluoroaluminocalciumsilicate-based tooth coating material resulted in the deposition of substances (nanoparticles) onto the enamel surface porosities and open dentin tubules on the artificial lesions. Prior coating with the test material reduced the demineralization-induced loss of enamel and dentin. Moreover, Ca and Si incorporation into superficial enamel and dentin was detected.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693628","annotations":[{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.838542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Silicon","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.712152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.586964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.558272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.520441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.48033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Deposition (geology)","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(geology)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0819818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Dispersion (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Space probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"}]}
