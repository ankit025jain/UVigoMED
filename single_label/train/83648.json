{"id":83648,"title":"[Study on effect of Polygonatum sibiricum on Yin deficiency model rats induced by long-term overload swimming].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Polygonatum sibiricum on Yin deficiency model rats induced by long-term overload swimming.Except for the normal group, all of the remaining rats performed the long-term overload swimming for eight weeks, with five days every week and once every day, to establish the Yin deficiency model. The daily swimming time increased from 10 min to 180 min at the end of the 7th week, with the water depth of 60 cm and the water temperature at 30 degrees C. After the success of the modeling, the rats were orally administered with different doses of aqueous extracts from P. sibiricum (2.5, 10 g x kg(-1)) for eight weeks. After the final administration, their blood were collected from orbits to measure immunoglobulin A, G and M (IgA, IgG, IgM), interleukin 2 and 6 (IL-2, IL-6) and cAMP, cGMP contents in plasma General behavioral indicators (weight, facial temperature, pain threshold and holding power) of rats were observed during the drug administration.Compared with the model control group, aqueous extracts from P. sibiricum was given for eight weeks to significantly increase the rat weight and holding power of Yin deficiency model rats, decrease the facial temperature and the sensitivity of pain threshold, and increase IgA, IgG, IgM and IL-6 content and IgG content in serum, but without statistical difference. Aqueous extracts from P. sibiricum (10 g x kg(-1)) could also increase IL-2 content in serum, and decrease cAMP content and cAMP/cGMP ratio.P. sibiricum could improve the general behavioral indicators (weight, holding power, pain threshold and facial temperature), immunologic functions (IgA, IgG, IgM) and cyclic nucleotide (cAMP, cAMP/cGMP), so as to ameliorate such Yin deficiency symptoms as dysphoria in chestpalms-soles, weight loss, soreness and weakness of waist and knees, immunologic dysfunction and cyclic nucleotide system disorders.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Pathological
