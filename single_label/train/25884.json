{"id":25884,"title":"[24-hour perfect BP-lowering therapy using long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers].","abstract":"Consistent BP lowering effect is essential for antihypertensive treatment. The dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are potent antihypertensive drugs, and have been reported to reduce future cardiovascular events. The effects of CCB on ambulatory BP have been reported, and could reduce not only daytime, but also nighttime and morning BP. Furthermore, when classified as circadian BP patterns--dippers, non-dippers, extreme dippers, and risers--, long-acting CCBs act to restore abnormal nocturnal dipping status toward a normal dipping pattern in hypertensive patients. These effects partly explain the favorable effects of CCB in preventing future cardiovascular events. This review summarizes the studies of long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs for the \"24-hour perfect management of BP\".","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167753","annotations":[{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.808981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.744907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.323844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Dihydropyridine","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydropyridine"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Blocking (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)"},{"name":"Strike and dip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_and_dip"},{"name":"Channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_blocker"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Dipper","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipper"}]}
