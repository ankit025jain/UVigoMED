{"id":65584,"title":"An evidence-based approach to emergency department management of acute urinary retention.","abstract":"Approximately 10% of men in their 70s and 33% of men in their 80s report at least 1 episode of acute urinary retention, and this urological emergency presents unique assessment and treatment challenges in the emergency department setting. Patients presenting with acute urinary retention are often in severe pain and require urgent diagnosis and prompt treatment. The differential diagnosis of acute urinary retention is vast, with some causes leading to permanent impairment if not dealt with in a timely manner. Quick recognition of the cause and timely bladder decompression are of utmost importance in preventing morbidity and relieving pain. This review analyzes the etiology, key historical and physical findings, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic studies for acute urinary retention in both men and women. Treatment algorithms for men and women, current controversies regarding urinary catheter usage, and recommendations on criteria for disposition are also presented.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804332","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.800003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.714458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.710553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.690269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Urinary catheterization","weight":0.520145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_catheterization"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Health assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_assessment"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
