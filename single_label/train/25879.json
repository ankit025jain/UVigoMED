{"id":25879,"title":"[Vascular variability syndromes].","abstract":"Analytical global and local methods applied to human blood pressure (BP) records of around-the-clock measurements. The chronobiological interpretation of ambulatory BP monitoring records in the light of time-specified reference values derived from healthy peers matched by sex and age identify vascular variability disorders (VVDs) for an assessment of cardio-, cerebro-, and renovascular disease risk. VVD includes circadian BP over-swinging (CHAT, short for circadian hyper-amplitude tension), deficient heart rate variability, MESOR (midline-estimating statistic of rhythm) hypertension, excessively elevated pulse pressure over 60 mmHg, BP ecphasia (an odd timing of the circadian rhythms in BP but not in that of heart rate) and frequency alteration. The term MESOR-hypertension indicates only one of several VVDs that can combine to for sets of 2, 3 and n-component vascular variability syndromes.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167758","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.707573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pulse pressure","weight":0.600084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_pressure"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.564935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.505864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.373702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Heart rate variability","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"People's Party for Freedom and Democracy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Party_for_Freedom_and_Democracy"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Parity (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Chronobiology","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronobiology"}]}
