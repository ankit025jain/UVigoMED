{"id":80722,"title":"Submicroscopic infections among children with adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR).","abstract":"The aim of the study was to re-assess the treatment outcomes of Gabonese children, treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and artesunate-mefloquine (AM) and categorized by microscopy as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Dried blood spots were collected at day 0 and day 28 and stevor gene amplification was performed to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections. Plasmodial DNA was found in 27.5% (n=19/69) of the isolates collected at day 28; this proportion was 34.3% (n=12/35) in the SP group and 20.6% (n=7/34) in the AM group. This study underlines the need of an accurate and more appropriate technique such as PCR to evaluate antimalarial drug efficacy during clinical trials.
