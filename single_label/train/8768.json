{"id":8768,"title":"Toll-like receptor 2/4 heterodimer mediates inflammatory injury in intracerebral hemorrhage.","abstract":"Inflammatory injury plays a critical role in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced secondary brain injury. However, the upstream events that initiate inflammatory responses following ICH remain elusive. Our previous studies suggested that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be the upstream signal that triggers inflammatory injury in ICH. In addition, recent clinical findings indicated that both TLR2 and TLR4 may participate in ICH-induced brain injury. However, it is unclear how TLR2 functions in ICH-induced inflammatory injury and how TLR2 interacts with TLR4.The role of TLR2 and TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization in ICH-induced inflammatory injury was investigated in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH.TLR2 mediated ICH-induced inflammatory injury, which forms a heterodimer with TLR4 in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH. Hemoglobin (Hb), but not other blood components, triggered inflammatory injury in ICH via assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), but not TRIF (Toll/IR-1 domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-beta), was required for ICH-induced TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization. Mutation of MyD88 Arg196 abolished the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization.Our results suggest that a novel TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer induced by Hb initiates inflammatory injury in ICH. Interfering with the assembly of the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer may be a novel target for developing effective treatment of ICH.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752976","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.758244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.386431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"TRIF","weight":0.277158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIF"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.253023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.213619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"TLR 2","weight":0.121135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_2"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0263704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"List of human blood components","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_blood_components"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Primary and secondary brain injury","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_brain_injury"}]}
