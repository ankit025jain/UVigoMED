{"id":78496,"title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in Chinese patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is rare in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) in China.To determine the incidence of EGFR mutations in patients with LSCC who underwent surgical resection in mainland China.xTAG technology was used to detect the EGFR exon 19, exon 20, and exon 21 mutations in 132 patients with LSCC who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from 2010 to 2013.Of the 132 LSCC specimens examined, only 1 specimen was found to be positive for EGFR exon 20 mutation (0.76%). The mutation was p.T790M in exon 20. Two LSCC specimens were positive for EGFR exon 21 mutation (1.52%). The mutation was p.L858R in exon 21. None of the samples was found to be positive for EGFR exon 19 mutation.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646139","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.630374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.580865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.521125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.495188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.392511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.26279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.187112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"790","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/790"},{"name":"858","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/858"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
