{"id":23988,"title":"The association between C-reactive protein and delirium in 710 acute elderly hospital admissions.","abstract":"Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with poor outcomes. Evidence supports a neuroinflammatory etiology, but the role of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (C-RP) remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between C-RP and delirium and its severity as well as interaction with medical diagnosis.From an existing database (710 patients over 70 years old admitted to a Medical Acute Admissions Unit) we analyzed data which included C-RP levels, delirium (using the Confusion Assessment Method), and other clinical and demographic factors. Primary diagnoses were grouped (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, infection, metabolic, and other).There was a strong association between elevated C-RP and delirium (t = 5.09; p < 0.001), independent of other potential risk factors for delirium (odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10-1.58) p = 0.003). There was no significant association between C-RP and delirium severity, and between C-RP and delirium in the populations with cardiovascular disease, infection upon admission, or from the metabolic group despite an OR of 2.24 (95% CI: 0.92-5.45). There was an association in the musculoskeletal group (OR 2.19 (95% CI: 1.19-4.02)).There is an association between elevated C-RP and delirium. This is strongest in patients admitted with musculoskeletal disease but not in others, implying that C-RP is involved in the genesis of delirium in musculoskeletal disease, but that other factors or processes may be more important in those with cardiovascular disease or infection.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460925","annotations":[{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Delirium","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.238691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
