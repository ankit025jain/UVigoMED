{"id":68409,"title":"Comparison of intrarenal pelvic pressure during micro-percutaneous nephrolithotomy and conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy.","abstract":"The micro-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (microperc) is a recently introduced percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) technique that is performed through a 4.8 Fr all-seeing needle. We aimed to measure the intrarenal pelvic pressure (IPP) during microperc and compare it with the levels of conventional PNL. A total of 20 patients with 1- to 3-cm renal calculi resistant to shock wave lithotripsy were treated either with microperc (Group-1, n: 10) or conventional PNL (Group-2, n: 10) by the same surgical team. The IPP was measured during different stages (entrance into the collecting system, stone fragmentation, and before termination) of the procedures by an urodynamic machine using the 6 Fr ureteral catheter. All the variables were statistically compared between the two groups. The demographic values of the patients were similar. The operation time and duration of hospitalization were significantly prolonged in conventional PNL group (p = 0.034, p = 0.01, respectively). The mean drop in hematocrit levels was significantly lower in microperc group (3.5 ± 1.5 vs. 1.8 ± 0.8; p = 0.004). The IPP was significantly higher in microperc group during all steps of the procedure. The highest level of the IPP was measured as 30.3 ± 3.9 and 20.1 ± 3.1 mmHg in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (p < 0.0001). However, the complication and success rates were found comparable. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the level of IPP is significantly increased during microperc compared to conventional PNL. Microperc should be used cautiously in cases with impaired drainage of the collecting system.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522489","annotations":[{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.803857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.689691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.611676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.377966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","weight":0.320453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_shock_wave_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.269158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.263905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_nephrolithotomy"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Fragmentation (weaponry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"National Liberal Party (Romania)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(Romania)"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Belgian Pro League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Pro_League"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
