{"id":23811,"title":"Serosurvey of Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia felis in HIV-infected patients.","abstract":"Consistent with the effects of HIV on cell-mediated immunity, an increased susceptibility to intracellular microorganisms has been observed. Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular microorganisms. The aim of this study was to examine Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia felis infections in HIV+ population. Sera of 341 HIV+ patients were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescent assay. Age, sex, residential locality, risk behavior, stage according to criteria of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CD4+/CD8+ T cells, Hepatitis B antigen, and Hepatitis C serology were surveyed. Seroprevalences of R. typhi and R. felis infection were 7.6% and 4.4%, respectively. No associations were found between seropositivities and the assessed variables. Findings were similar to those obtained in healthy subjects from the same region.
