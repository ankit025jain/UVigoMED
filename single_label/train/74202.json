{"id":74202,"title":"An unusual breast lesion: granular cell tumor of the breast with extensive chest wall invasion.","abstract":"Granular cell tumors (GCT) are generally benign soft tissue tumors. When located in the breast, they may be misdiagnosed as more typical tumors, such as invasive ductal carcinoma, based on misleading clinical or radiologic features. GCTs are frequently found in the setting of a known malignancy. We report the case of a patient with a large infra-mammary fold GCT, the management of which required a multidisciplinary operative approach due to extensive chest wall invasion.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863566","annotations":[{"name":"Granular cell tumor","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_cell_tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.700176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Ductal carcinoma","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Inframammary fold","weight":0.4393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inframammary_fold"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.378592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.121041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Juxtaglomerular cell","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juxtaglomerular_cell"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Granularity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
