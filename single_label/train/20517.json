{"id":20517,"title":"Salmonella subtypes with increased MICs for azithromycin in travelers returned to The Netherlands.","abstract":"Antimicrobial susceptibility was analyzed for 354 typhoidal Salmonella isolates collected during 1999-2012 in the Netherlands. In 16.1% of all isolates and in 23.8% of all isolates that showed increased MICs for ciprofloxacin, the MIC for azithromycin was increased. This resistance may complicate empirical treatment of enteric fever.
