{"id":33771,"title":"Prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal imbalances.","abstract":"Prenatal array comparative genome hybridisation (aCGH) testing has by and large replaced routine karyotyping in many healthcare settings. While this will lead to more diagnoses, uncertain, unexpected or unhelpful findings are also likely to increase. This is the case for aCGH in any setting, but we discuss the particular challenges the prenatal setting generates and suggest areas that need further debate and discussion as well as some pragmatic ways forward.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792776","annotations":[{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.75749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.546188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.521808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Pragmatism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Comparative genomics","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomics"}]}
