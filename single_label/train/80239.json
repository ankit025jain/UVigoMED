{"id":80239,"title":"Reactivation of mucosal and cutaneous leishmaniasis in a renal transplanted patient.","abstract":"Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) is a chronic form of tegumentary leishmaniasis, which causes destructive lesions of nasal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal mucosa. We describe a case of leishmaniasis reactivation with simultaneous cutaneous and mucosal forms in a renal transplanted patient with no history of prior leishmaniasis. Reactivation after renal transplantation was not reported in Brazil. A 67-year-old woman receiving prednisone 20 mg/day, tacrolimus 1 mg/day, and mycophenolic acid 360 mg/day presented with nose edema with erythema and cutaneous lesions. Amastigotes were identified on biopsies and the polymerase chain reaction confirmed Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B but died 3 weeks after as a result of bacterial septic shock. In conclusion, tegumentary leishmaniasis can reactivate with simultaneous cutaneous and mucosal forms in a renal transplanted patient during the immunosuppressant therapy.
