{"id":33909,"title":"Update on primary hypobetalipoproteinemia.","abstract":"\"Primary hypobetalipoproteinemia\" refers to an eclectic group of inherited lipoprotein disorders characterized by low concentrations of or absence of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in plasma. Abetalipoproteinemia and homozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, although caused by mutations in different genes, are clinically indistinguishable. A framework for the clinical follow-up and management of these two disorders has been proposed recently, focusing on monitoring of growth in children and preventing complications by providing specialized dietary advice and fat-soluble vitamin therapeutic regimens. Other recent publications on familial combined hypolipidemia suggest that although a reduction of angiopoietin-like 3 activity may improve insulin sensitivity, complete deficiency also reduces serum cholesterol efflux capacity and increases the risk of early vascular atherosclerotic changes, despite low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Specialist laboratories offer exon-by-exon sequence analysis for the molecular diagnosis of primary hypobetalipoproteinemia. In the future, massively parallel sequencing of panels of genes involved in dyslipidemia may play a greater role in the diagnosis of these conditions.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781598","annotations":[{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.891514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.836743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.540269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.534454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.520478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.490938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.314032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.184646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Abetalipoproteinemia","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abetalipoproteinemia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Hypobetalipoproteinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypobetalipoproteinemia"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein B","weight":0.0263889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_B"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
