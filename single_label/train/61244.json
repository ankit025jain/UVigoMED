{"id":61244,"title":"Kawasaki disease: pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management.","abstract":"Kawasaki Disease, a systemic vasculitis of unknown origin with specific predilection for the coronary arteries, is the most common cause of childhood-acquired heart disease in western countries. Despite its world-wide incidence, the pathophysiology of this enigmatic disease is still under investigation. Diagnosis is made on a clinical basis, with supportive laboratory evidence and imaging. Once identified, timely initiation of treatment is imperative in order to quell the inflammatory response and decrease the incidence of long-term sequelae, specifically coronary artery aneurysms. Finally, longitudinal follow-up should be implemented based on risk stratification and individualized to each patient.
