{"id":44638,"title":"ABT-450/r-ombitasvir and dasabuvir with ribavirin for hepatitis C with cirrhosis.","abstract":"Interferon-containing regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are associated with increased toxic effects in patients who also have cirrhosis. We evaluated the interferon-free combination of the protease inhibitor ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r), the NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir (ABT-267), the nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor dasabuvir (ABT-333), and ribavirin in an open-label phase 3 trial involving previously untreated and previously treated adults with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated cirrhosis.We randomly assigned 380 patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis to receive either 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with ABT-450/r-ombitasvir (at a once-daily dose of 150 mg of ABT-450, 100 mg of ritonavir, and 25 mg of ombitasvir), dasabuvir (250 mg twice daily), and ribavirin administered according to body weight. The primary efficacy end point was a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment. The rate of sustained virologic response in each group was compared with the estimated rate with a telaprevir-based regimen (47%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41 to 54). A noninferiority margin of 10.5 percentage points established 43% as the noninferiority threshold; the superiority threshold was 54%.A total of 191 of 208 patients who received 12 weeks of treatment had a sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12, for a rate of 91.8% (97.5% CI, 87.6 to 96.1). A total of 165 of 172 patients who received 24 weeks of treatment had a sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12, for a rate of 95.9% (97.5% CI, 92.6 to 99.3). These rates were superior to the historical control rate. The three most common adverse events were fatigue (in 32.7% of patients in the 12-week group and 46.5% of patients in the 24-week group), headache (in 27.9% and 30.8%, respectively), and nausea (in 17.8% and 20.3%, respectively). The hemoglobin level was less than 10 g per deciliter in 7.2% and 11.0% of patients in the respective groups. Overall, 2.1% of patients discontinued treatment owing to adverse events.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725237","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Ritonavir","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.860997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.805151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.795801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.700094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.276157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.214864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.170086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
