{"id":78611,"title":"Quality of life assessment in patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis treated with montelukast and/or intranasal steroids: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","abstract":"This study investigated improvements in quality of life associated with eight weeks of montelukast and/or intranasal steroid treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.A single-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out. Assessments were made using the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire and symptom scales.A total of 128 patients (aged 13-51 years) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the montelukast group, patients were treated with montelukast tablets and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (n = 64). In the placebo group, treatment comprised a placebo and fluticasone propionate. The results showed significant improvements in symptom scores and quality of life scores for both groups after one month and two months of treatment, compared with baseline values; these improvements were significantly greater for the montelukast group compared with the placebo group. The mean number of loratadine tablets taken by each patient during the study period was only 0.73 for the montelukast group compared with 9 for the placebo group.The combination of montelukast tablets and fluticasone propionate nasal spray improved symptom control and overall quality of life for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis patients.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618303","annotations":[{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Loratadine","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loratadine"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.724116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Montelukast","weight":0.543186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montelukast"},{"name":"Nasal spray","weight":0.494783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.425887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.231662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.149642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Fluticasone propionate","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluticasone_propionate"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fluticasone","weight":0.0388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluticasone"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1351","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1351"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Propanoate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propanoate"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
