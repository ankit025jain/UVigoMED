{"id":78800,"title":"External carotid-to-subclavian artery bypass in stent grafting of thoracic aorta.","abstract":"A bypass between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery has been made in some patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair that covers the orifice of the left subclavian artery. However, complications associated with temporary occlusion of the left common carotid artery are reportedly not uncommon.Between January 2009 and September 2011, left external carotid-to-left subclavian artery bypass was made using a polytetrafluoroethylene graft in 15 patients undergoing a thoracic endovascular aortic repair that covered the orifice of the left subclavian artery. Adverse effects associated with the procedure were assessed, and patency of the bypass graft was determined by contrast-enhanced computed tomography before discharge and at least once during follow-up.All patients were discharged without any brain complications. All 15 bypass grafts were patent prior to discharge and during the follow-up period. One patient suffered temporary left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy postoperatively. No other sequelae were associated with left external carotid-to-left subclavian artery bypass.Left external carotid-to-left subclavian artery bypass is a promising procedure in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair that covers the orifice of the left subclavian artery.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570556","annotations":[{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.898451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Thoracic aorta","weight":0.860214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_aorta"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.323784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.154959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0751171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Laryngeal nerve","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0396407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Radial recurrent artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_recurrent_artery"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"}]}
