{"id":87464,"title":"A 6-year retrospective review of pediatric firearm injuries: do patients < 14 years of age differ from those 15-18 years of age?","abstract":"Pediatric firearm injuries are an increasing source of morbidity. Firearm injuries in adolescents are common but not well studied in younger children. The aims were to describe the epidemiology of firearm injuries in patients 0 year to 18 years old, with a case study of patients 14 years or younger for determining shooting characteristics and epidemiologic trends.Part 1 obtained data from hospital trauma registry. Inclusion criteria were patients 0 year to 18 years of age presenting from 2005 to 2010 with firearm injury and registry inclusion. Demographic and injury data were extracted. Part 2 included a retrospective review of patients 14 years or younger including hospital and emergency medical services records. Data from the group 0 year to 14 years included shooting and treatment details. Categorical variables were described using counts and percentages. Differences between the groups were assessed using odds ratios (ORs), along with 95%confidence intervals (CIs), extracted from logistic regression models.Registry query resulted in 456 patients (0-18 years), including 78 patients who are 14 years or younger. In the group of 0 to 18 years, 86% were male; 83% were black in the group of 15 to 18 years and 64% in the group 0 to 14 years. Overall death rate was 7%. Patients in the group of 15 years to 18 years were twice more likely (23% vs. 11%) to arrive via car or walk-in compared with the patients in the group of 0 year to 14 years (OR, 2.32;95% CI, 1.07-5.03). Patients in the group of 0 year to 14 years were almost four times more likely to be shot at home compared with those who are 15 years to 18 years (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.29-6.19). Patients in the group of 5 years to 9 years were six times more likely to have multiple injury sites compared with those who are 10 years to 14 years (OR, 6.26; 95% CI, 1.26-31.09). Only 13% had documented child protective services notification.Results from this study suggest that firearm injuries differ in younger patients compared with adolescents. The younger subset was more likely to be shot at home versus public settings. Hospital and emergency medical services records lacked important shooting details often found in crime scene reports, which are necessary for the development of effective crime and prevention strategies.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153054","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality
