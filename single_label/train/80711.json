{"id":80711,"title":"Phylogenetic affinities and systematic position of Entomelas sylvestris Baker, 1982 (Nematoda: Rhabdiasidae), a parasite of Breviceps sylvestris FitzSimons (Amphibia: Brevicipitidae) in South Africa.","abstract":"The genus Entomelas Travassos, 1930 currently includes nine species of rhabdiasid nematodes, eight of them parasitic in lizards and only one, Entomelas sylvestris Baker, 1982, parasitic in amphibians. Entomelas sylvestris was originally described from the Forest Rain Frog Breviceps sylvestris FitzSimons in South Africa and was not reported since. It was placed in the genus Entomelas without any specific arguments for this taxonomic decision, presumably mainly based on details of the buccal capsule morphology. We have found this species in the same host in Limpopo province, South Africa. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the newly-obtained sequence of complete ITS region and partial nuclear large ribosomal subunit (28S) gene of E. sylvestris and previously published sequences of a variety of other rhabdiasid taxa, has convincingly demonstrated that this species does not belong in Entomelas. Instead, it clustered together with the members of Rhabdias Stiles & Hassall, 1905 from amphibian hosts. Therefore, we transfer E. sylvestris into Rhabdias as Rhabdias sylvestris (Baker, 1982) n. comb. In our analysis E. sylvestris appears, albeit with weak support, as a basal/sister taxon to the rest of Rhabdias spp. which explains to some extent the differences in the buccal capsule morphology between this species and other Rhabdias spp. ","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563145","annotations":[{"name":"Amphibian","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.818705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Lizard","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Frog","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.545465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.520374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.427772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Forest","weight":0.418003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.36286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Internal transcribed spacer","weight":0.265536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_transcribed_spacer"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.243376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Phylogenetic tree","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree"},{"name":"Limpopo River","weight":0.0578226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo_River"},{"name":"28S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Honeycomb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Rain","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"},{"name":"Veganism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism"},{"name":"Limpopo","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo"}]}
