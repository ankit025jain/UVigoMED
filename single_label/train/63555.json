{"id":63555,"title":"Thrombelastography detects possible coagulation disturbance in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage with hematoma enlargement.","abstract":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has high morbidity, and hematoma enlargement (HE) causes worse outcome. Thrombelastography (TEG) measures the dynamics of clot formation and dissolution, and might be useful for assessing bleeding risk. We used TEG to detect changes in clotting in patients with and without HE after ICH.This prospective study included 64 patients with spontaneous ICH admitted from 2009 to 2013. TEG was performed within 6 hours of symptom onset and after 36 hours. Brain imaging was obtained at baseline and at 36Â±12 hours, and HE was defined as total volume increase>6 cc or >33%. TEG was also obtained from 57 controls.Compared with controls, patients with ICH demonstrated faster and stronger clot formation; shorter R and delta (P<0.0001) at baseline; and higher MA and G (P<0.0001) at 36 hours; 11 patients had HE. After controlling for potential confounders, baseline K and delta were longer in HE+ compared with HE- patients, indicating that HE+ patients had slower clot formation (P<0.05). TEG was not different between HE+ and HE- patients at 36 hours.TEG may detect important coagulation changes in patients with ICH. Clotting may be faster and stronger in immediate response to ICH, and a less robust response may be associated with HE. These findings deserve further investigation.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24425123","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.846361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.780859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.750072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.385417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cubic centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre"},{"name":"Thromboelastography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboelastography"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Triethylene glycol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"River delta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta"}]}
