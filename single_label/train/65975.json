{"id":65975,"title":"Association of endothelia nitric oxide synthase gene rs1799983 polymorphism with susceptibility to prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Genetic polymorphism of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) rs1799983 (Glu298Asp) has been implicated to alter the risk of prostate cancer, but the results are controversial. Two investigators independently searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase electronic databases up to September 30, 2013. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for rs1799983 polymorphism and prostate cancer were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with the software program Review Manage, version 5.0 and Stata 11.0. A total of 7 independent studies, including 1,792 cases and 2,411 controls, were identified. Our analysis suggested that rs1799983 was associated with prostate cancer risk in overall population under dominant model (OR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.01-1.30, P = 0.03) and allelic model (OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.00-1.22, P = 0.04). In the subgroup analysis, we detected no association between rs1799983 polymorphism and prostate risk in Caucasian population under all the genetic models. This meta-analysis showed the evidence that NOS3 rs1799983 polymorphism was associated with a risk of prostate cancer development in overall populations.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Male
