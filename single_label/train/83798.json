{"id":83798,"title":"[Reflection on the exfoliation of the tunic albuginea after the low-temperature plasma operation].","abstract":"To discuss the potential problems caused by the exfoliation of the tunic albuginea after the low-temperature plasma operation.To observe the occurrence of the tunic albuginea, exfolliating time, wound healing and its complications by following the patients received the low-temperature plasma operation from November in 2012 through June in 2013 (including 116 cases of tonsillectomy, 98 cases of adenoidectomy, 255 cases of the ablation of the inferior turbinate,8 cases of the ablation of the cyst of epiglottis, and 4 cases of the ablation of the tumor of larynx) together with reviewing the relevant literatures.The tunic albuginea exfolliated about two weeks after tonsillectomy, bleeding was found in 3 cases, one of which was related with inappropriate eating; the exfoliation about two or three weeks after adenoidectomy, without the occurrence of the narrow nostril and pharyngeal cavity adhesion; about four weeks after the ablation of the cyst of epiglottis, bleeding was found in 1 case; about three or four weeks after the ablation of the inferior turbinate, massive bleeding was found in one case after two months; and the ablation of the tumor of larynx, one with severe atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ, the theunic albuginea did not completely exfoliate four moths after the surgery and new creatures could be found, the wound looked smooth and healed well nine moths after the surgery. The full exfoliation occur four months after the surgery for one with the neurilemmoma in the left laryngeal ventricle and the new creatures could also be found. It exfoliated eighth days after the surgry for one patient with left subglottic epitheliaoid heman-gio endothelioma and it did not recur even six months after the surgery. Another one with the cyst of the left plica aryepiglottica failed to be followed. The first three patients did not suffer from such complications as bleeding, endogenous in trachea, etc.Low-temperature plasma surgery has obvious advantages, but the potential problems caused by the surgery need to be taken in accounted, especially the exfoliating time of the tunia albuginea is different after the ablation of the tumor of larynx, which is inconsistent with what the literatures reported, it could partially due to the action time of low-temperature plasma surgery with surrounding tissues.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248268","annotations":[{"name":"Adenoidectomy","weight":0.90816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoidectomy"},{"name":"Epiglottis","weight":0.886648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottis"},{"name":"Nostril","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Tonsillectomy","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsillectomy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nasal concha","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_concha"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.582755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.576564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.409197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.392424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Carcinoma in situ","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_in_situ"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.176878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Moth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Exfoliation (cosmetology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exfoliation_(cosmetology)"},{"name":"Tunic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunic"},{"name":"Chimera (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"}]}
