{"id":73587,"title":"MTHFR gene polymorphism and risk of myeloid leukemia: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"An increasing body of evidence has shown that the amino acid changes at position 1298 might eliminate methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme activity, leading to insufficient folic acid and subsequent human chromosome breakage. Epidemiological studies have linked MTHFR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1801131 to myeloid leukemia risk, with considerable discrepancy in their results. We therefore were prompted to clarify this issue by use of a meta-analysis. The search terms were used to cover the possible reports in the MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Odds ratios were estimated to assess the association of SNP rs1801131 with myeloid leukemia risk. Statistical heterogeneity was detected using the Q-statistic and I (2) metric. Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity, histological subtype, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). This meta-analysis of eight publications with a total of 1,114 cases and 3,227 controls revealed no global association. Nor did the subgroup analysis according to histological subtype and HWE show any significant associations. However, Asian individuals who harbored the CC genotype were found to have 1.66-fold higher risk of myeloid leukemia (odds ratio, 1.66; 95 % confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.49; P h?=?0.342; I (2)?=?0.114). Our meta-analysis has presented evidence supporting a possible association between the CC genotype of MTHFR SNP rs1801131 and myeloid leukemia in Asian populations.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894669","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.800568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.697613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.559889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.274731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.129477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.048312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clastogen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clastogen"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}]}
