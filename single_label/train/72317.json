{"id":72317,"title":"First report of trastuzumab treatment after postoperative Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Cardiotoxicity is a well-known adverse event of trastuzumab use but little has been documented regarding its use in patients with a history of cardiac disease.We describe a case in which trastuzumab treatment was administered to a 40-year-old female patient with early breast cancer after acute heart failure secondary to postoperative Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. After one year of follow-up with close monitoring by echocardiography, there have been no heart-related symptoms. Additional surgery was performed because of positive resection margins at first surgery, without complications, despite the risk of recurrence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.Trastuzumab can be safely administered after acute heart failure secondary to postoperative Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982372","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiotoxicity","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotoxicity"},{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.77716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.74506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.0430264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
