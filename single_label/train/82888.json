{"id":82888,"title":"Subclinical concentrations of chlorhexidine inhibit gelatinase activity of carious dentine in vitro.","abstract":"There is evidence that dentine matrix gelatinases are involved in the destruction of carious dentine after demineralization by bacterial acids. It has also been observed that chlorhexidine, in very low concentrations, inhibits the activity of these enzymes in mammalian cells. The goal of this study was to determine if the gelatinase activity of carious dentine may be inhibited by chlorhexidine in clinical use concentrations.Gelatinolytic activity was evaluated through zymography and identified by Western blot. The inhibitory effects of chlorhexidine at concentrations of 0.01%, 0.04%, 0.08% and 1% on the enzymatic activity of softened carious dentine samples were determined.In carious dentine, five bands of gelatinolytic activity were detected, with molecular sizes of 86, 75, 38, 33 and 32 kDa. The two bands of the greatest molecular size corresponded to latent and active metalloproteinase-9, respectively. Concentrations of chlorhexidine that were greater than or equal to 0.04% were sufficient to inhibit gelatinolytic activity in the observed bands of carious dentine.These results support the use of chlorhexidine in clinical use concentrations for the treatment and control of dentine caries. Our study demonstrates for the first time the inhibitory effect of chlorhexidine on gelatinases from carious human dentine.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494744","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.907678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.66243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.434501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.300382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.281209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.26028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Gelatinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatinase"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Caries","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
