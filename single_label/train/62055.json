{"id":62055,"title":"[Rythmic-pathology: the French national pathology network for thymic epithelial tumours].","abstract":"Epithelial thymic tumours are rare and sometimes difficult to classify. Since 2010, the French National Cancer Institute supports a French national network, called Rythmic, devoted to the treatment of these tumours through regional and national multidisciplinary conferences using the web. All the tumours are secondarily reviewed by a French pathology national network for classification and staging. This review focuses on the presentation of the Rythmic network, and mainly to the Pathology review process.
