{"id":41734,"title":"A reliable pancreaticojejunal anastomosis with V-Loc 180 wound closure device for soft pancreatic stump.","abstract":"Although mortality rates decreased in recent years, pancreaticoduodenectomy is still associated with high morbidity rates. Pancreatic fistula is the leading cause of morbidity after pancreaticojejunal anastomosis and commonly occurs in soft pancreas. The objective of this study is to compare outcomes of conventional modified invaginated end to side pancreaticojejunostomy with a new practical method using V-Loc 'rM 180 wound closure device in soft pancreas.Between December 2011 and August 2013, a total of 90 pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures were performed in our hospital. 28 of them were defined as soft pancreas according to attending surgeon and included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups consecutively and analysed for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) rate, length of stay, operation time, cost and particular duration of anastomosis. Pancreatic fistulas were classified according to International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) definition.1 grade A and 2 grade B fistulas appeared in V-Loc group (Group 1), whereas 1 grade A, 2 grade B and 1 grade C fistulas appeared in conventional anastomosis group (Group 2).Pancreaticojejunostomy with V-Loc suture is a convenient method in soft pancreas and can be performed safely.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901167","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.640585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.575428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.494381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"B movie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie"},{"name":"General Certificate of Secondary Education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Attending physician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attending_physician"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Invagination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invagination"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
