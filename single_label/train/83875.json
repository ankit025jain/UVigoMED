{"id":83875,"title":"[Subjective sensations indicating simulator sickness and fatigue after exposure to virtual reality].","abstract":"The study assessed the incidence and intensity of subjective symptoms indicating simulator sickness among the persons with no inclination to motion sickness, immersed in virtual reality (VR) by watching an hour long movie in the stereoscopic (three-dimensional - 3D) and non-stereoscopic (two-dimensional - 2D) versions and after an hour long training using virtual reality, called sVR.The sample comprised 20 healthy young men with no inclination to motion sickness. The participants' subjective sensations, indicating symptoms of simulator sickness were assessed using the questionnaire completed by the participants immediately, 20 min and 24 h following the test. Grandjean's scale was used to assess fatigue and mood.The symptoms were observed immediately after the exposure to sVR. Their intensity was higher than after watching the 2D and 3D movies. A significant relationship was found between the eye pain and the type of exposure (2D, 3D and sVR) (Chi2)(2) = 6.225, p < or = 0.05); the relationship between excessive perspiration and the exposure to 31) movie and sVR was also noted (Chi2(1) = 9.173, p < or = 0.01). Some symptoms were still observed 20 min after exposure to sVR. The comparison of Grandjean's scale results before and after the training in sVR handing showed significant differences in 11 out of 14 subscales. Before and after exposure to 3D movie, the differences were significant only for the \"tired-fatigued\" subscale (Z = 2.501, p < or = 0.012) in favor of \"fatigued\".Based on the subjective sensation of discomfort after watching 2D and 3D movies it is impossible to predict symptoms of simulator sickness after training using sVR.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230565","annotations":[{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.746463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.555602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Motion sickness","weight":0.545207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"},{"name":"3-D film","weight":0.432706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_film"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.423623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.398818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.392977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Perspiration","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.37219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.229115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.215389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.204014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Uncertainty principle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Immersion (virtual reality)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(virtual_reality)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
