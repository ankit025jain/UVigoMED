{"id":58672,"title":"[Characteristics of gonadotropic function in patients with pubertal uterine bleeding in the modern society].","abstract":"The character of gonadotropin changes, which have been studied in patients with pubertal uterine bleeding, enable the authors to establish that its nature depends on the body weight value against the background of uterine bleeding. The study provides evidence that only half of all patients with bleeding has normal hormone levels. Disorders in gonadotropin levels have been registered in one third of our patients. The authors have also revealed that bleeding in patients with body weight excess significantly more often is accompanied by the increased LH and PRL morning levels and LH/FSH ratio, which occurs against the background of hypothalamic-pituitary function activation. Positive effect of insulin level on the LH production has been found in patients of the above group.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908963","annotations":[{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.526043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.522519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.454562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.127891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.0363756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Modernity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Vaginal bleeding","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_bleeding"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
