{"id":63134,"title":"Case for diagnosis. Hashimoto-Pritzker disease.","abstract":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, clinically heterogeneous disease. Since there is considerable clinical overlap among the four described variants (Hand-Sch√ºller-Christian, eosinophilic granuloma, Letterer-Siwe and Hashimoto-Pritzker), the concept of spectral disease applies to this entity. The Hashimoto-Pritzker variant was first described in 1973. Characteristically, it is present at birth or during the first days of life, impairment is limited to the skin and prognosis is favorable with spontaneous resolution. We report a newborn male patient with Hashimoto-Pritzker disease presenting as a S100 + and CD1a + single congenital perianal lesion with rapid involution in two months.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474118","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.603919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Langerhans cell","weight":0.399004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"CD1","weight":0.213202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD1"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Eosinophilic","weight":0.172396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic"},{"name":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell_histiocytosis"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Involution (mathematics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Eosinophilic granuloma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_granuloma"},{"name":"Histiocytosis","weight":0.0173167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytosis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"Chiral resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_resolution"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"}]}
