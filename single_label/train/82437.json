{"id":82437,"title":"[Efficiency of mesotherapy in dental medecine. 16 Clinical cases].","abstract":"We often prescribe drugs in large quantities, it may help to relieve, but it also triggers intolerances, allergies or even digestive or skin problems. This is one reason, perhaps the main, to explore elsewhere. The reader will discover, through this article, mesotherapy; a new and simple therapeutic that aims to approximate the location of the therapeutic to the place of the pathology for greater efficiency. To test the effectiveness of this technique in dentistry, we treated by mesotherapy, 16 patients with phenomena of algo-inflammation, and as witnesses, 21 patients with the same symptoms and same diagnosis but conventionally treated by drugs prescriptions. A regression of the inflammation and an improvement in the painful condition were observed at a shorter time among patients treated with mesotherapy; it would be interesting, by evaluating the ratio \"quality/cost-effectiveness and safety\", to encourage the practice of mesotherapy in dentistry.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624641","annotations":[{"name":"Drug","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.529701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Mesotherapy","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesotherapy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
