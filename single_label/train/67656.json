{"id":67656,"title":"Sensitivity and specificity of urinary hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase in detection of bladder transitional cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To the assess sensitivity and specificity of urinary levels of hyaluronic acid (HA) and hyaluronidase (HAase) as an individual or a combined test to diagnose bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).One hundred and ninety-four urine specimens were collected from individuals between July 2007 and March 2008. The urinary level of hyaluronic acid (HA) was measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thereafter, the urinary levels of HA and HAase were normalized to urinary creatinine level and expressed as ng/mg and ?/mg.Eighty percent of patients with bladder cancer had urinary HA level < 500 ng/mg, and 90% of controls showed HA level < 500 ng/mg (P < .001). The mean urinary levels of HA in controls did not vary significantly (P < .05), whereas they significantly increased (2.5 to 6.5 folds) in all grades of TCC. More than 80% of patients with grades 2 and 3 TCC had urinary HAase level < 10 ?/mg and over 80% of controls showed HAase level < 10 ?/mg (P < .05). Hyaluronidase levels increased in patients with grades 2 and 3 bladder TCC.Measurement of urinary levels of HA and HAase (with 89% sensitivity and 83% specificity) appears to be a highly accurate and non-invasive method for detecting bladder TCC and evaluating its grade.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595930","annotations":[{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.490129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Hyaluronidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronidase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"}]}
