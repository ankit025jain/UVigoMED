{"id":1043,"title":"Variational Bayesian electrophysiological imaging of myocardial infarction.","abstract":"The presence, size, and distribution of ischemic tissue bear significant prognostic and therapeutic implication for ventricular arrhythmias. While many approaches to 3D infarct detection have been developed via electrophysiological (EP) imaging from noninvasive electrocardiographic data, this ill-posed inverse problem remains challenging especially for septal infarcts that are hidden from body-surface data. We propose a variational Bayesian framework for EP imaging of 3D infarct using a total-variation prior. The posterior distribution of intramural action potential and all regularization parameters are estimated from body-surface data by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Because of the uncertainty introduced in prior models, we hypothesize that the solution uncertainty plays as important a role as the point estimate in interpreting the reconstruction. This is verified in a set of phantom and real-data experiments, where regions of low confidence help to eliminate false-positives and to accurately identify infarcts of various locations (including septum) and distributions. Owing to the ability of total-variation prior in extracting the boundary between smooth regions, the presented method also has the potential to outline infarct border that is the most critical region responsible for ventricular arrhvthmias.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485420","annotations":[{"name":"Action
