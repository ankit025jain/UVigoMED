{"id":65779,"title":"Study of genetic variants of 8q21 and 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in Jing-Jin residents in northern China.","abstract":"To identify the genetic risk of six genetic variants at 8q21 and 8q24 (including rs1512268, A; rs12543663, C; rs10086908, C; rs1016343, T; rs13252298, A, and rs6983561, C) associated with prostate cancer in Beijing and Tianjin (Jing-jin) area residents in northern China.574 subjects were enrolled. Blood samples and clinical information were collected from histologically confirmed prostate cancer cases (n = 286) and clinically evaluated matched normal controls (n = 288) from Chinese men in northern China. Six SNPs at 8q21 and 8q24 were genotyped by high-resolution melt and sequencing in subjects. We compared statistical differences between the prevalence of risk genotypes with prostate cancer in cases and controls and analyzed the association between clinical covariates and risk loci in case groups to infer their relationship with aggressive prostate cancer.Three genotypes of rs10086908, CC (OR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.02 - 5.98, p = 0.037) rs1016343, TT (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.07 - 2.53, p = 0.023); and rs6983561, CC (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.09 - 3.63, p = 0.044) at 8q24 were identified to be associated with prostate cancer risk in Jing-jin Chinese. The D' values of both two-locus haplotypes (T-A: rs1016343 vs. rs13252298; T-C: rs1016343 vs. rs6983561) were 0.907 and 0.859, respectively, the three-locus haplotype, only TAC constituted by the loci (rs1016343, T; rs13252298, A; rs6983561, C) was also associated with prostate cancer (p = 0.033), revealing rs1016343 vs. rs6983561 with significant differences between cases and controls. According to clinical covariates and odds ratios of risk genotypes relative to non-risk genotypes, rs6983561, CC was associated with age (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.02 - 6.13, p = 0.039), and tumor aggressiveness (OR = 1.15; 95% Cl = 1.06 - 1.23, p = 0.013).The loci including rs10086908, rs1016343, and rs6983561 at 8q24 could be associated with prostate cancer in Jing-jin residents in northern China. Our results suggest that these loci could influence susceptibility to prostate cancer in the northern Chinese population.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779299","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.810201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.784244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"China","weight":0.697293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.610865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.568532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.488493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.349045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.265351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chromosome 8 (human)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_8_(human)"},{"name":"Tianjin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"907","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/907"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Cultural assimilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation"},{"name":"Northern and southern China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
