{"id":53604,"title":"Expression and significance of HIF-1 ? and VEGF in rats with diabetic retinopathy.","abstract":"To investigate the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) rats and its effect on the DR occurrence and development.A total of 120 SD rats were randomly divided into trial group and control group with 60 in each. STZ i.p. was used in the trial group to establish the DM model, citrate buffer salt of same amount was used i.p. to the control group. 1, 3 and 6 months after injection, respective 20 rats were sacrificed in each group to observe expression of HIF-1? and VEGF in the rat retina tissue at different time points.Expression of HIF-1? and VEGF were negative in the control group; expression of HIF-1? and VEGF protein in retinal tissue were weak after 1 month of DR mold formation. It showed progressive enhancement along with the progression in different organizations, differences between groups were significant (P<0.05).Expressions of HIF-1? and VEGF were correlated with disease progression in early diabetic retinopathy. Retinal oxygen can induce over-expression of HIF-1? and VEGF. It shows that HIF-1? and VEGF play an important role in the pathogenesis of DR.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507647","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.610066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.224889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Mold","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
