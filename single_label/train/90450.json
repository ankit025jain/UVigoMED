{"id":90450,"title":"Report of Galeazzi fracture resulting from a ballistic injury.","abstract":"Galeazzi fractures are a rare injury to occur in adults, which are typically associated with high energy trauma. To our knowledge, the reported cases in the literature have only been associated with motor vehicle accidents, falls from a height, or athletic endeavors. The application of the force in the setting of a Galeazzi fracture has been disputed, but it is believed to occur with the wrist in hyperextension and pronation.We describe a 27-year-old male who presented with multiple gunshot wounds that included his right forearm. The injury sustained to his right forearm resulted in a Galeazzi fracture, which after open reduction and internal fixation, demonstrated subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint in pronation.We provide a novel mechanism of a Galeazzi fracture that demonstrates a method for sustaining the fracture pattern without the wrist in the typical position of hyperextension and pronation.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614610","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.672465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.544417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.538497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.457604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Galeazzi fracture","weight":0.208017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeazzi_fracture"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Distal radioulnar articulation","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radioulnar_articulation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.0762492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.0641452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pronation","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronation"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0184773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Particle physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Ballistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Multiple gunshot suicide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_gunshot_suicide"},{"name":"Radioulnar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Radioulnar joint","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar_joint"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"},{"name":"Ballistic trauma","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"}]}
