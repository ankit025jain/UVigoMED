{"id":69609,"title":"[Clinicopathologic characteristics of sporadic renal hemangioblastoma].","abstract":"To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of sporadic renal hemangioblastoma.Two cases of sporadic renal hemangioblastoma were studied by histological and immunohistochemical staining, along with review of the literature.Both cases were presented with a renal mass during annual physical examination with an age of 40 and 45 years, respectively. The lesions located in the middle portion of the kidney with a sharp tumor border. Histopathologically, the tumors were characterized by two major components: capillary and stromal cells. Immunohistochemically, the stromal cells were positive for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and inhibin-?, and negative for CK, HMB45, Melan A, EMA, CD56 and syn. Both tumors showed a very low level of Ki-67 labeling. The endothelial cells were positive for CD34.Sporadic renal hemangioblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm, the diagnosis of which is based on the characteristic follicular architecture and an exclusion of other carcinomas of the kidney.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433731","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.746354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.70888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hemangioblastoma","weight":0.69962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioblastoma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.57761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.445754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Activin and inhibin","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activin_and_inhibin"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"European Medicines Agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
