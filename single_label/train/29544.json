{"id":29544,"title":"[The suicide mortality and alcoholism in the Murmansk oblast].","abstract":"The qualitative evaluation of suicide mortality of population of the Murmansk oblast was made concerning the age group of 15 year and older and related to alcohol consumption during 1975-2010. The technique of ARIMA was applied to analyze time-series. It is established that the alcohol consumption is related to 33.4% of overall suicide mortality, to 29.4% of female mortality and 23.3% of male mortality. The possibility of existence of the northern gradient of suicide mortality conditioned by alcohol consumption among female population is demonstrated. The stronger relationships between alcohol consumption and suicides are established in female population as compared with male population.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649607","annotations":[{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.303706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.27032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.264226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.26028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Murmansk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmansk"},{"name":"Oblast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast"},{"name":"Autoregressive integrated moving average","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"}]}
