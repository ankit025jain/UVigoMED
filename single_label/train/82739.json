{"id":82739,"title":"Clinicopathologic analysis and syndecan-1 and Ki-67 expression in calcifying cystic odontogenic tumors, dentinogenic ghost cell tumor, and ghost cell odontogenic carcinoma.","abstract":"Benign and malignant tumor cells can express altered adhesion properties, and these features can be associated with their proliferative and invasive characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate syndecan-1 and Ki-67 expression in ghost cell-containing odontogenic tumors.Clinical data were retrieved from laboratory records, and hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides and sections, labeled with monoclonal antibodies anti-syndecan-1 and anti-Ki-67 using the immunoperoxidase technique, were evaluated.Included were 21 central calcifying cystic odontogenic tumors (CCOTs) (4 associated with odontoma), 2 peripheral CCOTs, 1 dentinogenic ghost cell tumor, and 1 ghost cell odontogenic carcinoma (GCOC). Syndecan-1 was mainly expressed in cells resembling stellate reticulum and in stromal cells from the fibrous capsule. The mean Ki-67 labeling index was 4.1% (49.3% for GCOC), but it was not associated with syndecan-1 expression.Syndecan-1 is variably expressed in cells resembling the stellate reticulum, stromal cells, and basal cells and might be associated with the biology of these tumors.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534622","annotations":[{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.663739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.661137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Syndecan","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndecan"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Odontogenic","weight":0.167611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Immunoperoxidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoperoxidase"},{"name":"Stellate reticulum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellate_reticulum"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Kupffer cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
