{"id":49522,"title":"Validation of reference genes for normalization gene expression in reverse transcription quantitative PCR in human normal thyroid and goiter tissue.","abstract":"Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been recognized as the most accurate method for quantifying mRNA transcripts, but normalization of samples is a prerequisite for correct data interpretation. So, this study aimed to evaluate the most stable reference gene for RT-qPCR in human normal thyroid and goiter tissues. Beta-actin (ACTB); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); succinate dehydrogenase, subunit A, flavoprotein (Fp) (SDHA); hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase I (HPRTI); tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ); and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated in 14 thyroid tissue samples (7 normal and 7 goiter tissues) by RT-qPCR. The mean Cq and the maximum fold change (MFC) and NormFinder software were used to assess the stability of the genes. As a result, ACTB gene was more stable than GAPDH, SDHA, HPRTI, YWHAZ, and B2M. In conclusion, ACTB could be used to normalize RT-qPCR data in normal thyroid and goiter tissues.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24900955","annotations":[{"name":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.855351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.841156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.817717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hypoxanthine","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxanthine"},{"name":"Succinate dehydrogenase","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxanthine-guanine_phosphoribosyltransferase"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.504713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.484655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Beta-actin","weight":0.376579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-actin"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.352428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.208802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Glyceraldehyde","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Flavoprotein","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavoprotein"},{"name":"YWHAZ","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWHAZ"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Beta-2 microglobulin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_microglobulin"},{"name":"SDHA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDHA"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
