{"id":21458,"title":"Effectiveness and safety of high-dose tigecycline-containing regimens for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.","abstract":"Here we review the effectiveness and safety of high-dose tigecycline (200mg daily). A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Scopus databases as well as of abstracts presented at scientific conferences. Eight studies (263 patients; 58% critically ill) were included, comprising one randomised controlled trial (RCT), four non-randomised cohorts and three case reports. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated pathogen (reported in seven studies). In the RCT, response in the clinically evaluable patients was 85.0% (17/20) in the 100mg every 12h (q12h) group and 69.6% (16/23) in the 75mg q12h group (P=0.4). More episodes of diarrhoea, treatment-related nausea and vomiting developed in the high-dose group (14.3% vs. 2.8%, 8.6% vs. 2.8% and 5.7% vs. 2.8%, respectively; P>0.05 for all comparisons). Three (8.6%) and 7 (19.6%) patients died in the 200mg and 150mg daily dose groups, respectively. The cohort studies enrolled patients with severe infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and complicated intra-abdominal infections. Mortality with high-dose tigecycline (100mg q12h) in the cohort studies ranged from 8.3% to 26%; mortality in the low-dose groups (50mg q12h) ranged from 8% to 61% and depended on the severity of the underlying infection. There are limited available data regarding the effectiveness and safety of high-dose tigecycline. Most of the data come from critically ill patients with difficult-to-treat infections. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of tigecycline suggest that high-dose regimens may be more effective than low-dose regimens. Candidates for administration of high-dose tigecycline should be also defined.
