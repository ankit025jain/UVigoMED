{"id":41737,"title":"A novel triple secured technique for pancreatic reconstruction following pancreaticoduodenectomy for a soft pancreas.","abstract":"Soft pancreases are susceptible to developing pancreatic fistula following pancreaticoduodenectomy. To reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with a soft pancreas, we developed a triple secured technique. In this study, we describe the details of this technique and also report on the postoperative outcomes.The triple secured technique employed an ultrasonic dissector for pancreatic transection with skeletonizing and ligating of the small pancreatic branch ducts, duct-invagination or duct-to-mucosa anastomosis for main pancreatic duct management, and, finally, four large stitches between the pancreatic stump parenchyma and the jejunal seromuscular layer to prevent minor pancreatic leakage. A total of 28 consecutive patients with a soft pancreas who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy using our technique were included in this study.Postopetrative complications occurred in 16 patients. Grade B pancreatic fistula developed in 6 patients. However, no grade C pancreatic fistula occurred in this series. Neither any reoperation nor in-hospital mortality was observed in this series.Our triple secured technique after pancreaticoduodenectomy was feasible and safe, with an acceptable rate of grade B pancreatic fistula and no grade C pancreatic fistula for patients with a soft pancreas.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901164","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.746322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.638098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.603716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.533002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.216135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"B movie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie"},{"name":"General Certificate of Secondary Education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Topological skeleton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
