{"id":63432,"title":"Enteroscopy for the early detection of small bowel tumours in at-risk celiac patients.","abstract":"A subset of celiac patients shows a high risk for small bowel malignancies.To select celiac patients considered at risk and evaluate the diagnostic yield of enteroscopy in this context.Celiac patients were enrolled from a tertiary referral centre during the period June 2011-June 2013, based on the following criteria: (i) patients diagnosed when aged 50+ and with poor response to gluten-free dieting; (ii) low dietary compliance; (iii) alarm symptoms. The patients underwent small bowel capsule endoscopy and/or double-balloon enteroscopy. Control populations were represented by the 165 non-celiac patients undergoing capsule endoscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and the 815,362-strong population of the Italian province of Varese as a registered cohort.Fifty-three patients (19% males, mean age 43.6Â±17.4 years) were evaluated. Two jejunal adenocarcinomas and one ileal neuro-endocrine tumour were diagnosed by enteroscopy (the diagnostic yield for malignancies in the selected population being 5.7%). In the non-celiac controls the detection rate of small bowel tumours by capsule endoscopy was 0.6% (P=0.04). When compared to the registered population, the relative risk for intestinal malignancy was 1282 (95% CI, 407-4033; P<0.0001).Capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy can be considered for early disease management of a subset of celiac patients.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440311","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.681063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.596339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.570804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.449517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Capsule endoscopy","weight":0.3972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_endoscopy"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Dieting","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0537278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
