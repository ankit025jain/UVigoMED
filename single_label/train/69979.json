{"id":69979,"title":"Sensing the local environment: actin architecture and Hippo signalling.","abstract":"The Hippo network is a major conserved growth suppressor pathway that participates in organ size control during development and prevents tumour formation during adult homeostasis. Recent evidence has implicated the actin cytoskeleton as a link between tissue architecture and Hippo signalling. In this review, we will consider the evidence and models proposed for the regulation of Hippo signalling by actin dynamics and structure. We cover aspects of signalling regulation by mechanotransduction, cytoskeletal tethering and the spatial reorganization of signalling components. We also examine the physiological and pathological contexts in which these mechanisms are relevant.
