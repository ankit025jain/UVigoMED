{"id":53968,"title":"Association of diabetic autonomic neuropathy with red blood cell aldose reductase activity.","abstract":"Activation of polyol pathway based on increased activity of aldose reductase (AR) has been implicated in the development of diabetic complications including diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). The relationship between DAN and hyperglycemia-induced activation of polyol pathway is still uncertain. In the present study, we investigate the association between aldose reductase activity and diabetic autonomic neuropathy by measuring AR level in red blood cells (RBC).In this study, 145 subjects with diabetes with or without DAN and 32 subjects without diabetes have been included. All subjects have been investigated for autonomic function tests and RBC aldose reductase activity. DAN was defined if results of any 2 of the tests of parasympathetic function were abnormal. RBC aldose reductase level was determined spectrophotometrically and expressed as unit/g of hemoglobin. The values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and ANOVA test has been applied for comparison between groups.RBC aldose reductase activity was found to be significantly higher in people with diabetes with autonomic neuropathy in comparison to people with diabetes without autonomic neuropathy and healthy individuals without diabetes. Aldose reductase (AR) level ranges from 0.8 units/g Hb to 14.2 units/g Hb. The mean AR level was 8.6±2.95 units in subjects of DM with autonomic neuropathy, while mean AR level was 4.1±1.78 units and 2.0±0.89 units in people with diabetes without neuropathy and normal healthy individuals, respectively (p<0.001).High aldose reductase activity is associated with the presence of autonomic neuropathy in subjects of type 2 DM.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485209","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.830963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.715987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.711043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Parasympathetic nervous system","weight":0.399406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.294198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Aldose reductase","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldose_reductase"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Dysautonomia","weight":0.157007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia"},{"name":"Aldose","weight":0.135256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldose"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Polyol","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol"},{"name":"Polyol pathway","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol_pathway"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Divers Alert Network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divers_Alert_Network"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Doomed (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomed_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
