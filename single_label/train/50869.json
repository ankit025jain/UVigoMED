{"id":50869,"title":"Association of LOXIN, a new functional splicing isoform of the OLR1 gene, with severity and prognostic localization of critical coronary artery stenoses.","abstract":"To evaluate the association between LOXIN, a new functional protective splicing isoform of the oxidized LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) gene, and the severity of coronary artery stenoses.We analyzed 100 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 100 controls, all evaluated by a new molecular biology test using highly specific allele primers able to identify the single nucleotide variation (IVS4-14 A>G) in the OLR1 gene (Loxin Test - Technogenetics). All the patients and the controls underwent coronary angiography and, for quantitative evaluation, we used both vessel and stenosis score, and SYNTAX score to evaluate the severity of CAD. Moreover, we defined the prognostic localization of CAD as a critical stenosis (>50%) of the left main and/or proximal segment of left anterior descending artery (LAD). Finally, we evaluated a correlation with the presence of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking and family history of CAD.In this selected population, even though the 'AA nonrisk haplotype' is more frequent in the controls, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the severity of CAD or the prognostic localization of critical stenosis and the difference of IVS4-14 A>G OLR1 genotype (P > 0.05). CAD patients showed significantly higher frequencies of dyslipidemia and smoking (P < 0.05) than controls, but no significant association was found between overall risk factors and the OLR1 polymorphism.In this selected population, we did not find any correlation of LOXIN with the severity or prognostic localization of CAD on left main and/or proximal LAD.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743687","annotations":[{"name":"Polymorphism
