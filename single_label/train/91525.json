{"id":91525,"title":"A case off the bell curve: customization of the dialysis prescription--a self-report.","abstract":"In a 35+-year dialysis patient, a series of spontaneous fractures and a history of severe somatic pains of unknown origin, superimposed on a history of generally adequate laboratory values, prompted an attempt at diagnosis of the cause of the condition. The patient was on a regimen of nocturnal home hemodialysis, a 4-night, 7-hour treatment. Physicians were divided on whether the cause might be neuropathic, muscular or osteopathic.A bone biopsy was conducted to evaluate the integrity of the bones.The biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of osteomalacia - severe mineral depletion of the skeletal system. This was surprising because the hematologic laboratory values did not seem to indicate this. The calcium level in the dialysate was greatly increased, which was supplemented by moderate inclusion of sodium phosphate.The bones strengthened over time, resulting in no further fractures, an easing of general pain, and significantly improved mobility. The results demonstrate that customization of the dialysis prescription should be readily available for hemodialysis, whether treated in-center or at home.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496193","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomalacia","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomalacia"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.413243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human skeleton","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skeleton"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Sodium phosphates","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_phosphates"},{"name":"Home hemodialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_hemodialysis"},{"name":"Osteopathic medicine in the United States","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathic_medicine_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
