{"id":91340,"title":"The effects of using the Internet on the health-related quality of life in people with spinal cord injury: a controlled study.","abstract":"Prospective cohort study.To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who use the Internet versus those who don't and with a control group of able-bodied individuals. To investigate the frequency of Internet usage before and after injury. To evaluate the differences in terms of demographic features of both groups, analyze the variation in the Internet usage pattern of people with SCI before and after the injury.Istanbul, Turkey.A total of 60 people with SCI (38 Internet users, 22 nonusers) were included in the study. The control group consisted of 33 healthy persons of similar age and sex. The HRQoL was evaluated with the SF-36 Health Survey.The scores of all the subscales of the SF-36, except vitality, were significantly lower in people with SCI than those of the controls'. The bodily pain subscale and physical component scores were found to be significantly higher in people with SCI using the Internet than the nonuser group with SCI (P<0.05). The Internet usage frequency increased significantly in people with SCI after injury (P<0.05). A significant correlation was found between time since injury and Internet use (r=0.365, P=0.007).Although HRQoL scores were lower in people with an SCI, the physical status component score was better in the Internet user SCI group. As there is a significant increase in the time spent online after injury, the Internet could be an effective modality to contact and educate people with an SCI.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513723","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.706065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.483236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.34465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Istanbul","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.301981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.220455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Internaut","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internaut"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Internet access","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access"}]}
