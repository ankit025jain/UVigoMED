{"id":54576,"title":"New strategies for the treatment of ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Ovarian cancer usually responds well to chemotherapy, but once the disease becomes resistant to chemotherapy, the treatment options available are inadequate. A number of strategies are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, among which angiogenesis and PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] inhibitors appear promising. Pre-clinical studies have identified several potential new therapeutic strategies, and we review the potential for use of BH3 (Bcl-2 homology) mimetics, autotaxin inhibitors and statins to treat ovarian cancer.
