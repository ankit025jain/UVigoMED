{"id":55059,"title":"[Transient increase of intraocular pressure with primary open angle glaucoma patients associated with warm and cold seasons after long waiting time in an ophthalmology clinic].","abstract":"To retrospectively evaluate the influence of long waiting time on intraocular pressure (IOP) with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients in the waiting room of an ophthalmology clinic.We reviewed 74 consecutive patients with POAG who visited at Kaimeido Ophthalmic and Dental Clinic within the past 8 years without change of glaucoma medications, 34 men and 40 woman, average age +/- standard deviation) 67.9 +/- 13.4 years. Right eye data of all patients were enrolled and IOP was split into 4 groups, short waiting time (< 30 min ; SH30) and long waiting time (> or = 60 min; LH60) in the hot (> or = 15 degrees C) season. Short waiting time (SC30) and long waiting time (LC60) in the cold (< or = 5 degrees C) season; according to the average outdoor air temperature in Sapporo Japan. All groups were compared each other (paired t test).There was a significant difference between SH30 (14.6 2.4 mmHg) and LH60 (14.9 +/- 2.4 mmHg; p = 0.038), between SC30 (14.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg) and LC60 (15.5 +/- 2.6 mmHg; p = 3.45 x 10(-7)) and between LH60 and LC60 (p = 0.00079). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between SH30 and SC30 (p = 0.89).This retrospective study suggests that patients with POAG show a transient IOP elevation after longer waiting time, especially during the cold season.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016793","annotations":[{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.775589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.748753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.552795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.498919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.478889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.384709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.366442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.332722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.278118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.139537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Sapporo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Waiting room","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_room"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"List of highways numbered 30","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highways_numbered_30"}]}
