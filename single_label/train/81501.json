{"id":81501,"title":"Supragingival treatment as an aid to reduce subgingival needs: a 450-day investigation.","abstract":"This study investigated the clinical effects of using a supragingival biofilm control regimen (SUPRA) as a step prior to scaling and root planing (SRP). A split-mouth clinical trial was performed in which 25 subjects with periodontitis (47.2 ± 6.5 years) underwent treatment (days 0–60) and monitoring (days 90–450) phases. At Day 0 (baseline) treatments were randomly assigned per quadrant: SUPRA, SRP and S30SRP (SUPRA 30 days before SRP). The full-mouth visible plaque index (VPI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), periodontal probing depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were examined on days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 270, and 450. Baseline data were similar among all groups. From days 0 to 60, the groups showed similar significant decreases in VPI and GBI. Reductions in PPD for the SRP (3.39 ± 0.17 to2.42 ± 0.16 mm) and S30SRP (3.31 ± 0.11 to 2.40 ± 0.07 mm) groups were greater (p < 0.05) than those for the SUPRA group. This pattern was also observed for BOP. Attachment gain was similar and greater for the SRP (3.34 ± 0.28 to 2.58 ± 0.26 mm) and S30SRP (3.25 ± 0.21 to 2.54 ± 0.19 mm) groups compared to the SUPRA group. Results were maintained from day 90 forward. Overall, the S30SRP treatment reduced the subgingival treatment needs in 48.16%. Performance of a SUPRA step before SRP decreased subgingival treatment needs and maintained the periodontal stability over time.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000595","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.203291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Scaling and root planing","weight":0.122756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_and_root_planing"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"16 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Indian Reductions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Reductions"},{"name":"0 to 60 mph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_to_60_mph"},{"name":"Peter Hayes Sawyer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hayes_Sawyer"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Planing (sailing)","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planing_(sailing)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Georgia Bureau of Investigation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bureau_of_Investigation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}]}
