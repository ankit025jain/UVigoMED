{"id":61784,"title":"[Granulomatous mycosis fungoides: combination therapy with bexarotene and PUVA].","abstract":"A 74-year-old male with granulomatous mycosis fungoides presented with multiple, red-brown macules and plaques up to 8 cm in diameter, just as in classical mycosis fungoides. Dermatohistopathologic findings showed extensive granulomatous infiltrates, in which clonality could be detected in various locations via T cell receptor rearrangement. Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a very rare form of mycosis fungoides with histological resemblance to granulomatous slack skin. It shows a rather aggressive course and can be challenging to diagnose. In our case, combination treatment with bexarotene and bath PUVA, as recommended in guidelines, resulted in an impressive improvement of the skin lesions within ten weeks.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671704","annotations":[{"name":"T cell","weight":0.838718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bexarotene","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bexarotene"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.620342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mycosis fungoides","weight":0.351152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis_fungoides"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"PUVA therapy","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUVA_therapy"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"}]}
