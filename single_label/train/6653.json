{"id":6653,"title":"Genomic and phylogenetic characterization of Shuni virus.","abstract":"Shuni virus (SHUV), a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus, has in a recent study been associated with neurological disease in horses in South Africa. After its first isolation in 1966 from an asymptomatic bovine, very little attention was given to the genetic characterisation of SHUV. The association of SHUV with severe neurological disease in several horses in South Africa prompted us to determine the full genome sequence of a horse neurovirulent isolate to compare it to other members of the genus Orthobunyavirus, as well as the partially sequenced genome of the prototype SHUV strain. The availability of a full genome sequence will facilitate the development of a reverse genetics system to study SHUV molecular biology and pathogenesis.
