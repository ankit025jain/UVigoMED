{"id":81702,"title":"Factors associated with dental fluorosis in school children in southern Brazil: a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"This cross-sectional study assessed risk factors for dental fluorosis (DF) among 8- to 12-year-old children in southern Brazil. Children attending 20 schools were randomly selected (n=1,196). They were interviewed and their parents answered a questionnaire that was sent home. Prevalence of DF was 8.53% (modified Dean's criteria), and the prevalence of severe DF was 0.17%. The results of multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that DF was associated with a higher frequency of tooth brushing and with initial use of fluoride toothpaste at the emergence of the first tooth. DF does not constitute a public health problem in southern Brazil.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878674","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.465911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.173181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.167091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.146367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.143806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Dental fluorosis","weight":0.119746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Defender (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football)"},{"name":"Dean (education)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"South Region, Brazil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil"},{"name":"Tooth brushing","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing"}]}
