{"id":29952,"title":"Adverse drug reactions of spontaneous reports in Shanghai pediatric population.","abstract":"Knowledge of drug safety in the pediatric population of China is limited. This study was designed to evaluate ADRs in children reported to the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) of Shanghai in 2009.Crude ADR reports submitted to Shanghai SRS in 2009 for individuals aged from birth to 17 years (including 17 years) were included. Data were analyzed with respect to age, gender, category of ADR (System Organ Class [SOC]), the severity of reports and type of reporter.A male overrepresentation was observed regarding the total number of reports. The most frequently reported group of drugs were vaccines (42.15%). Skin rash and fever were the commonest symptoms reported in the total pediatric dataset. The proportion of children that suffered from a serious ADR was 2.16% and that for drug related deaths was 0.34%. And we found that the multiple drug exposure experienced a high proportion of serious ADRs compared with the single drug use (?Â²?=?15.99, P<0.0001). Sixty-five percent of ADRs were for children less than 6 years of age. And more than half of reports were from doctors.In our study, consumers were more likely to report new ADRs though they appear to contribute a relatively small percentage of total reports. We propose that patients would take an active role in reporting ADRs. More researches are needed in order to achieve better understanding the characteristics of ADRs in pediatric population of China.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587066","annotations":[{"name":"Fever","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.63897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"China","weight":0.556035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.498899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.244336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.242489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Petroleum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Dubbing (filmmaking)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
