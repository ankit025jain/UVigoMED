{"id":11731,"title":"Detection and partial sequencing of Schmallenberg virus in cattle and sheep in Turkey.","abstract":"To investigate the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Turkey, 116 aborted fetuses from sheep (60), goats (12), and cattle (44) collected from different regions of Turkey were analyzed by real-time PCR. SBV RNA was detected in aborted fetuses of sheep and cattle from the Marmara region, which borders the European Union. In contrast, samples were found to be negative for Akabane virus by real-time PCR. The partial sequencing of the S gene of SBV confirmed the first detection of SBV in Turkey.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576303","annotations":[{"name":"European Union","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.760555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.729552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.572992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.44917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.356484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.239106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Schmallenberg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmallenberg"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"List of regions of Turkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Turkey"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Sea of Marmara","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Akabane Station","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akabane_Station"}]}
