{"id":20095,"title":"Outbreak of AmpC ?-lactamase-hyper-producing Enterobacter cloacae in a neonatal intensive care unit in a French teaching hospital.","abstract":"We report the investigation of an outbreak of colonization by a wild-type Enterobacter cloacae and its AmpC-hyper-producing derivative E cloacae in a neonatal intensive care unit. E cloacae hyper-producing AmpC ?-lactamase isolates were found from neonate specimens and from environmental samples. All the isolates belonged to the same clone.
