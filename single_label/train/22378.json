{"id":22378,"title":"Rosmarinic acid interaction with planktonic and biofilm Staphylococcus aureus.","abstract":"The subject of study was the evaluation of antibacterial activities of rosmarinic acid (RA) on clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains obtained from catheter-related infections. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of RA were tested by broth microdilution assay. Biofilm-eradication activity was detected on 24-hour biofilm in microtiter plates using a regrowth technique; activity on biofilm formation was measured by a microtiter plate method after RA application to bacterial samples after 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours of biofilm development. RA had antimicrobial activity on all tested strains in concentrations from 625 to 1250 microg.mL-1 (MICs equal to MBCs). No biofilm-eradication activity on 24-hour biofilm was observed in the tested range of concentrations (from 156 to 5000 microg.mL-1). Subinhibitory RA concentrations suppressed the biofilm production, when applied at early stages of its development. Concentrations lower than subinhibitory stimulated the biofilm mass production in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Considering our results, RA could be a candidate for a topical antimicrobial agent with killing activity on planktonic forms of bacteria and suppressing activity in the early stages of biofilm development, but probably not for the therapy of catheter-related infections as a sole agent.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555289","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.793108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.76925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.743062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.461053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.448154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Plankton","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Microtiter plate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtiter_plate"},{"name":"Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munhwa_Broadcasting_Corporation"},{"name":"Rosmarinic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosmarinic_acid"},{"name":"Mass production","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"1250","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1250"},{"name":"Petri dish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
