{"id":43502,"title":"Effects of jianpi herbal suppository on hemorheology and CD62p in patients with ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"To compare the effects of a Chinese herbal suppository (Jianpi suppository) and Western Medicine (mesalazine) on hemorheology and CD62p in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).In a randomized trial, 120 mild to moderate UC patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. The Jianpi suppository group used Chinese herbal suppository rectally, while the mesalazine group was treated with mesalazine tablets orally. Two 15-day courses of treatment were carried out in both groups. Changes in the hemorheology and CD62p indices in patients were observed.The hemorheology and CD62p indices in the Jianpi suppository group decreased significantly more than those of the mesalazine group.Jianpi suppository is effective in improving the hypercoagulability of UC patients, and therefore may be worth using in clinical practice.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783925","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Suppository","weight":0.853583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppository"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.608164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.494889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.357706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.332313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Mesalazine","weight":0.31107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesalazine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.275016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chinese herbology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.0828226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Hemorheology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorheology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
