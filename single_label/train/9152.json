{"id":9152,"title":"Silymarin improved 6-OHDA-induced motor impairment in hemi-parkisonian rats: behavioral and molecular study.","abstract":"Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress has been shown to be associated with the development of Parkinson disease (PD). In the present study, we investigated the effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of silymarin, on 6-OHDA-induced motor-impairment, brain lipid per-oxidation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of inflammatory cytokine in the rats.The results showed that silymarin is able to improve motor coordination significantly (p?<?0.001) in a dose dependent manner. There was a significant (p?<?0.001) increase in MDA levels of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats whereas; in silymarin (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, i.p. for 5 days) pre-treated hemi-parkinsonian rats MDA levels was decreased markedly (p?<?0.001). Furthermore the CSF levels of IL-1? was decreased (p?<?0.001) in silymarin (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) pre-treated rats up to the range of normal non-parkinsonian animals.We found that pre-treatment with silymarin could improve 6-OHDA-induced motor imbalance by attenuating brain lipid per-oxidation as well as CSF level of IL-1? as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We suggest a potential prophylactic effect for silymarin in PD. However, further clinical trial studies should be carried out to prove this hypothesis.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726284","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.804907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.765224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.752786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.542446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.482254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.196183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Proinflammatory cytokine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proinflammatory_cytokine"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
