{"id":86560,"title":"Importance of preoperative anaesthetic consultation in perioperative medicine.","abstract":"This report describes two patients for whom the preoperative, anaesthetic consultation led to postponing planned surgery because of important, undiagnosed health problems. In one of the two cases, this consultation was even life-saving. However, actual literature cannot prove any advantage on the outcome of the individual patient. The only proven advantages in favour of pre-operative consultation are a reduced length of stay in the hospital and a reduction in the cost of preoperative testing.
