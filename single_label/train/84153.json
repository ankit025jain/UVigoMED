{"id":84153,"title":"Extended normothermic extracorporeal perfusion of isolated human liver after warm ischaemia: a preliminary report.","abstract":"Donation after circulatory death (DCD) livers are at markedly increased risk of primary graft dysfunction and biliary tract ischaemia. Normothermic extracorporeal liver perfusion (NELP) may increase the ability to transplant DCD livers and may allow their use for artificial extracorporeal liver support of patients with fulminant liver failure.We conducted two proof-of-concept experiments using human livers after DCD to assess the feasibility and functional efficacy of NELP over an extended period.We applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, parenteral nutrition, separate hepatic artery and portal vein perfusion and physiological perfusion pressures to two livers obtained after DCD.We achieved NELP and evidence of liver function (bile production, paracetamol removal and maintenance of normal lactate levels) in both livers; one for 24 hours and the other for 43 hours. Histological examination showed areas of patchy ischaemia but preserved biliary ducts and canaliculi.Our experiments justify further investigations of the feasibility and efficacy of extended DCD liver preservation by ex-vivo perfusion.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161022","annotations":[{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Biliary tract","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_tract"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.727568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.597719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hepatic artery proper","weight":0.172619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_artery_proper"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.0509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lacrimal canaliculi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_canaliculi"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"}]}
