{"id":84651,"title":"Feasibility and acceptability of hand massage therapy for pain management of postoperative cardiac surgery patients in the intensive care unit.","abstract":"The purpose was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of hand massage therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU).Clinical guidelines suggest the use of non-pharmacological interventions for pain management in ICU adults. The results presented are secondary to a pilot RCT evaluating the preliminary effectiveness of hand massage on pain after cardiac surgery.A qualitative descriptive design was used. Acceptability was evaluated using individual interviews with participants in both groups i.e., experimental and control (n = 40). Feasibility was examined using field notes and video recordings.While participants receiving the massage perceived it as appropriate, the control group suggested different dosages of the treatment and body areas targeted. Results also suggest that barriers (e.g. noise, numerous clinical activities) need to be overcome.Increasing staff acceptance, reducing the rest period, involving families, and repeating the treatment are avenues to consider. Building evidence for non-pharmacological pain management in the critical care setting is necessary.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064487","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.816901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.485089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.482045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.346382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.315323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.18279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Avenue (landscape)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_(landscape)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"Fieldnotes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldnotes"},{"name":"Experimental music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
