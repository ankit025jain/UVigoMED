{"id":43955,"title":"[The prognostic value of biochemical indicators under neonatal hepatitis of different etiology].","abstract":"Recently, the share of children with verified neonatal hepatitis induced by genetic predisposition, malformations of biliary tracts, inborn infections with affection of hepatobiliary system increased. The comprehensive biochemical examination of 62 children aged from 1.5 months to 2 years old with diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis. The changes of standard indicators of cytolysis, cholestasis and protein metabolism were on average moderate in group with reliable increase of protein concentration of acute phase of inflammation. The peak changes of biochemical indicators during primary examination are revealed in group of children with malformations of hepatobiliary system conditioned by viruses of herpetic group and in the process of development of expressed fibrosis of liver up to first year of life. The detection of proteins of acute phase makes it possible to objectively evaluate the presence of prolonged inflammatory process in liver and to promote prognosis of course of neonatal hepatitis in children of early age and timely correction of therapy and improvement of outcomes of disease. The detection of C-reactive protein, alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitripsin is recommended to be included into algorithm of examination of children with neonatal hepatitis.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757856","annotations":[{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.763603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.458297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.447525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.270612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Neural pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Protein metabolism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_metabolism"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"}]}
