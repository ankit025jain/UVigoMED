{"id":29820,"title":"Creatin-kinase elevation after accidental ingestion of almotriptan in an 18-month-old girl.","abstract":"Few studies have been published to demonstrate tolerability and efficacy of almotriptan in adolescents and children with migraine, particularly in the first years of life, though preliminary results are favorable. We report the case of an 18-month-old infant with elevation of serum levels of creatin-kinase after the accidental ingestion of almotriptan. A previously healthy 18-month-old girl (weight: 13 kg) was admitted to our Department four hours after the accidental ingestion of 6.25 mg of almotriptan (0.48 mg/kg), without any specific symptom. The performed investigations showed high serum levels of creatin-kinase (CK) (527 IU/L; normal values: 24-170 IU/L). Transaminase, creatinine, aldolase, myoglobin and troponin T serum levels were normal. The electrocardiogram proved negative. Initial management consisted of parenteral rehydration with saline solution. CK levels lowered significantly at 12 hours (455 IU/L) and at 65 hours (188 IU/L) after the ingestion. No symptoms were observed before discharge and on follow-up.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608586","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.880818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Myoglobin","weight":0.861929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.679338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.658307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.59951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.350765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.337377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Almotriptan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almotriptan"},{"name":"Troponin T","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_T"},{"name":"Aldolase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldolase"},{"name":"527","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/527"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
