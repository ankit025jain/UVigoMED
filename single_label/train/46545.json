{"id":46545,"title":"Acute enteritis associated with Coxsackievirus A19 in a kidney transplant patient.","abstract":"Diarrhea is a frequent complication after kidney transplantation, with an incidence rate between 22% and 51%. In many cases, the cause remains unknown. We describe here the first case, to our knowledge, of persistent diarrhea associated with Coxsackievirus A19 (CVA19) in a kidney transplant recipient. The patient was a 46-year-old man who received a deceased-donor kidney. He experienced delayed graft function because of donor kidney donation after circulatory determination of death. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of low-dose cyclosporine, high-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (3 g/day), and prednisone (10 mg/day). He had severe diarrhea for 2 weeks associated with acute renal failure. No pathogens were found in the stool cultures. Enterovirus detection was positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and sequence analysis found CVA19 (from Enterovirus C group). Area under the curve of MMF was 48 mg.h/L. Because of the persistence of diarrhea, MMF was stopped and replaced by azathioprine. The diarrhea disappeared, but serum creatinine did not return to baseline. CVA19 rarely causes gastroenteritis. This case illustrates that MMF is not always the direct cause of diarrhea, and that new clinical infectious diseases will be detected with the expansion of molecular-based DNA diagnostics.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System
