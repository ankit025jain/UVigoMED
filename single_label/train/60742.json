{"id":60742,"title":"Methemoglobinemia induced by lidocaine-prilocaine cream.","abstract":"With growing awareness of the importance of pain control in all procedures, the use of lidocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) for all ages is increasing. Lidocaine-prilocaine cream has been implicated as a cause of methemoglobinemia. Diagnostic clues may be oxygen-resistant cyanosis and an oxygen \"saturation gap\" between arterial blood saturation and pulse oximetry. Treatment with intravenous methylene blue is often effective. Since EMLA is often mistakenly considered risk-free it is routinely applied by medical staff in the emergency room. Subsequent to the case of EMLA-induced methemoglobinemia in an 8 year old girl we wish to alert the medical community to this phenomenon, and in this work review the relevant literature.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834764","annotations":[{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.740286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Methemoglobinemia","weight":0.286689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.125256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Lidocaine/prilocaine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine/prilocaine"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
