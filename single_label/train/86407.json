{"id":86407,"title":"Robot-assisted lung anatomic segmentectomy: technical aspects.","abstract":"Anatomic lung segmentectomy is a possible alternative to lobectomy for small (<2 cm) primary lung cancers. Interest in anatomic lung segmentectomy has increased further after the adoption of high-resolution computed tomography and the implementation of lung cancer screening studies, which are increasing the detection rate of small lung cancers. Robotic surgery seems well suited to the precise dissection required for anatomic segmentectomy. Initial experience of robotic anatomic segmentectomy in patients with a single primary or metastatic lung lesion is highly encouraging. The introduction of robotic staplers, aspirators, and 5-mm lung forceps will further increase precision.
