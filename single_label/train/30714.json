{"id":30714,"title":"[Fatal poisoning in the Department of Toxicology in Poznarn in 2008-2012--preliminary analysis].","abstract":"This paper presents the results of a preliminary analysis of deaths from acute poisoning, which occurred in the Department of Toxicology in Pozna? in 2008-2012. During this period, recorded 31 cases of fatal poisoning, representing 0.38% of all treated cases. In subsequent years the percentage of poisoning deaths ranged from 0.25 to 0.49%. Throughout the period leading cause of fatal poisoning were drugs (38.71%) and non-consumptive alcohols (methanol or ethylene glycol) (38.71%). In subsequent years, however, a decrease in the percentage of drug poisoning (from 75 to 0%) and an increase in the percentage of nonconsumptive alcohol poisoning (from 0% to 100%) were observed. In fatal cases were diagnosed among others olanzapine, carbamazepine, pseudoephedrine, tramadol, benzodiazepines, clozapine, morphine and benzodiazepines, insulin, verapamil, carbon monoxide and smoke fire, cyanide, Amanita phalloides, ethanol and a mixture of drugs with ethanol poisoning. The most common fatal poisoning occurred in people addicted (45.16%), mainly in alcohol dependence syndrome (35.48%). Suicidal poisoning was the cause of 32.26% of the deaths, while accidental of 19.35%. In nine cases, the procedure of diagnosis of death from irreversible cessation of brain stem function was performed in order to qualify donors of organs for transplantation or to terminate the therapy. One of the dead was liver and kidneys, and two were kidneys donors.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466679","annotations":[{"name":"Olanzapine","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olanzapine"},{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Clozapine","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Verapamil","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verapamil"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Pseudoephedrine","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.737935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ethylene glycol","weight":0.686872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Cyanide","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.674857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ethylene","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.599962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tramadol","weight":0.473784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.163079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.159096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.140264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Amanita","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
