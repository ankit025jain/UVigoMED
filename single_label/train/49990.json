{"id":49990,"title":"Pituitary apoplexy in a teenager--case report.","abstract":"Pituitary apoplexy is a rare clinical emergency which results from hemorrhage or infarction in the pituitary gland.We present a 14-year-old girl with pituitary apoplexy and review the literature.Our patient experienced blurred vision, nausea, and headache. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 and 20/20. Confrontation test visual field testing revealed bitemporal hemianopsia. Brain imaging demonstrated a suprasellar mass. The microscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach only found 5-10 mL brownish fluid-like material. Pathology confirmed no malignancy. Pituitary apoplexy was diagnosed. Her nausea and headache gradually improved. Six months after operation, her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/30 and 20/20.Although pituitary apoplexy is rare in pediatric patients, prompt evaluation including detailed ophthalmic examination, biochemical evaluation, endocrine workup, and image study are very important.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842258","annotations":[{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Bitemporal hemianopsia","weight":0.72372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitemporal_hemianopsia"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.67656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.57066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Visual field test","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field_test"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Hemianopsia","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemianopsia"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.248994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Sella turcica","weight":0.242678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sella_turcica"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Blurred vision","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.104895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Pituitary apoplexy","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_apoplexy"},{"name":"Apoplexy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoplexy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
