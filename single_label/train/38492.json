{"id":38492,"title":"[A 78-year-old female patient with dizziness, apraxia and seizure under proton pump inhibitor therapy].","abstract":"We report about a female patient with severe hypomagnesemia under therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) who presented with a cerebral seizure. Chronic use of PPIs can cause hypomagnesemia. Because of mostly unspecific symptoms which become symptomatic only with severe deficiency, the disease pattern is underdiagnosed. Hypomagnesemia is currently coming increasingly more to the forefront of medical literature.
