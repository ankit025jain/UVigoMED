{"id":50346,"title":"Protective effect of vitamin B5 (dexpanthenol) on cardiovascular damage induced by streptozocin in rats.","abstract":"This study investigated whether Dexpanthenol (DEX) improves diabetic cardiovascular function and cardiac performance by regulating total oxidant and antioxidant status.Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of Streptozocin (50 mg/kg in 1 ml of saline) and treatment groups received DEX (300 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Endothelium (in)dependent relaxation responses were assessed in thoracic aortic rings and coronary vasculature together with alpha receptor and voltage dependant contractile responses of aorta. Myocardial contractility has been recorded by an intra ventricular latex balloon. Total oxidant and antioxidant status were measured from the serum samples.Induction of diabetes resulted in an apparent body weight loss, high blood glucose, endothelial dysfunction and increased serum oxidant status. DEX supplementation restored the endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant status and body weight whereas decreasing blood glucose level.Along with the standard therapy of diabetes, DEX can be used as a safe and economical way of adjuvant therapy to diminish the burden of the disease (Tab. 3, Fig. 3, Ref. 30).","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System
