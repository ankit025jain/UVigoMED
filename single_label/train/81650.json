{"id":81650,"title":"A 4-week clinical comparison of an oscillating-rotating power brush versus a marketed sonic brush in reducing dental plaque.","abstract":"To assess the plaque removal efficacy of an oscillating-rotating power brush relative to a newly-introduced sonic power brush.This study used a randomized, examiner-blind, single-center, two-treatment, parallel group 4-week design. Subjects with pre-existing plaque scores of at least 1.75 on the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (TMQHPI) were evaluated for baseline whole mouth and approximal plaque scores. They received either the oscillating-rotating brush (Oral-B Professional Care 1000, sold as Oral-B Professional Care 600 in some regions, with the Oral-B Precision Clean brush head, D16u/EB20) or the sonic brush (Colgate ProClinical C200 with Colgate Triple Clean brush head) and brushed twice-daily with the assigned brush and a standard fluoride dentifrice for 4 weeks before returning for plaque measurements. Prior to baseline and the Week 4 measurements, participants abstained from oral hygiene for 12 hours and from eating, chewing gum and drinking for 4 hours.A total of 131 subjects were enrolled in the study at baseline, with all completing the study: 65 in the oscillating-rotating group, and 66 in the sonic group. Both brushes significantly reduced plaque over the 4-week study period. The oscillating-rotating brush was statistically significantly more effective in reducing plaque (P < 0.001) than the sonic brush. Compared to the sonic power brush, the adjusted mean plaque reduction scores for the oscillating-rotating power brush were more than five times greater for whole mouth and approximal areas.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902407","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.755214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Chewing gum","weight":0.622326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.490303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Brush","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"Brushed metal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_metal"},{"name":"Clean (2004 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_(2004_film)"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Colgate (toothpaste)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate_(toothpaste)"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Abstention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstention"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 4","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_4"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"PRR D16","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRR_D16"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"}]}
