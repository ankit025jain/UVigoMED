{"id":4483,"title":"[Problem of the choice of the probiotic dose in the physician practice].","abstract":"Currently, there is ample evidence of the usefulness of probiotics for human health, but, despite this, progress in the scientific and medical recognition of the legal force (legalization) of probiotic agents remains extremely slow. Probiotic preparations are prescribed with the preventive and medical purpose, must be not only safe, but always effective, because these properties affect the economic component of medical activity. Clinical efficacy of probiotics is determined not only by the specifics of strains, but also the adequacy of daily and course dose that should not be underestimated. Recent studies prove the identity of the impacts on human health probiotic agents and functional food products containing probiotic strains in optimal concentrations. Definition of preventive and curative doses of probiotics in children in different age periods remains a challenge for pediatricians.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518457","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.602129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.34967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Functional food","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_food"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Rule of law","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Economic policy","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Legalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalization"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}]}
