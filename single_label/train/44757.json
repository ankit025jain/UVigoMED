{"id":44757,"title":"Dissemination of hepatocellular carcinoma in subcutaeous tissue after fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).","abstract":"The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent tumor in the world, and the third cause of death related to cancer. Histological samples obtained from diseased liver likely to have HCC are currently prescribed in selected patients in whose imaging studies and tumor markers are not sufficient for the diagnosis. In recent years, a risk of tumoral seeding along needle tract of FNAC to obtain histological samples has been reported. We present a case of tumor implantation of HCC cells in the needle tract, a year and four months after a percutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719916","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.849703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.624192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.441335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0979663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"}]}
