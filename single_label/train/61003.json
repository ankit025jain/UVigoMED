{"id":61003,"title":"Robotic thymectomy for myasthenia gravis.","abstract":"Robotic thymectomy with the da Vinci robotic system is the latest development in the surgery of thymic gland. Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis is best offered to patients with seropositive acetylcholine receptor antibodies and who are seronegative for muscle-specific kinase protein. The robotic operation technique is indicated in all patients with myasthenia gravis in association with a resectable thymoma, typically Masaoka-Koga stages I and II.
