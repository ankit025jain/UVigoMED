{"id":19336,"title":"Nucleic acid detection technologies and marker molecules in bacterial diagnostics.","abstract":"There is a growing need for quick and reliable methods for microorganism detection and identification worldwide. Although traditional culture-based technologies are trustworthy and accurate at a relatively low cost, they are also time- and labor-consuming and are limited to culturable bacteria. Those weaknesses have created a necessity for alternative technologies that are capable for faster and more precise bacterial identification from medical, food or environmental samples. The most common current approach is to analyze the nucleic acid component of analyte solution and determine the bacterial composition according to the specific nucleic acid profiles that are present. This review aims to give an up-to-date overview of different nucleic acid target sequences and respective analytical technologies.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724586","annotations":[{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.770545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.638938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.594136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.303423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.232269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Analyte","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyte"},{"name":"Nucleic acid test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_test"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Alternative technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_technology"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
