{"id":22262,"title":"Active tuberculosis risk with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors after treating latent tuberculosis.","abstract":"Active tuberculosis (TB) risk increases during anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy; therefore, latent TB infection (LTBI) screening is recommended in potential TNF inhibitor users. It is unclear whether anti-TNF therapy increases the risk of active TB infection even after standard LTBI treatment.The objective of this study was to compare the risk of active TB development in LTBI-positive versus LBTI-negative TNF inhibitor users following the current national LTBI treatment guidelines for LTBI.We retrospectively studied 949 TNF inhibitor users with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases from 2005 to 2012 at the Yonsei University Health System. We compared the incidence of active TB among LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users treated according to national guidelines (n = 256) and LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users (n = 521), using Poisson regression.The active TB incidence was 1107 per 100,000 patient-years in LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users who received standard LTBI treatment and 490 per 100,000 patient-years in LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users. Analysis showed that despite this numerical trend active TB risk was not statistically significantly elevated in LTBI-positive versus LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users (incidence risk ratio, 2.15; P = 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-7.7).This study demonstrated no statistically significantly increased risk of active TB in LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users who received standard LTBI treatment compared with LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561408","annotations":[{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.836981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.586821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.330597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.306224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.221947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"TNF inhibitor","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Yonsei University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonsei_University"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1107","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1107"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_Guidelines_from_The_Medical_Letter"},{"name":"University Health System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Health_System"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Yonsei (fourth-generation Nikkei)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonsei_(fourth-generation_Nikkei)"}]}
