{"id":59211,"title":"Expression profiling and significance of VEGF-A, VEGFR2, VEGFR3 and related proteins in endometrial carcinoma.","abstract":"Angiogenesis plays a key role in the progression of various tumors, including endometrial carcinomas. Several cytokines and their associated receptors are shown to be involved, particularly VEGF-A with VEGFR1, -2 and -3.The expressions of VEGF-A, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 were studied in by immunohistochemistry in 76 endometrial carcinoma specimens. VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 receptor expression were also studied by qRT-PCR in 17 tumors in comparison to normal endometrium. The expression profiles were correlated with tumor type, grade, stage, lymphovascular invasion, disease free survival, and the expressions of other cytokine receptors (EGFR, CXCR1 and CXCR2).Immunohistochemically, 63% of endometrial cancers expressed VEGF-A, 55% VEGFR2 and 26% VEGFR3. VEGFR3 was significantly correlated with tumor stage (p=0.02), with a trend towards poorer disease free survival (p=0.09). VEGF-A was significantly correlated with microvessel density (p<0.01). Using qRT-PCR, increased expression of VEGFR2 (17.2-fold) and VEGFR3 (21.9-fold) was seen in endometrial carcinomas compared with normal endometrium, with significant correlations among the expression levels of VEGFR2, VEGFR3, EGFR, CXCR1 and CXCR2.Our study suggests that evaluation of VEGFR3 expression in tumors may provide prognostic data, and help identify patients who would best benefit from anti-angiogenic therapeutic agents. This is the first report showing correlations between the expressions levels of the different receptors.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845798","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.767032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.323722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Cytokine receptor","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_receptor"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.142852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"FLT1","weight":0.0922292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLT1"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"CXC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"FLT4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLT4"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
