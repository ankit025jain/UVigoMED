{"id":55266,"title":"Accelerated (9-mW/cm2) corneal collagen crosslinking for keratoconus-A 1-year follow-up.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of accelerated crosslinking (irradiance of 9 mW/cm; 10 minutes) in keratoconus-affected eyes through topographical, visual, and refractive end points.Mild-moderate keratoconus-affected eyes that underwent accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) treatment and had 6 and 12 months of follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. Data regarding uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), manifest refraction, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and computerized corneal topography data before surgery and post-CXL treatment were extracted and analyzed.Sixteen eyes of 14 patients were included in the study. The mean patient age was 24.9 Â± 5.8 years (range: 17.1-38.3 years). No statistically significant changes were found in the mean CDVA, mean refractive cylinder, or mean manifest refraction spherical equivalent at either time point. There was a gain of 0.13 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution lines in the mean UDVA (P = 0.012) at 12 months. All corneal parameters including Ksteep, Kflat, average K (Km), corneal astigmatism (Kcyl), and maximal curvature reading at the corneal apex (Kmax) were stable at 6 and 12 months in all patients. No complications were observed during the follow-up period.Accelerated corneal CXL is effective in stabilizing topographic parameters after 12 months of follow-up in mild-moderate keratoconus-affected corneas. Improvement in the UDVA and stabilization of all tested corneal parameters were noted after the treatment. However, a longer follow-up with larger cohorts is necessary to validate these findings.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937167","annotations":[{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.729272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.540846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.450426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.395686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.374857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.243345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.223079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.174827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.154165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Kilometre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"}]}
