{"id":85469,"title":"Preoperative transcatheter occlusion of bronchopulmonary collateral artery reduces reperfusion pulmonary edema and improves early hemodynamic function after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.","abstract":"The present study assessed the effectiveness of preoperative transcatheter occlusion of the bronchopulmonary collateral artery (PTOBPCA) in reducing reperfusion pulmonary edema after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PEA).The data from 155 patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension at Anzhen Hospital, treated from January 2007 to August 2013, with PEA were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were classified into a control (group A, n = 87) and treated (group B, underwent PTOBPCA, n = 68) group. The reperfusion pulmonary edema incidence, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit hospitalization duration, and hemodynamic function were compared between the 2 groups.Of the 87 patients in group A, 5 died in-hospital (5.7% mortality); no patient in group B died (0% mortality; P = .035). In group A, 9 patients (10.3%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after PEA; 1 patient (1.5%) in group B required ECMO (chi-square test, P = .026, ?(2) = 4.980). Group B had shorter intubation and intensive care unit hospitalization times, lower mean pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance, higher partial pressures of oxygen in arterial blood and oxygen saturation, and decreased medical expenditure compared with group A. During a mean 37.1 Â± 21.4 months of follow-up, 3 patients in group A and 2 in group B died; however, the difference in the actuarial survival at 3 years postoperatively between the 2 groups was not statistically significant.PTOBPCA can reduce the incidence of reperfusion pulmonary edema, shorten intensive care unit hospitalization and intubation duration, improve early hemodynamic function, and reduce ECMO usage after PEA.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929804","annotations":[{"name":"Extracorporeal
