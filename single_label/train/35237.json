{"id":35237,"title":"Is there any association between childhood cardiac septal defects and ROCK2 gene polymorphism?","abstract":"Rho/Rho-kinase pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular functions such as proliferation and migration. One of the possible theories of the development of ventricular septal defects is cell migration disorder. The aim of this study was to analyze the genotype distributions and allele frequencies for the ROCK2 gene Thr431Asn polymorphisms in the development of cardiac septal defects in a Turkish population. In this case-control study, 300 patients with cardiac defects (150 patients with ventricular and 150 patients with atrial septal defects) and control group (150 healthy control subjects) were investigated. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in ROCK2 gene Thr431Asn was analyzed by real-time PCR using a Light-Cycler. Neither genotype distributions nor the allele frequencies for the Thr431Asn polymorphism showed a significant difference between the groups. These results suggest that there is no association of the ROCK2 gene Thr431Asn polymorphism with the development of cardiac septal defects in pediatric patients.
