{"id":13847,"title":"Interleukin 33 is induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in keratinocytes and contributes to allergic contact dermatitis.","abstract":"Interleukin (IL) 33, a novel member of the IL-1 family, is produced mainly by epithelial cells and endothelial cells in response to various types of stress, including necrosis. The effects of IL-33 on the immune cells involved in allergic contact dermatitis have recently been revealed in vitro. However, in vivo, the induction mechanism and function of IL-33 are not fully understood.Our objectives were to investigate induction of IL-33 in keratinocytes and to evaluate the functions of IL-33 and its inducers in a murine model of allergic contact dermatitis.KERTr cells, a human keratinocyte cell line, were cultured with various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interferon (IFN) gamma. IL-33 expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting. The functions of IL-33, TNF-a, and IFN-y in allergic contact dermatitis were evaluated using a murine model.TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induced expression of IL-33 mRNA and protein in KERTr cells. Blockade of IL-33 attenuated swelling in the ears of the experimental mice. Similar effects were noted for blockade of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in these mice.TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induce expression of IL-33, and IL-33 produced by keratinocytes contributes to allergic contact dermatitis. Blockade of IL-33, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma could represent novel and potent strategies to treat allergic contact dermatitis.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Animal
