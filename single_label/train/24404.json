{"id":24404,"title":"Surgical lead extraction for total occlusion of the superior vena cava by chronic lead infection after mustard procedure.","abstract":"We present a case of total occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) with extensive thrombosis of the adjacent large veins secondary to multiple abandoned pacemaker leads with a superimposed chronic lead infection by Corynebacterium jeikeium. A surgical lead extraction was performed with an extensive en-bloc resection of the SVC together with the right subclavian vein and the right innomate vein. No venous reconstruction was required because of an unobstructed runoff via a well-developed azygos system.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438576","annotations":[{"name":"Subclavian vein","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_vein"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.323438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Azygos","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azygos"},{"name":"Corynebacterium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corynebacterium"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Superimposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superimposition"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Mustard (condiment)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment)"},{"name":"Surface runoff","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff"}]}
