{"id":73179,"title":"Population-based comparison of prognostic factors in invasive micropapillary and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.","abstract":"Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is a variant of breast carcinoma with a higher propensity for lymph node metastases compared with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).Retrospective analysis of 636 IMPC and 297?735 IDC cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End RESULTS database comparing disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) between IMPC and IDC.A higher percentage of IMPC cases (52.0%) had nodal metastases compared with IDC cases (34.6%). The 5-year DSS and OS for IMPC was 91.8% and 82.9%, respectively compared with 88.6% and 80.5% for IDC, respectively. For both IMPC and IDC, oestrogen-receptor positivity was associated with better survival, while having four or more positive lymph nodes or larger tumour size correlated with worse survival. Radiotherapy provided a survival benefit for both histological types.Despite IMPC's higher propensity for lymph node metastasis, IMPC has DSS and OS that compare favourably with IDC.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24921921","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Ductal carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.724287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.530041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.258263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"636","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/636"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"}]}
