{"id":56808,"title":"Stereotactic radiosurgery in intraocular malignant melanoma--retrospective study.","abstract":"One day session linear accelerator based stereotactic radiosurgery of intraocular malignant melanoma is a method of \"conservative\" attitude to treat posterior uveal melanoma.Retrospective clinic-based study of patients with posterior uveal melanoma in stage T2/T3 who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery at linear accelerator in period 2001-2011. Immobilization of the affected eye was achieved by mechanical fixation to the stereotactic Leibinger frame. The stereotactic treatment planning after fusion of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging was optimized according to the critical structures (lenses, optic nerves, chiasm).In group of 96 patients with posterior uveal melanoma treated with one day session stereotactic radiosurgery, patient age ranged from 25 to 80 years with a median of 54 years. Median tumor volume at baseline was 0.6 cm(3) (with range from 0.2 to 1.0 cm(3)). Median maximal dose applied was 49.0 Gy (range from 37.0 to 52.0 Gy). Secondary enucleation was necessary in 11 patients (11.5%) due to complications like irradiation neuropathy and secondary glaucoma. Tumor local control was successful in 95% of patients in 3 years interval after stereotactic radiosurgery and in 85% of patients in 5 years interval after stereotactic radiosurgery.One step LINAC based stereotactic radiosurgery with a single dose 35.0 Gy is one of treatment options to treat T2 or T3 stage posterior uveal melanoma.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Eye
