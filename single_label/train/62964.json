{"id":62964,"title":"Association of the type of 5q loss with complex karyotype, clonal evolution, TP53 mutation status, and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.","abstract":"We analyzed 1,200 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) harboring a 5q deletion in order to clarify whether the type of 5q loss is associated with other biological markers and prognosis. We investigated all patients by chromosome banding analysis, FISH with a probe for EGR1 (5q31) and, if necessary, to resolve complex karyotypes with 24-color-FISH. Moreover, 420 patients were analyzed for mutations in the TP53 gene. The patient cohort was subdivided based on type of 5q loss: Patients with interstitial deletions and patients with 5q loss due to unbalanced rearrangements or monosomy 5. Loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 due to an unbalanced rearrangement occurred more often in AML (286/627; 45.6%) than MDS (188/573; 32.8%; P?<?0.001). In both entities, patients with 5q loss due to unbalanced translocations showed complex karyotypes more frequently (MDS: 179/188; 95.2% vs. 124/385; 32.2%; P?<?0.001; AML: 274/286; 95.8% vs. 256/341; 75.1%; P?<?0.001). Moreover, in MDS unbalanced 5q translocations were associated with clonal evolution (109/188; 58.0% vs. 124/385; 32.2%; P?<?0.001), mutation of TP53 (64/67; 95.5% vs. 40/120; 40.0%; P?<?0.001), and shorter survival (15.3 months vs. not reached; P?<?0.001). In MDS, complex karyotype was an independent adverse prognostic factor (HR?=?5.34; P?=?0.032), whereas in AML presence of TP53 mutations was the strongest adverse prognostic factor (HR?=?2.21; P?=?0.026). In conclusion, in AML and MDS, loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 due to unbalanced translocations is associated with complex karyotype and in MDS, moreover, with clonal evolution, mutations in the TP53 gene and adverse prognosis.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493299","annotations":[{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Monosomy","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosomy"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Chromosome 5 (human)","weight":0.65164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_5_(human)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.503407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.438815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Chromosome regions","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_regions"},{"name":"EGR1","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGR1"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.113361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"}]}
