{"id":67977,"title":"Intratumoral heterogeneity in kidney cancer.","abstract":"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is characterized by mutation of the VHL gene and loss of a segment of chromosome 3. A new study using multi-region exome sequencing has identified substantial intratumoral heterogeneity within large primary CCRCCs, which has profound implications for understanding tumor evolution and for developing effective therapies.
