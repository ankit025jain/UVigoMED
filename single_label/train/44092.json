{"id":44092,"title":"Clinicopathological characteristics of laterally spreading colorectal tumor.","abstract":"Laterally spreading tumor (LST) is a colorectal pre-cancerous lesion. Previous studies have demonstrated distinct LST clinicopathological characteristics in different populations. This study evaluated clinicopathological characteristics of LST in a Chinese population.A total of 259 Chinese LST patients with 289 lesions were recruited for endoscopic and clinicopathological analyses.Among these 289 lesions, 185 were granular type (LST-G), whereas 104 were non-granular type (LST-NG). LST-G lesions were further classified into homogeneous G-type and nodular mixed G-type, while LST-NG lesions were further classified into flat elevated NG-type and pseudo-depressed NG-type. Clinically, these four LST subtypes showed distinct clinicopathological characteristics, e.g., lesion size, location, or histopathological features (high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and submucosal carcinoma). The nodular mixed G-type showed larger tumor size and higher incidence of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia compared to the other three subtypes, while pseudo-depressed NG-type lesions showed the highest incidence of submucosal carcinoma. Noticeably, no diffidence was detected between the lesions of homogeneous G-type and flat elevated NG-type with regard to the histopathological features. Histology of the malignancy potential was associated with nodular mixed G-type [OR?=?2.41, 95% CI (1.09-5.29); P?=?0.029], flat elevated NG-type [OR?=?3.49, 95% CI (1.41-8.22); P?=?0.007], Diameter ?30 mm [OR?=?2.56, 95% CI (1.20-5.20); P?=?0.009], Villous adenoma [OR?=?2.76, 95% CI (1.01-7.58); P?=?0.048] and serrated adenoma [OR?=?6.99, 95% CI (1.81-26.98); P?=?0.005].Chinese LSTs can be divided into four different subtypes, which show distinct clinicopathological characteristics. Morphology, size and pathological characteristics are all independent predictors of advanced histology.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751926","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.658148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Villous adenoma","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villous_adenoma"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.413124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"China","weight":0.161032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.149946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.057183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"259","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/259"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Granularity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity"},{"name":"30 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Landing Ship, Tank","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Ship,_Tank"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Shyness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
