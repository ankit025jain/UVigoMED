{"id":43170,"title":"[Non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease in a teenager misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa].","abstract":"A middle school girl started a diet; she developed an eating disorder, and was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Endoscopic examination revealed no esophagitis due to gastric reflux, but slackness was seen in the cardiac region. Multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring revealed marked non-acidic reflux. On the basis of positive symptom index (SI) and symptom association probability (SAP) values, the patient was diagnosed with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux. The patient was afraid to eat because of the reflux; therefore, laparoscopic reflux prevention surgery was performed. The symptoms completely disappeared after surgery, and normal oral ingestion was possible.
