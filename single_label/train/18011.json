{"id":18011,"title":"Antibiotic prescription practices for common infections and knowledge about antibiotic costs by private-practice pediatricians in Greece.","abstract":"Greece is among the European countries with the highest antibiotic consumption in the community. We investigated the antibiotic prescription practices by private-practice paediatricians, using the 2007 national guidelines for antibiotic use as the gold standard.A standardized questionnaire was distributed to 520 private-practice pediatricians. There were 6 scenarios about common infections.A total of 124 pediatricians participated (23.8% response rate). Compliance with the first recommended antibiotic was 48% for streptococcal pharyngitis, 30.6% for community-acquired pneumonia, 12.4% for urinary tract infection, 67.8% for bacterial skin infection, 48.8% for acute otitis media, and 18.2% for bacterial pneumonia. The highest variation in antibiotic prescription concerned the community-acquired pneumonia scenario (11 antibiotics, including 6 beyond the guidelines). The overall mean compliance rate with the first recommended antibiotic was 37.4%. The mean compliance rates were 49.2%, 36.4%, 35.8%, and 27.5% in the <40, 41-50, 51-60, and >60 years age groups, respectively (P value<0.001).Five years after the first guidelines about antibiotic use were issued in Greece, a wide range of antibiotic prescription practices by private-practice pediatricians was discovered, with only one every three pediatricians complying fully with them.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826977","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Streptococcal pharyngitis","weight":0.71905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcal_pharyngitis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.668799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Pharyngitis","weight":0.649616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngitis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Greece","weight":0.536845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.497386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.485983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.225534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bacterial pneumonia","weight":0.225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_pneumonia"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.120615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.112235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
