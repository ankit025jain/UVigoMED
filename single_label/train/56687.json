{"id":56687,"title":"Optic chiasm involvement on MRI with ethambutol-induced bitemporal hemianopia.","abstract":"While ethambutol optic neuropathy usually causes central or cecocentral scotomas, bitemporal visual field defects also have been reported. The pathogenesis of the bitemporal hemianopia has not been established. This article describes magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities involving the optic chiasm in a patient with bitemporal visual field loss. To our knowledge, these neuroimaging findings have not been previously described in association with ethambutol therapy.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647140","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.527397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.495509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.359327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Bitemporal hemianopsia","weight":0.301208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitemporal_hemianopsia"},{"name":"Optic chiasm","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasm"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.194532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Ethambutol","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethambutol"},{"name":"Scotoma","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0896747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Hemianopsia","weight":0.0453442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemianopsia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
