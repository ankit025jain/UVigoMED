{"id":20569,"title":"Variants in the IFN? transcription factor genes TBET, STAT1, STAT4, and HLX and the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in a Colombian population: a case-control study.","abstract":"Interferon gamma (IFN?) is the most potent cytokine involved in the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiological agent of human tuberculosis (TB). Patients with active TB present reduced levels of IFN?, which may explain the lack of effective immunity against Mtb in these patients. The diminished expression of or functional alterations in trans-acting factors that regulate IFN? gene expression may explain the reduced levels of IFN? in TB patients.To investigate the relationships of genetic variants in the transcription factors TBET, STAT1, STAT4, and HLX to susceptibility/resistance to pulmonary TB.Eight candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected, and genotyped in 466 unrelated pulmonary TB patients and 300 healthy controls from Colombia, and the allelic and genetic associations with TB were analyzed.The results indicate that no SNP in the transcription factors studied is associated with TB. However, polymorphism rs11650354 in the TBET gene may be associated with a decreased risk of TB; the TT genotype was significantly associated with TB protection in a recessive genetic model (OR=0.089, 95% CI: 0.01-0.73, p=0.0069), although this association was not maintained after multiple test correction (EMP2= 0.61).In this study, the rs11650354 variant of TBET was suggested to promote resistance to TB in a Colombian population. A future replication case-control study using additional samples will be necessary to confirm this suggestive association.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652136","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.816986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.805036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.734089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.702174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.700638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.548379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.438385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.293263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"STAT1","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT1"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"STAT4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT4"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
