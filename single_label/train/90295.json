{"id":90295,"title":"Assessment of medial elbow laxity by gravity stress radiography: comparison of valgus stress radiography with gravity and a Telos stress device.","abstract":"Valgus instability was reported to be higher with the elbow in 60째 of flexion, rather than in 30째 of flexion, although there are no studies using valgus stress radiography by gravity (gravity radiography) with the elbow in 60째 of flexion.Fifty-seven patients with medial elbow pain participated. For both elbows, valgus stress radiography by use of a Telos device (Telos radiography) and gravity radiography, with the elbow in 60째 of flexion, were performed for the assessment of medial elbow laxity. In both radiographs, the medial elbow joint space (MJS) on the affected side was compared with that on the opposite side, and the increase in the MJS on the affected side was assessed.For the Telos radiographs, the mean MJS was 4.7 mm on the affected side and 4.0 mm on the opposite side, with the mean increase in the MJS on the affected side being 0.7 mm. For the gravity radiographs, the mean MJS was 5.0 mm on the affected side and 4.2 mm on the opposite side, with the mean increase in the MJS on the affected side being 0.8 mm. There were significant correlations between the Telos and gravity radiographs in the MJS on the affected side, the MJS on the opposite side, and the increase in the MJS on the affected side (respectively, P < .0001). There was also a high level of intraobserver and interobserver reliability for the assessment of the gravity radiographs.Gravity radiography is useful for assessment of medial elbow laxity, similar to Telos radiography.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630547","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Gravitation","weight":0.595352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.545403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.267352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.119302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.109583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Valgus","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0106373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
