{"id":83003,"title":"Stability of Class II treatment with the Bionator followed by fixed appliances.","abstract":"This prospective study assessed the stability of Class II treatment with the Bionator, followed by fixed appliances, 10 years after treatment.The experimental group comprised 23 patients of both sexes (10 boys, 13 girls) at a mean initial age of 11.74 years (late mixed or early permanent dentitions), treated for a mean period of 3.55 years who were evaluated at three stages: initial (T1), final (T2) and long-term posttreatment (T3). A total of 69 lateral cephalograms were evaluated and 69 dental casts were measured using the PAR index. The difference between initial and final PAR indexes, the percentage of occlusal improvement obtained with therapy and the percentage of relapse were calculated, using the PAR index. The variables were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey tests.The significant improvement in apical base relationship, the palatal inclination of the maxillary incisors and the labial inclination of the mandibular incisors, and the significant improvement in molar relationship and reduction of overjet and overbite, obtained with treatment, remained stable in the long-term posttreatment period. There was also significant improvement in the occlusal relationships which remained stable in the long-term posttreatment period. The percentage of occlusal improvement obtained was of 81.78% and the percentage of relapse was of 4.90%.Treatment of Class II division 1 malocclusions with the Bionator associated with fixed appliances showed to be stable in the long-term posttreatment period.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473721","annotations":[{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.661342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.456851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.447025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.436595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.368031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.345723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.165152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.150131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.134512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Division (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)"},{"name":"John Tukey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Ligue 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1"}]}
