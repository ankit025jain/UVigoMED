{"id":86018,"title":"Equity in the receipt of oseltamivir in the United States during the H1N1 pandemic.","abstract":"We assessed the relationship between individual characteristics and receipt of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in the United States during the H1N1 pandemic and other flu seasons.In a cohort of individuals enrolled in pharmacy benefit plans, we used a multivariate logistic regression model to measure associations between subscriber characteristics and filling a prescription for oseltamivir during 3 flu seasons (October 2006-May 2007, October 2007-May 2008, and October 2008-May 2010). In 19 states with county-level influenza rates reported, we controlled for disease burden.Approximately 56 million subscribers throughout the United States were included in 1 or more study periods. During pandemic flu, beneficiaries in the highest income category had 97% greater odds of receiving oseltamivir than those in the lowest category (P < .001). After we controlled for disease burden, subscribers in the 2 highest income categories had 2.18 and 1.72 times the odds of receiving oseltamivir compared with those in the lowest category (P < .001 for both).Income was a stronger predictor of oseltamivir receipt than prevalence of influenza. These findings corroborate concerns about equity of treatment in pandemics, and they call for improved approaches to distributing potentially life-saving treatments.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825206","annotations":[{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.5594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.451181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.428984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Oseltamivir","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.291293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.116191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Lifesaving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifesaving"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Subscription business model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock"},{"name":"Sovereign state","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Influenza pandemic","weight":0.0139332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
