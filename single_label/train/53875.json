{"id":53875,"title":"Safety considerations for transplanting cryopreserved ovarian tissue to restore fertility in female patients who have recovered from Ewing's sarcoma.","abstract":"Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a highly malignant cancer in children, adolescents and young adults. The chemotherapy required to treat female EWS patients may cause primary ovarian insufficiency and infertility as a side effect. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue before the start of chemotherapy can potentially preserve fertility. When the patient has been cured and primary ovarian insufficiency has developed, transplantation of frozen/thawed ovarian tissue can restore ovarian function. The tissue is usually collected before chemotherapy is initiated, and malignant cells may contaminate the stored ovarian tissue, potentially causing recrudescence of the original cancer after transplantation. The risk of EWS metastasizing to the ovary is probably low but has not been studied in great detail. This review describes the available evidence on the risk of malignant cell contamination in the ovaries of EWS patients and presents a new case of malignant cells in an ovarian biopsy from a girl with EWS.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490613","annotations":[{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.670054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.588247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.534084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Premature ovarian failure","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ovarian_failure"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing_sarcoma_breakpoint_region_1"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Osmium tetroxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmium_tetroxide"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
