{"id":77380,"title":"Musculoskeletal pain among Polish music school students.","abstract":"To assess the prevalence and intensity of musculoskeletal pain and to estimate probability of developing playing-related musculoskeletal disorders, depending on risk factors, including gender, years of playing the musical instrument, frequency of practice (number of days per week), average daily practice time, and habitual physical activity level, in young instrumentalists.A total of 225 instrumentalists aged 10-18 years, including 107 string-players, 64 keyboardists, and 54 wind-players, were investigated. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) together with a numerical visual-analogue pain intensity scale (VAS) was used to assess the participants' musculoskeletal pain.The young instrumentalists most often complained of pain located in the neck (60.4%), wrists (44.4%), and upper (41.7%) and lower back (38.2%) areas. Girls complained of musculoskeletal pain significantly more often than the boys. A probability of the pain symptoms was increased with each consecutive year of practice (OR 1.135; 95%CI 1.021-1.261).Musculoskeletal pain in various body parts had already commenced at a young age in our sample of music students, and there was a gender difference (girls were more often affected). Results of our study suggest that an early prophylaxis of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders is needed among young musicians playing the various instruments.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925172","annotations":[{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.586128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.390163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.35827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.278771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"School","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.247804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Music school","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_school"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Musician","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Musical theatre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Nordic countries","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1018","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1018"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"261","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/261"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Keyboardist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboardist"},{"name":"Music of Poland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Poland"},{"name":"Physical activity level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity_level"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Number","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Uncial 0211","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0211"}]}
