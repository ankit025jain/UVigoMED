{"id":42700,"title":"Time-to-peak values can estimate hepatic functional reserve in patients undergoing surgical resection: a comparison between perfusion CT and indocyanine green retention test.","abstract":"To evaluate the potential usefulness of perfusion computed tomography (CT) for the estimation of hepatic functional reserve in patients scheduled for surgical resection and to compare the results with those of the indocyanine green retention test results.Thirty-one patients with hepatobiliary malignancies were included. Perfusion CT and indocyanine green retention test were performed on the same day, and their results were compared using Pearson correlation test.A strong correlation was found between perfusion CT time-to-peak values and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes and indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate values (R, 0.789 and -0.790; R, 0.832 and -0.823, respectively; P < 0.0001).Perfusion CT may be useful for the preoperative noninvasive estimation of hepatic functional reserve for patients undergoing liver resection.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834884","annotations":[{"name":"Liver","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.750813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.403582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.270796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0950163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"789","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/789"},{"name":"790","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/790"},{"name":"823","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/823"},{"name":"832","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/832"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Retention rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_rate"},{"name":"Hepatobiliary system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatobiliary_system"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
