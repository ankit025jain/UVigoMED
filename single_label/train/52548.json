{"id":52548,"title":"Sleep apnoea and its relationship with cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic and other morbidities.","abstract":"Sleep apnoea (OSAS) is a multisystem disorder. There is a high prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidities in patients investigated for sleep apnoea. We aim to evaluate any association between cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary co morbidities in patients investigated for OSAS and whether clinical findings based on Epworth sleep score (ESS) and snoring helps in diagnosing sleep apnoea. 258 consecutive patients who were electively admitted for sleep assessment in Peamount Hospital, Dublin from Sept 2009 to Aug 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. 139/258 were diagnosed as OSAS. Cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary co morbidities were 46.12%, 37.2% and 29% respectively. There is no correlation found between ESS, Snoring with Apnoea Hypopnoea Index in OSAS group. Screening for OSAS should be considered in patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. PSG is so far considered the gold standard investigation to diagnose OSAS and better clinical evaluating tools need to be formulated.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592637","annotations":[{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.549543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.548635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.408308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.333078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Dublin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"258","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/258"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Snoring","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoring"},{"name":"Paris Saint-Germain F.C.","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Epworth, Lincolnshire","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth,_Lincolnshire"}]}
