{"id":61254,"title":"[Surgical therapy for coronary artery stenosis with coronary artery aneurysm in the left main trunk due to Kawasaki disease; report of a case].","abstract":"A 56-year-old woman was admitted for ST depression in V4 to V6 in electrocardiogram. Coronary angiography showed a coronary artery aneurysm with severe calcification on the bifurcation of the left main trunk and 99% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. She did not have a history of Kawasaki disease in her childhood. She did not have any risk factors for ischemic heart disease, either. These findings suggested that the coronary artery lesions were related to Kawasaki disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention was impossible due to the location of the aneurysm which was on the bifurcation of the left main trunk. Single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting was performed for the stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. After the surgery, she was put on warfarin for the prevention of thrombus formation in the aneurysm. We report a rare case of coronary artery aneurysm due to Kawasaki disease.
