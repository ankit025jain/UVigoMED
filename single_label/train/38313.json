{"id":38313,"title":"Neonatal morbidity occurs despite pulmonary maturity prior to 39 weeks gestation.","abstract":"To compare outcomes among late-preterm or early-term neonates according to fetal lung maturity (FLM) status.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 234 eligible singletons delivered after FLM testing before 39 weeks gestation at our center over a 2-year time period. A primary composite neonatal outcome included death and major morbidities.The overall rate of primary composite morbidity was 25/46 (52.2%) and 61/188 (32.4%) in the immature/transitional and mature groups, respectively. After adjustment for confounders including gestational age, the composite outcome was not significantly different; adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.4 (confidence interval (CI)=0.7-3.0). The rate of respiratory distress syndrome was significantly higher in the immature/transitional group; odds ratio=3.4 (CI=1.1-10.3) as expected.FLM status did not correlate with the spectrum of neonatal morbidities in late-preterm and early-term births. Neonatal complications remained common in both groups.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434777","annotations":[{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.825667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.775785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.772305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.768836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.710052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.65487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.635569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.518795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.391054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.258217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Infant respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.254458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0158952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
