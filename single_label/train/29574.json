{"id":29574,"title":"[Addictive behaviours from DSM-IV to DSM-5].","abstract":"The 5th edition of the DSM was published in May, 2013. The new edition incorporates important changes in the classification of addiction.To compare the classification of addictive behaviours presented in DSM-IV with the classification presented in DSM-5 and to comment on the changes introduced into the new version.First of all, the historical developments of the concept of addiction and the classification of addictive behaviours up to DSM-IV are summarised. Then the changes that have been incorporated into DSM-5 are described.The main changes are: (1) DSM-IV substance related disorders and DSM-IV pathological gambling have been combined into one new DSM-5 category, namely 'Substance Related and Addictive Disorders'; (2) DSM-IV abuse and dependence have been combined into one new DSM-5 diagnosis, namely 'Substance Use Disorder'; (2a) the DSM-IV abuse criterion 'recurrent substance-related legal problems' and the DSM-5 criterion 'craving' has been introduced; and (2b) the criteria for (partial) remission have been sharpened.DSM-5 is an improvement on DSM-IV, but for the diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and the treatment of a psychiatric patient, classification needs to be complemented with staging and profiling.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643833","annotations":[{"name":"Problem gambling","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.848647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.748652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.664784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.418277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.390578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.314635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.228301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Gambling","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Offender profiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offender_profiling"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
