{"id":28868,"title":"Neurophysiological patterns of search and creative behavior in patients with psychoactive substance-induced disorders.","abstract":"The correlation between search and creative behavior with parameters of bioelectric brain activity was observed in patients with addictive disorders. The prevalence of ?- and ?-activities in the parietal-temporal-occipital areas of the cortex and increased ?-activity in the right hemisphere in addiction patients with high search and creative activities were associated with enhanced high-frequency activity in these brain areas. These changes can reflect the formation of a focus of pathologically increased excitation related to the pathogenic mechanisms of addictive disorders.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770736","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.674938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.556935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.45822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychomotor agitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation"},{"name":"Bioelectromagnetism","weight":0.0103371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectromagnetism"}]}
