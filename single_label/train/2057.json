{"id":2057,"title":"[Modern insights into the problem of surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis].","abstract":"Results of surgical treatment of 290 patients, suffering chronic pancreatitis, were ana- lyzed. Frey's operation was performed in 125 patients, and in 11 - the biliodigestive anastomoses formation was added for biliary hypertension. Pancreaticoduodenal resection was performed in 8 patients, the Bern's modification of Beger's operation and distal pancreatic resection - in 6 for each, longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy - in 69. In 46 patients, suffering ripe pancreatic pseudocysts, a cystojejunostomy and cystopancreatojejunostomy were performed, in 6 - endoscopic cystogastrostomy and cystoduodenostomy, in 7 - external drainage of the cyst. In 17 patients, suffering duodenal or the biliary system impassability, a bypass anastomoses were formatted.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509429","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.738423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.709591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.35861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.224504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.218332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Pseudocyst","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocyst"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Berns Salonger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berns_Salonger"},{"name":"House Frey","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Frey"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"}]}
