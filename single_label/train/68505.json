{"id":68505,"title":"Urinary albumin excretion from spot urine samples predict all-cause and stroke mortality in Africans.","abstract":"Increased urinary albumin excretion reflects general vascular damage and predicts adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Albuminuria can be determined from easily collected spot urine samples, especially in low-resource settings. However, no prognostic evidence exists for Africans.We followed clinical outcomes in 1,061 randomly selected non diabetic, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Africans (mean age: 51.5 years; 62.0% women). Baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was assessed from spot urine samples.Over a median follow-up of 4.52 years, 132 deaths occurred, of which 47 were cardiovascular related. The urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio averaged 6.1 ?g/mg (5th to 95th percentile interval; 1.2-70.0). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, urinary albumin excretion predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.48; P = 0.006), and a tendency existed for cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.97-1.63; P = 0.087), which seemed to be driven by fatal stroke (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.17-2.54; P = 0.006) rather than cardiac mortality (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.41-1.07; P = 0.094). The predictive value remained in 528 hypertensives for both all-cause (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.13-1.69; P = 0.001) and cardiovascular (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.07-1.96; P = 0.017) mortality, again driven by stroke. Our findings also remained significant after we excluded participants with macroalbuminuria, those on antihypertensive treatment, as well as participants who died within 1 year after enrollment.In nondiabetic HIV-negative Africans, albuminuria predicts all-cause and stroke mortality.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515804","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.754173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.74655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.614106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.604945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.41286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.387715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.199842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
