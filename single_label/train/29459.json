{"id":29459,"title":"[Survey of institutional staff's views concerning heterosexuality and recovery by alcoholics].","abstract":"The objective of this study was to identify how staff working in institutions for the treatment of and recovery from alcoholism view the relationship between heterosexuality and recovery on the part of alcoholics, how they deal with this relationship, and issues the staff face. Data were collected from 89 staff members (36 men, 52 women, 1 unknown gender) residing in the Kanto region and working at hospitals or local institutions. Over half the staff reported dealing with the issue of heterosexuality respectfully, but in terms of their views, a large majority of the staff was highly concerned about relapse due to heterosexuality. Half of the staff believed that heterosexuality might prevent continued abstinence. They also believed that the risk of relapse was increased further if the period of abstinence was short, the person was unemployed, both partners were alcoholics, the person had yet to admit their alcoholism, or if the relationship was an extramarital affair or with someone in the early stages of recovery. Medical staffs were more likely than other staff to respect the heterosexuality of alcoholics while being highly concerned about the risk of relapse. The results also showed that as alcoholics were unlikely to refrain from heterosexuality even if advised to do so, staff would probably use an appropriate method of guidance if one were available. These findings indicate the need to develop more practical and firmly held specialist therapies for heterosexuality among alcoholics, which has been regarded negatively as frequently leading to relapse, based on studies from the perspectives of both alcoholics and staff.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660555","annotations":[{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.701965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.654854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.557728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.446869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.40336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.27276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.229675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Affair","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair"},{"name":"Extramarital sex","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extramarital_sex"},{"name":"Kanto region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanto_region"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Refrain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Extramarital affair","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extramarital_affair"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Staffordshire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
