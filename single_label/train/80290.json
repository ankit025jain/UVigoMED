{"id":80290,"title":"[Therapeutic experience in a Chagas disease center].","abstract":"American Trypanosomiasis or Chagas Disease is a major public health problem, endemic in the American continent since prehistoric times. Its natural course is towards chronicity in the immunocompetent host, often leading to severe cardiopathy or bowel involvement. Pharmacologic therapy is restricted to two drugs and only one of them is currently available in Chile. Both have poor effectiveness in the chronic stages of the disease and cause frequent adverse reactions. Many physicians avoid their use, despite published evidences about the usefulness. We herein report the experience of our Center in the treatment of Chronic Chagas Disease in adults using the drug nifurtimox, emphasizing its degree of acceptability and its secondary effects.
