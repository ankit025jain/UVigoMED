{"id":25132,"title":"Internal iliac artery embolization during an endovascular aneurysm repair with detachable interlock microcoils.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of detachable interlock microcoils for an embolization of the internal iliac artery during an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).A retrospective review was conducted on 40 patients with aortic aneurysms, who had undergone an EVAR between January 2010 and March 2012. Among them, 16 patients were referred for embolization of the internal iliac artery for the prevention of type II endoleaks. Among 16 patients, 13 patients underwent embolization using detachable interlock microcoils during an EVAR. Computed tomographic angiographies and clinical examinations were performed during the follow-up period. Technical success, clinical outcome, and complications were reviewed.Internal iliac artery embolizations using detachable interlock microcoils were technically successful in all 13 patients, with no occurrence of procedure-related complications. Follow-up imaging was accomplished in the 13 cases. In all cases, type II endoleak was not observed with computed tomographic angiography during the median follow-up of 3 months (range, 1-27 months) and the median clinical follow-up of 12 months (range, 1-27 months). Two of 13 (15%) patients had symptoms of buttock pain, and one patient died due to underlying stomach cancer. No significant clinical symptoms such as bowel ischemia were observed.Internal iliac artery embolization during an EVAR using detachable interlock microcoils to prevent type II endoleaks appears safe and effective, although this should be further proven in a larger population.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246822","annotations":[{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.630781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.555169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.554797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.468971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.345962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.281209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Internal iliac artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_iliac_artery"},{"name":"Detachable chairlift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachable_chairlift"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Interlock (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlock_(engineering)"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
