{"id":53161,"title":"Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger and \"freeze-all\" approach in GnRH antagonist protocol.","abstract":"To report two cases with GnRH agonist triggering and a freeze-all approach in a GnRH antagonist protocol resulting in the development of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), requiring hospitalization and peritoneal drainage.Two case reports.A tertiary referral center and an obstetrics and gynecology department of a hospital.Case 1 and case 2: severe OHSS with abdominal distension, ascites development, and hemoconcentration.Case 1 and case 2: diagnosed by clinical, hematologic, and ultrasound findings. Hospitalization, IV infusion, and peritoneal drainage.Symptomatic treatment and prevention of further complication.Complete recovery.Two cases of severe OHSS after GnRH agonist trigger in a GnRH antagonist protocol without the administration of any hCG for luteal-phase support. Clinicians have to be aware that even the sequential approach to ovarian stimulation with a freeze-all attitude does not completely eliminate OHSS in all patients.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534283","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.784836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.728009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.666195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.656734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obstetrics and gynaecology","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.318068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.303648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.201457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","weight":0.171135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0677463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_antagonist"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation"},{"name":"Hemoconcentration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoconcentration"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
