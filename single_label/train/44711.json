{"id":44711,"title":"Heated and humidified CO? pneumoperitoneum inhibits tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion in colon cancer.","abstract":"Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) arising from colorectal cancer is associated with poor prognosis and few treatment options are currently available. Laparoscopic CO2 insufflation stimulates the progression and metastatic potential of gastrointestinal carcinomas. However, heated and humidified CO2 pneumoperitoneum (HH-CO2) is a promising treatment for PC, although its effects and mechanism of action in human colon cancer cells remain unclear. This study evaluated the anti-tumour effects of HH-CO2 on human colon cancer in vitro.Cell viability was assessed using the WST-8 assay in two colon cancer cell lines. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V PI flow cytometry, and migration and invasion were examined using wound healing and TranswellÂ® invasion assays. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), E-cadherin, ICAM-1, and CD44 were detected by western blotting.HH-CO2 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion. HH-CO2 induced apoptosis and significantly inhibited the expression of Bcl-2, MMP-2, ICAM-1 and CD44, and increased Bax and E-cadherin expression in colon cancer cells.HH-CO2 induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion of human colon cancer cells. Our results suggest that HH-CO2 may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment and/or prevention of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer and warrant further in vivo investigation.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System
