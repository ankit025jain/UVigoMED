{"id":16205,"title":"[VNTR-genotyping of Vibrio cholerae strains isolated from objects in the territory of Russian Federation in 2012].","abstract":"VNTR-typing of Vibrio cholerae strains isolated in the territory of Russian Federation in 2012.71 Vibrio cholerae O3 and 3 V cholerae O1/O139 strains were used in the study. Genotyping was performed by using PCR for 5 VNTR-loci.Multilocus VNTR-typing allowed to group the strains into 31 VNTR-genotypes. Genotypes were divided among 10 discrete clusters by results of a cluster analysis. The presence of tcpA gene is clearly linked with the presence of VcB locus. Each geographic region was characterized by their own VNTR-genotypes.In the course of the carried out VNTR-genotyping of V. cholerae isolated in 2012, 2 types of vibrio population formation were detected. A geographic attachment to specific regions was characteristic for most of the genotypes.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051696","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.563603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.470744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.349007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.250192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Discrete mathematics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_O3_(Y-DNA)"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}]}
