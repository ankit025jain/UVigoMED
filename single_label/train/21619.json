{"id":21619,"title":"Pancreatic stone protein - a possible biomarker of multiorgan failure and mortality in children sepsis.","abstract":"Pancreatic stone protein (PSP)/regenerating protein 1-alpha (reg) is associated with inflammation, infection, and other disease-related stimuli. The prognostic value of PSP/reg among critically ill pediatric patients is unknown. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate PSP/reg in children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis. Prospective observational study, a five day evaluation period in children 0-19years old with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or septic state. Blood tests to determine levels of PSP/reg were obtained as long as the patient met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis. PSP/reg levels did not differ between patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and septic condition until organ dysfunction signs were present. PSP/reg levels were significantly higher in patients with a PELOD score of 12 or higher or in those with MODS. Patients who died tended to have higher PSP/reg levels.
