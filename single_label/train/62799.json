{"id":62799,"title":"Rituximab-vincristine chemotherapy-induced acute anterior wall myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock.","abstract":"We present a case of an elderly man with coronary artery disease who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Soon after the administration of chemotherapy, which included rituximab and vincristine, he developed acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. The condition was managed successfully with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We briefly discuss the possible pathogenic mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced ischemic syndrome and the management of chemotherapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk.
