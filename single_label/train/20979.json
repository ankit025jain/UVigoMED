{"id":20979,"title":"Recurrent invasive pneumococcal disease in children: epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical aspects from a Danish 33-year nationwide survey (1980-2013).","abstract":"Pneumococcal diseases play a major role in human morbidity and mortality. We present the results of a Danish nationwide study of recurrent paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease (rIPD) focusing on the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical aspects.All laboratory-confirmed cases of IPD in children aged 0-15 y were identified from the Neisseria and Streptococcus Reference Laboratory, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark for the period 1980-2013. rIPD was defined as isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from any normally sterile site ? 30 days after an initial positive culture. Clinical data were obtained for all children with rIPD.Of all children with IPD, 2.4% (59/2418) experienced at least 1 episode of rIPD, and an underlying condition was documented in 39 (66%). Immune deficiency due to transplantation (n = 9) was the most common disease; however, anatomic abnormalities (n = 8), complement C2 deficiency (n = 4), and congenital asplenia (n = 3) were all registered more than once. No underlying disease was detected in 18 children (31%). Based on the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae isolates in rIPD among children aged 0-5 y (n = 41), 51%, 66%, and 78% of the cases would have been covered by the 7-, 10-, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, respectively.Of children with an IPD episode, 2.4% experienced rIPD, and an underlying disease was documented in 66% of these children. Investigation of underlying conditions is essential in episodes of rIPD.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628485","annotations":[{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.807234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.608356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.589005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.588611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.530571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Asplenia","weight":0.50277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asplenia"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.371901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.366522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.275614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Neisseria","weight":0.221729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Statens Serum Institut","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statens_Serum_Institut"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"}]}
