{"id":90782,"title":"[Criteria for initiation of pharmacological treatment by Japanese 2011 guidelines for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis].","abstract":"The goals of osteoporosis treatment are prevention of fracture. If the patients with higher risk of fragility fractures are treated, the larger effect on reduction of the risk of fragility fractures is expected. Criteria for initiating pharmacological treatment in U.S.A or Europe are based on cost-effectiveness. In Japan, the criteria for initiating pharmacological treatment to prevent fragility fracture were established in the revised version of 2011 guidelines for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In these criteria, postmenopausal women and men age 50 and older with vertebral fracture are considered for treatment regardless of bone density. FRAXÂ® was newly introduced to consider whether or not to initiate pharmacological treatment in persons without a fragility fracture who have a low bone mass.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576930","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.525932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.439379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.31369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.297559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0199414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"}]}
