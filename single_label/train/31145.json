{"id":31145,"title":"Association between the HLA-B*15:02 allele and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis in Han individuals of northeastern China.","abstract":"This study examined the significant association between carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and HLA-B*15:02 in epilepsy patients of Han ethnicity living in northeastern China.CBZ-SJS/TEN patients and CBZ-tolerant control patients were genotyped for HLA-B*15:02 by PCR amplification using sequence-specific primers. Patients then were evaluated for HLA genotypes using PCR with sequence-based typing.Eight of 35 CBZ-SJS/TEN patients carried HLA-B*15:02 (22.9%) versus 2 of 125 in CBZ-tolerant control patients (OR = 18.222, 95% CI = 3.662-90.662, p = 0.000). Our results suggest that HLA-B*15:02 is necessary but is not sufficient to produce SJS/TEN following CBZ treatment among Han individuals from northeastern China. Other HLA alleles, including A*33:03, B*58:01, C*03:02, DQB1*03:03, and DRB1*07:01 may be associated weakly with CBZ-SJS/TEN.Our results are not consistent with previous studies reporting a strong association between HLA-B*15:02 and CBZ-SJS/TEN among individuals from southern, southwestern, and central China. Other genes may be more tightly associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN. Screening for HLA-B*15:02 still may be recommended for patients in northeastern China before starting CBZ.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399721","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.899329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"China","weight":0.647406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.621832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.592032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.531015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.252191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"A33 road","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A33_road"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"662","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/662"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Northeast China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China"},{"name":"Toxic epidermal necrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"C3","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3"},{"name":"Douay-Rheims Bible","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douay-Rheims_Bible"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"South West India","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_India"},{"name":"Volvo B58","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_B58"}]}
