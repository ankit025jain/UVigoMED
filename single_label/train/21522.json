{"id":21522,"title":"[A review of treatment outcomes for intracranial abscess at our institution].","abstract":"Intracranial abscesses account for 2% of the intracranial mass even in advanced countries. Because of the variety of causative organisms and symptoms, a standard treatment for intracranial abscess has not yet been established.We retrospectively reviewed the treatment outcomes for intracranial brain abscess and subdural abscess to assess the risk factors for poor prognosis and problems related to treatment.In total, 28 patients were included in this study. Preceding craniocervical infections were found in 35.7% of patients. In 39.3% of patients, causative organisms were not identified. The treatment outcome evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale was 0 in 17 patients, 1 in 1 patient, 2 in 2 patients, 4 in 3 patients, 5 in 1 patient, and 6 in 4 patients. All mortality was noted in patients older than 60 years. Advanced age and the development of ventriculitis were significantly associated with poor outcome, i.e., a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 or worse. In contrast, the presence of fever or headache as initial symptoms, severity of neurological deficit, location of the abscess, and lack of identification of causative organism were not related to poor outcome. Compared with our previous treatment results, diffusion-weighted MR imaging has significantly contributed to the improvement of outcomes.Early administration of antibiotic therapy based on MR findings was critical in obtaining a good outcome in the treatment of brain abscess. Based on our experience, treatment should be continued, even for patients in a critical condition.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598870","annotations":[{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.932538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.84284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.748228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.264373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Brain abscess","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_abscess"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.117838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0372292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Modified Rankin Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Rankin_Scale"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
