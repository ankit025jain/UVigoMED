{"id":24485,"title":"[Preliminary clinical results of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty in the treatment deep infectious purulent keratitis].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical results of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) assisted by big bubble technique in the treatment of deep infectious purulent keratitis.Seventeen patients (17 eyes) with deep infectious purulent keratitis received DALK surgery in Shandong Eye Hospital from January 2011 to March 2012. Case selection:Patients with purulent keratitis, the infection or infiltrate depth was more than four fifth corneal thickness;Use DALK assisted by big bubble technique to cut off the lesions and expose the Descemet's membrane. The prepared donor which stored in D-X medium or in glycerine preoperatively was oversized by 0.25 mm, and after stripping of Descemet's membrane, the donor button was interrupted sutured with 10-0 nylon suture. The perioperative complications, recurrence, graft status and visual recovery were evaluated.The mean follow up time were 9 months.17 patients with average age of (46 ± 13) year old received DALK surgery, including 14 cases of fungal keratitis and 3 cases of bacteria keratitis. Perioperative complications:Two cases suffered micro perforation and were continuing performed DALK surgery after injecting air bubble in the anterior chamber. Three cases suffered double anterior chamber, one was resolved after graft resuture, and the other two were absorbed automatically.One patient suffered fungal recurrence and cured with secondary penetrating keratoplasty. Graft status:All grafts attached closely to the recipients, slit lamp and AS-OCT examinations were difficult to distinguish the interface. All of grafts were transparent. Visual acuity:before the operation best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in patients with HM/20 cm to 3.7, after the surgery patients' BSCVA improved to 4.5-5.0. The mean astigmatism postoperatively of 16 cases received successful DALK finally was (4.53 ± 2.35) D .For patients with deep infectious purulent keratitis, big bubble technique assistants DALK surgery is still a safe and effective method.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433689","annotations":[{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.897855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.71559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Slit lamp","weight":0.705736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit_lamp"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.512648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.445761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Nylon","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.251631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Fungal keratitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal_keratitis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Incandescent light bulb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Liquid bubble","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble"}]}
