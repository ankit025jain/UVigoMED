{"id":78572,"title":"Pediatric vocal fold immobility: natural history and the need for long-term follow-up.","abstract":"IMPORTANCE The clinical course and outcomes of pediatric vocal fold immobility (VFI) vary widely in the literature, and follow-up in these patients varies accordingly. A better understanding of the natural history of pediatric VFI is crucial to improved management. OBJECTIVE To characterize the natural history of pediatric VFI, including symptoms and rates of resolution and surgical intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective review at an academically affiliated private pediatric otolaryngology practice in a metropolitan area of all patients seen between July 15, 2001, and September 1, 2012, with a diagnosis of complete or partial VFI. After elimination of 92 incomplete or duplicate files, 404 patient records were reviewed for demographic characteristics, etiologies, symptoms, follow-up, resolution, and interventions. Follow-up records were available for 362 patients (89.6%). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Resolution of VFI confirmed by repeated laryngoscopy, length of follow-up, and surgical intervention rates. RESULTS Among the 404 patients, left VFI was present in 66.8%, right VFI in 7.9%, and bilateral VFI in 25.3%. Median (range) age at presentation was 2.9 (0-528.1) months. Major etiological categories included cardiac surgery in 68.8%, idiopathic immobility in 21.0%, and neurologic disease in 7.4%. At presentation, 61.4%experienced dysphonia, 54.0%respiratory symptoms, and 49.5%dysphagia. Tracheotomy was performed in 25.7%and gastrostomy in 40.8%. Median (range) duration of follow-up among the 89.6%of patients with follow-up was 17.2 (0.2-173.5) months. Resolution evidenced by laryngoscopy was found in 28.0%, with a median (range) time to resolution of 4.3 (0.4-38.7) months. In patients without laryngoscopic resolution, median follow-up was 26.0 months, and 28.9% reported symptomatic resolution. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The natural history of pediatric VFI involves substantial morbidity, with lasting symptoms and considerable rates of surgical intervention. In this large database, the majority of patients did not experience resolution. This suggests a need for more regimented follow-up in these patients, a recommendation for which is proposed here.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626342","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.733699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.649202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.551941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Gastrostomy","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrostomy"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.338871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"History","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"July 15","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_15"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
