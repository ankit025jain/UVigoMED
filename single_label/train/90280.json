{"id":90280,"title":"Modular necks in primary hip arthroplasty without anatomical deformity: no clear benefit on restoration of hip geometry and dislocation rate. An exploratory study.","abstract":"Modular necks were introduced in total hip arthroplasty (THA) to improve restoration of hip-geometry and reduce dislocation-rates. This presumed advantage was evaluated retrospectively for patients with arthritis in otherwise anatomically normal hips. Restoration of hip-geometry was assessed on preoperative and postoperative calibrated radiographs in 95 consecutive primary THAs with a modular neck design and compared with 95 match controlled THAs with a similar monoblock stem. No significant differences were seen in restoration of body moment arm, leg length and cupangle. Offset restoration revealed a borderline significant difference (P = 0.48) with higher values for the monoblock stem. In both groups 4 dislocations within one year were encountered. In this study modular necks did not reveal a clear benefit in restoring hip geometry and dislocation rate after straightforward THA.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631128","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.592413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.587906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.449282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Calibration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Restoration (England)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_(England)"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
