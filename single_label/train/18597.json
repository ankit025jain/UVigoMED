{"id":18597,"title":"Is biofilm production a predictor of catheter-related candidemia?","abstract":"Catheter-related candidemia (CRC) is typically a biofilm related disease, but it is mostly unknown if the production of biofilm is a feature exclusively shown by Candida spp. isolates causing CRC. We performed an in vitro biofilm assay using Candida isolates obtained from the blood of patients with candidemia. We demonstrated that biofilm production was not a good predictor of catheter-related candidemia. Also, we demonstrated that there was no difference in the mortality of candidemia patients infected by biofilm-forming isolates and those in which the infection is caused by nonbiofilm-forming species.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782103","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.738783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.610857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.565644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.481203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.20651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.0783118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"}]}
