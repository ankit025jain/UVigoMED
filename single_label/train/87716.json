{"id":87716,"title":"Survivors of brain injury: the narrative experiences of being a college or university student.","abstract":"The deficits associated with a brain injury may pose many challenges to young adult students.The purpose of this study was to conduct an in-depth exploration of the experiences and processes individuals who self-identify as having a brain injury go through during college or university to overcome obstacles.This study used a basic interpretative qualitative design. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed with the constant comparative method.Three themes emerged: balancing act, reality versus injury, and square peg in a round hole. Participants discussed personal strategies that they used to help them be successful. Despite these strategies, the participants continued to feel out of place and felt that seeking disability services would further set them apart from their non-injured peers.Individuals post-brain injury may benefit from occupational therapy services to reduce the challenges associated with functioning in the student role in college and university environments.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004585","annotations":[{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"University","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.499095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"College","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.147699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Historical linguistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics"},{"name":"Square peg in a round hole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_peg_in_a_round_hole"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Survivors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivors"},{"name":"Comparative literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_literature"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Young-adult fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young-adult_fiction"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Adult education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_education"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
