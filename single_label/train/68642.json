{"id":68642,"title":"Kidney donor risk index is a good prognostic tool for graft outcomes in deceased donor kidney transplantation with short, cold ischemic time.","abstract":"We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the prognostic value of standard criteria donor/expanded criteria donor (SCD/ECD) designation, with regard to one-yr GFR and graft survival rate, in a region with short, cold ischemic time (CIT), and how this designation compares with the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) and zero-time kidney biopsies.We reviewed 362 cases of deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT). Donor kidneys were classified as SCD or ECD. They were also assessed by the KDRI. Zero-time kidney biopsy was performed in 196 patients, and histologic score was assessed.Median follow-up duration was 46 months. Forty-two cases (11.6%) used ECD kidneys. The mean CIT was only 4.9 Â± 2.7 h. Graft survival rates were not significantly different between ECD and SCD groups. The KDRI showed the best correlation with one-yr estimations of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (R(2) = 0.230, p < 0.001), and higher KDRI was associated with a higher risk of graft failure (hazard ratio 2.63, 95% confidence interval 1.01-6.87). However, higher histologic score was not associated with a higher risk of graft failure.KDRI has greater predictive value for short-term outcomes in DDKT with short CIT than the SCD/ECD designation or pathology.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506770","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.772237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.628009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.332676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.319198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0719954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"362","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/362"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Doctor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Science"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
