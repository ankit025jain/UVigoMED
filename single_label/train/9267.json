{"id":9267,"title":"Sustained normalization of neurological disease after intracranial gene therapy in a feline model.","abstract":"Progressive debilitating neurological defects characterize feline G(M1) gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of lysosomal ?-galactosidase. No effective therapy exists for affected children, who often die before age 5 years. An adeno-associated viral vector carrying the therapeutic gene was injected bilaterally into two brain targets (thalamus and deep cerebellar nuclei) of a feline model of G(M1) gangliosidosis. Gene therapy normalized ?-galactosidase activity and storage throughout the brain and spinal cord. The mean survival of 12 treated G(M1) animals was >38 months, compared to 8 months for untreated animals. Seven of the eight treated animals remaining alive demonstrated normalization of disease, with abrogation of many symptoms including gait deficits and postural imbalance. Sustained correction of the G(M1) gangliosidosis disease phenotype after limited intracranial targeting by gene therapy in a large animal model suggests that this approach may be useful for treating the human version of this lysosomal storage disorder.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718858","annotations":[{"name":"Thalamus","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.816307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Viral vector","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.724729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.70516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.409215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Lysosomal storage disease","weight":0.272977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosomal_storage_disease"},{"name":"Felidae","weight":0.228267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"GM1 gangliosidoses","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM1_gangliosidoses"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cerebellar nuclei","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_nuclei"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"GM1","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM1"},{"name":"Gangliosidosis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangliosidosis"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
