{"id":88956,"title":"Distal tibia fractures and medial plating: factors influencing re-operation.","abstract":"We compared types of complications leading to re-operations in open and closed distal tibia fractures treated by locking or nonlocking medial plates.Ninety-three patients from 2002 to 2012 who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and medial plating for distal extra-articular or partial articular tibia fractures were identified. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to determine the incidence of re-operation based on the type of complication that developed. Fisher's exact and chi-square tests were performed to analyze the incidence of complications based on injury and type of plate used.Thirty-three (35.5 %) patients required re-operations: 28.6 % (n = 16) with closed injuries had complications leading to re-operations compared with 45.9 % (n = 17) of patients with open injuries (p = 0.12). Patients with closed injuries were more likely to require re-operation due to hardware pain/prominence (p = 0.03), whereas patients with open injuries were more likely to require re-operation due to nonunion (p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in infection (p = 0.66) or malunion (p = 0.99) between groups. Locking plates showed higher costs but were not associated with decreased risk of re-operation.There was a high re-operation rate associated with distal tibia medial plating, with significant differences in the reason for re-operation between open versus closed groups. Complication rates were not influenced by the use of locking plates. Results of this study suggest that methods be considered to reduce re-operation based on type of fracture, such as early bone grafting or the use of alternate implants for open fractures.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770693","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.748005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.729602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.705421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.607622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.372954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0861693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Lower extremity of tibia","weight":0.016711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_tibia"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
