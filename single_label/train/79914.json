{"id":79914,"title":"Nested PCR detection of malaria directly using blood filter paper samples from epidemiological surveys.","abstract":"Nested PCR is considered a sensitive and specific method for detecting malaria parasites and is especially useful in epidemiological surveys. However, the preparation of DNA templates for PCR is often time-consuming and costly.A simplified PCR method was developed to directly use a small blood filter paper square (2 Ã— 2 mm) as the DNA template after treatment with saponin. This filter paper-based nested PCR method (FP-PCR) was compared to microscopy and standard nested PCR with DNA extracted by using a Qiagen DNA mini kit from filter paper blood spots of 204 febrile cases. The FP-PCR technique was further applied to evaluate malaria infections in 1,708 participants from cross-sectional epidemiological surveys conducted in Myanmar and Thailand.The FP-PCR method had a detection limit of ~0.2 parasites/?L blood, estimated using cultured Plasmodium falciparum parasites. With 204 field samples, the sensitivity of the FP-PCR method was comparable to that of the standard nested PCR method, which was significantly higher than that of microscopy. Application of the FP-PCR method in large cross-sectional studies conducted in Myanmar and Thailand detected 1.9% (12/638) and 6.2% (66/1,070) asymptomatic Plasmodium infections, respectively, as compared to the detection rates of 1.3% (8/638) and 0.04% (4/1,070) by microscopy.This FP-PCR method was much more sensitive than microscopy in detecting Plasmodium infections. It drastically increased the detection sensitivity of asymptomatic infections in cross-sectional surveys conducted in Thailand and Myanmar, suggesting that this FP-PCR method has a potential for future applications in malaria epidemiology studies.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884761","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.73296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Burma","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.245162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.241274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Filter paper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_paper"},{"name":"Qiagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiagen"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Water filter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_filter"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"DNA extraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction"},{"name":"Nested","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested"}]}
