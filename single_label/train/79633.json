{"id":79633,"title":"RNA interference for the identification of ectoparasite vaccine candidates.","abstract":"Ectoparasites present a major challenge for disease management globally. With drug resistance increasingly observed in many disease-causing species, the need for novel control measures is pressing. Ever-expanding genomic resources from 'next generation' sequencing are now available for a number of arthropod ectoparasites, necessitating an effective means of screening these data for novel candidates for vaccine antigens or targets for chemotherapeutics. Such in vitro screening methods must be developed if we are to make discoveries in a timely and cost-effective manner. This review will discuss the potential that RNA interference (RNAi) has demonstrated thus far in the context of arthropod ectoparasites and the potential roles for this technology in the development of novel methods for parasite control.
