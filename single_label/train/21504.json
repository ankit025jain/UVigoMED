{"id":21504,"title":"Serodiagnosis as adjunct assay for pertussis infection in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.","abstract":"Pertussis remains an important public health problem in many countries despite extensive immunization. Cultures and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays are the recommended pertussis diagnostic tests, but they lack sensitivity at the later stage of the disease. This study introduces the IgG anti-pertussis toxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PT ELISA) in our routine diagnosis to improve disease burden estimation. Serum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 503) were collected at the same time from patients presenting with cough illness suspected of being pertussis and tested by the PT ELISA and culture and/or RT-PCR, respectively. Patients were separated into three age groups: group 1, <1 year (n = 260; mean age, 3 months), group 2, 1 to 6 years (n = 81; mean age, 3 years), and group 3, ?7 years (n = 162; mean age, 26 years). The times (means) from cough onset to specimen collection were 16, 24, and 26 days, respectively. In group 1, 83 (82.2%) of 101 positive cases were positive for pertussis by culture/RT-PCR, while 40 (39.6%) tested positive by PT ELISA. In group 2, 6 (19.4%) of 31 positive cases were culture/RT-PCR positive, and 29 (93.6%) were seropositive. In group 3, 13 (13.8%) of 94 positive cases were positive by culture/RT-PCR and 91 (96.8%) were positive by serology. Culture/RT-PCR detected more cases of pertussis in infants (P < 0.0001), whereas the PT ELISA detected more cases in adolescents and adults (P < 0.0001). The timing between cough onset and specimen collection or recent vaccination may have partially affected our results. Serology is a suitable, cost-effective, and complementary pertussis diagnostic tool, especially among older children, adolescents, and adults during the later disease phase.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599531","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Pertussis","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.729189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.583084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.580649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.412253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.389893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.370684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
