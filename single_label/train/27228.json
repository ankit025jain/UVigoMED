{"id":27228,"title":"Multimodality imaging in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","abstract":"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a major advance that has dramatically changed our approach to elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis. This advance has been made possible by innovative device and delivery improvements, coupled with rapid developments in multimodality imaging. Multimodality imaging draws from multiple imaging fields and is central to patient evaluation and treatment. The primary modalities to date include transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and fluoroscopy. Each of these modalities carries a different weight in the various stages of patient selection, procedural guidance, monitoring, and follow-up. Multimodality imaging ensures optimal device selection, delivery, and patient safety, and will continue to advance as the next generation of aortic valve devices further advance cardiovascular care.
