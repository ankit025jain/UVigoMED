{"id":62535,"title":"Clinical outcomes of AIDS-related Burkitt lymphoma: a multi-institution retrospective survey in Japan.","abstract":"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma is treated similarly to non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma, but it is not clear whether highly intensive regimens are beneficial for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Burkitt lymphoma. We conducted a multicenter retrospective survey to clarify the clinical outcomes of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Burkitt lymphoma in the combined antiretroviral therapy era in Japan.We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 33 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Burkitt lymphoma, who were diagnosed at five regional hospitals for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Japan between January 2002 and December 2010.The median follow-up period was 20.0 months (range 0.5-92.7 months). Six (18.2%) patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate, ifosphamide, etoposide and high-dose cytarabine, and 23 (69.7%) patients were treated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine. The overall response rate for all patients was 78.8%, with a complete response rate of 72.7%. The two-year overall survival rate was 68.1%. There was no significant difference in overall survival between chemotherapeutic regimens with rituximab (n = 20) and without rituximab (n = 13) (P = 0.49). The two-year overall survival rate was 66.7% for patients receiving cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide and cytarabine, and was 72.6% for patients receiving cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate and cytarabine (P = 0.72). There was one treatment-related death.Highly intensive chemotherapy would bring a high remission rate and prolonged overall survival for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Burkitt lymphoma.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558129","annotations":[{"name":"Ifosfamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifosfamide"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Burkitt's lymphoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkitt's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.555074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.468739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
