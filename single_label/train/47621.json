{"id":47621,"title":"Metformin in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: safety, efficacy and mechanism.","abstract":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease etiology worldwide. It encompasses a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Although the physiopathology of NAFLD is partly known. Insulin-resistance plays a central role in the development and progression of NAFLD. Several studies have indicated that metformin, as an insulin sensitizer, effectively improves NAFLD and its related metabolic status. Metformin was effective in reducing enzyme levels in the short period, but very limited and controversial information are available on liver histology. Larger randomized controlled trials of sufficient duration using clearly defined histological endpoints are needed to fully assess the efficacy of this drug in modifying the natural history of NAFLD.
