{"id":78425,"title":"[A case report of giant cell tumor of larynx].","abstract":"Giant cell tumor (GCT) is rare and it mainly occurred in male patients. A man of 65 years-old with progressive dyspnea has a 4 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm tumor mass under the right vocal fold originated from right-thyroid cartilage and the parapharyngeal space. The right false vocal was involved in the computed tomography (CT) imaging and laryngoscope. Microscopically, the tumors had an expansile, infiltrative growth and consisted of numerous multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells within a cellular stroma composed of plump and oval mononuclear cells. The patient underwent partial laryngectomy and has been followed up for 6 months without recurrence or metastasis.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669699","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.790549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.735241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.706397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.691256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.611753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Giant-cell tumor of bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-cell_tumor_of_bone"},{"name":"Multinucleate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinucleate"}]}
