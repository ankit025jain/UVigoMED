{"id":91750,"title":"Biomechanics assessment of long term consequences of talocrural joint sprain in conservatively treated males.","abstract":"The aim of the study was an assessment of isometric torque (IT) values under static conditions and relative torque (RT) for the plantar flexion muscles (PFM) and dorsal flexion muscles (DFM) and their mutual relations in males 5 years after talocrural joint sprain. IT measurements in PFM and DFM were performed using Biodex System 3. Group I consisted of 20 males on average 5 years after the sprain of the talocrural joint. Group II comprised 23 males with no history of talocrural joint injuries. The angles of measurement were: -15° of dorsiflexion (DF) and 0°, 15°, 30° and 45° for plantar flexion (PF) of the foot. In group I, the IT and RT obtained from PFM of involved leg were statistically significantly lower for most of the measured values of foot angle as compared to the contralateral joint and the results of the control group. The increase in the PF angle resulted in the decrease in IT values obtained from PFM, in favour of DFM. The IT values for PFM and DFM depend on the angle of foot and are represented by two different curves.
