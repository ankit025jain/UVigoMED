{"id":87592,"title":"ACL injuries and stem cell therapy.","abstract":"Tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are very frequent injuries, particularly in young and active people. Arthroscopic reconstruction using tendon auto- or allograft represents the gold-standard for the management of ACL tears. Interestingly, the ACL has the potential to heal upon intensive non-surgical rehabilitation procedures. Several biological factors influence this healing process as local intraligamentous cytokines and mainly cell repair mechanisms controlled by stem cells or progenitor cells. Understanding the mechanisms of this regeneration process and the cells involved may pave the way for novel, less invasive and biology-based strategies for ACL repair. This review aims to focus on the current knowledge on the mechanisms of ACL healing, the nature and potential of ligament derived stem/progenitor cells as well as on the potential and the limitations of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for treating injured ACL.
