{"id":86464,"title":"Seasonal influenza vaccination uptake in Quebec, Canada, 2 years after the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.","abstract":"A decrease in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was observed after the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009. The goal of our study was to assess seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in 2011-2012, 2 years after the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic mass immunization campaign and to identify the main reasons for having or not having received the vaccine.A telephone survey using random-digit dialing methodology was conducted. Case-weights were assigned to adjust for disproportionate sampling and for nonresponse bias. Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables.Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was 57% among adults aged ?60 years, 35% among adults with chronic medical conditions, and 44% among health care workers. The main reasons given for having been vaccinated were to be protected from influenza and a high perceived susceptibility to influenza, whereas low perceived susceptibility to influenza and low perceived severity of influenza were the main reasons for not having been vaccinated.An increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was observed 2 years after the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. However, vaccine coverage is still below the target level of 80%. More efforts are needed to develop effective strategies to increase seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773805","annotations":[{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.789504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.726557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.642656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Quebec","weight":0.636812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.567795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.455229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Flu season","weight":0.302918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.167041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Non-communicable disease","weight":0.150192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-communicable_disease"},{"name":"2009 flu pandemic","weight":0.134985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
