{"id":89784,"title":"CT of preoperative and postoperative acetabular fractures revisited.","abstract":"We compared preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) versus radiographic imaging in the evaluation of acetabular fractures (AFs).Fifty-four patients who underwent imaging for AFs were retrospectively evaluated. Postoperative reduction quality was assessed on radiographs and CT scan by 2 observers. Rate of reintervention was noted. Radiation exposure from CT was calculated.After reduction, 24 patients had significant findings on postoperative CT. Five patients required reintervention, all of whom had significant postoperative CT findings and complex fractures. Notably, only 1 of the 5 patients had an indication for reintervention based on radiographs alone.The average dose for preoperative/postoperative CT study was 11.5/12.3 mSv, respectively, with a cumulative average dose of 23.8 mSv.Although reoperation rate is low after fixation of AFs, CT is required to identify those requiring reintervention. However, postoperative CT should be used judicially, only in patients presenting with complex acetabular fractures.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681866","annotations":[{"name":"Radioactive contamination","weight":0.878517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.86265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Sievert","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.596476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.570234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.50703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.412872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Judiciary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"}]}
