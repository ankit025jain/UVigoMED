{"id":44174,"title":"Efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt with adjunctive embolotherapy with cyanoacrylate for esophageal variceal bleeding.","abstract":"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with adjunctive embolotherapy has recently been reported to be effective in the prevention of variceal hemorrhage of cirrhotic patients. However, further investigation of its long-term efficacy is still needed.To examine the rebleeding, survival, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) after treatment with TIPS alone and TIPS with adjunctive embolotherapy using cyanoacrylate for esophageal variceal bleeding.Patients with refractory to endoscopic therapy for esophageal variceal bleeding were enrolled. TIPS was performed in 101 patients with adjunctive embolotherapy (n = 53) or alone (n = 48) between January 2006 and December 2011. Chart reviews were performed to determine rebleeding, survival rates, and the incidence of HE.Recurrent hemorrhage occurred in 12 (11.9 %) patients during the mean follow-up periods of 35.8 months. Rebleeding was observed in 9/48 (18.8 %) patients in TIPS alone group and 3/53 (5.7 %) patients in TIPS with adjunctive embolotherapy group (p = 0.042). Death occurred in 30 patients during follow-up (TIPS alone: n = 16, TIPS with adjunctive embolotherapy: n = 14, p = 0.447). Twenty-six episodes of HE occurred in 18 patients in TIPS alone group and 16 episodes occurred in 10 patients in TIPS with embolotherapy group. The probability of HE was significantly higher in TIPS alone group than in TIPS with embolotherapy group (p = 0.019).TIPS with adjunctive embolotherapy with cyanoacrylate is relatively safe and effective, with a lower rebleeding and HE incidence in comparison of TIPS alone.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748182","annotations":[{"name":"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt","weight":0.916951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjugular_intrahepatic_portosystemic_shunt"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Hepatic encephalopathy","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.616111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.467884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.364682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Cyanoacrylate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"948","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/948"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
