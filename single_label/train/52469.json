{"id":52469,"title":"Deregulation of microRNA expression in thyroid tumors.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' non-coding regions of target mRNAs, resulting in their cleavage or blocking their translation. miRNAs may have an impact on cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and their deregulation can be inclined to diseases and cancers, including thyroid tumors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing findings of deregulated miRNAs in different types of thyroid tumors and to exhibit their potential target genes, especially to demonstrate those involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. In addition, new findings of circulating miRNA expression profiles, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in thyroid tumors, and the correlation of somatic mutations with deregulated miRNA expression in thyroid tumors were all included in this review.
