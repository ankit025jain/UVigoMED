{"id":12362,"title":"Abdominal hypertension and decompression: the effect on peritoneal metabolism in an experimental porcine study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the abdominal metabolic response and circulatory changes after decompression of intra-abdominal hypertension in a porcine model.This was an experimental study with controls. Three-month-old domestic pigs of both sexes were anesthetized and ventilated. Nine animals had a pneumoperitoneum-induced IAH of 30Â mmHg for 6 hours. Twelve animals had the same IAH for 4 hours followed by decompression, and were monitored for another 2 hours. Hemodynamics, including laser Doppler-measured mucosal blood flow, urine output, and arterial blood samples were analyzed every hour along with glucose, glycerol, lactate and pyruvate concentrations, and lactate-pyruvate (l/p) ratio, measured by microdialysis.Laser Doppler-measured mucosal blood flow and urine output decreased with the induction of IAH and showed a statistically significant resolution after decompression. Both groups developed distinct metabolic changes intraperitoneally on induction of IAH, including an increased l/p ratio, as signs of organ hypoperfusion. In the decompression group the intraperitoneal l/p ratio normalized during the second decompression hour, indicating partially restored perfusion.Decompression after 4 hours of IAH results in an improved intestinal blood flow and a normalized intraperitoneal l/p ratio.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530179","annotations":[{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.827921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pyruvic acid","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.708486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.612962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.545042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.441692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.435845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.381019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.339403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.155741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Microdialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdialysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"}]}
