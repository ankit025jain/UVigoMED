{"id":73346,"title":"Liposomes, modified with PTD(HIV-1) peptide, containing epirubicin and celecoxib, to target vasculogenic mimicry channels in invasive breast cancer.","abstract":"Refractoriness of invasive breast cancer is closely related with the vasculogenic mimicry (VM) channels, which exhibit highly drug resistance to conventional chemotherapies. In the present study, the nanostructured targeting epirubicin plus celecoxib liposomes were developed by modifying a human immunodeficiency virus peptide lipid-derivative conjugate (DSPE-PEG2000-PTDHIV-1) for elimination of invasive breast cancer cells along with their VM channels. The studies were undertaken on invasive human breast cancer MDA-MB-435S cells and MDA-MB-435S xenografts in nude mice. The constructed targeting epirubicin plus celecoxib liposomes were approximately 100 nm in size. In vitro results showed that the targeting liposomes exhibited strong transport ability across cell and nuclei membranes of invasive breast cancer, were able to penetrate and destruct the invasive breast cancer spheroids, initiated apoptosis via activating apoptotic enzymes (caspase 8, 3), and destroyed the VM channels via down-regulating the protein indicators (MMP-9, VE-Cad, FAK, EphA2 and HIF-1?) in invasive breast cancer cells. In vivo results demonstrated that the targeting liposomes displayed a prolonged circulation time in blood system, accumulated more in tumor location, were able to eliminate the VM channels and angiogenesis in tumor tissues, and resulted in a robust overall anticancer efficacy in invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-435S xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, the nanostructured targeting epirubicin plus celecoxib liposomes could eliminate invasive breast cancer along with the VM channels, hence providing a promising strategy for treatment of invasive breast cancer.
