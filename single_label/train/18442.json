{"id":18442,"title":"Recent advances in technologies for developing drugs against Chlamydia pneumoniae.","abstract":"The unique morphological characteristics, capacity of manipulating host cell function and association with chronic inflammatory diseases represent the features of Chlamydia pneumoniae that have fascinated scientists and medical professionals for several decades.In this paper, the authors review the current status of attempts to discover and develop drugs against C. pneumoniae, including: the discovery of non-conventional antichlamydial agents, targeting chlamydial type 3 secretion system, approved drug repositioning and combination therapies. In addition, the authors discuss the recent advances in C. pneumoniae-related genomics and proteomics research and genetic manipulation technologies.Based on current knowledge, it is important for researchers to continue to focus on phenotypic assays on persistent infections. There should also be a careful evaluation of the physicochemical properties of the lead candidates and attempts toward more narrow-spectrum antibacterial agents. All these elements are important for successful lead generation. The recent advances in understanding C. pneumoniae biology and breakthroughs in genetic transformation are likely to improve the potential for identifying and validating therapeutic targets within both the bacterium and its host cells.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792993","annotations":[{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chlamydia infection","weight":0.586183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_infection"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.542155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Scientist","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.335747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Chlamydophila pneumoniae","weight":0.141376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Type three secretion system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_three_secretion_system"}]}
