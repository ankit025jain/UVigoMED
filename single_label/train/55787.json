{"id":55787,"title":"Clinicopathological features of inflammatory lesions of the lateral canthal subconjunctival area.","abstract":"To investigate the clinical and histopathological features of inflammatory lesions of the lateral canthal subconjunctival area.This is a retrospective case series of 12 patients with inflammatory subconjunctival masses in the lateral canthal area. All patients included in this study were treated at Seoul National University Hospital or Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between 2006 and 2012. Clinical data were obtained from the medical records. Histopathologic findings were thoroughly reviewed.There was a woman predominance in the study group (10:2), and the median age at presentation was 39 years (range 33-70). Common symptoms included conjunctival injection, sticky discharge, and pain or discomfort. Histopathologically, all lesions originated from ductules of the lacrimal gland. Two cases showed cysts containing clear fluid with mild inflammation. One case showed lacrimal ductulitis without cyst formation. Nine cases showed lacrimal ductal cysts with varying periductal inflammation, and the contents were pinkish, amorphous materials in 7 cases. Embedded cilia were found in 8 cases.Inflammatory lesions of the lateral canthal subconjunctival area all originated from lacrimal gland ductules, showing a variable histopathologic spectrum of inflammation and cyst formation. Cilia impaction was a very frequently observed finding.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Eye
