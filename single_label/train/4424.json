{"id":4424,"title":"[Model for sanitary-helminthological supervision and search for the measures for disinfestation of soil and water in the beef tapeworm infection foci in conditions of Kabardino-Balkaria].","abstract":"The soil and water runoff from the livestock facilities are potentially dangerous for the infection of animal with eggs Taeniarhynchus saginatus. The complex antihelminthic measures and the basis of sanitary and parasitological model of prevention of parasitic diseases of humans and animals in Kabardino-Balkaria allowed within 3-4 years to diminish the contamination of soil with cestode eggs in 4-4.8 times. EGAT drug concentration of 50% and exposure in the range 1-20 days in a clean slurry causes the death to 47% of the eggs T. saginatus, in soil--up to 52% sewage sludge--45% in sewage--49%, that indicates its lack of ovicidal efficacy against cestode eggs.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306696","annotations":[{"name":"Soil","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sludge","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sludge"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cestoda","weight":0.632806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda"},{"name":"Beef","weight":0.631563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Sewage","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Surface runoff","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.436599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pest control","weight":0.404301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.337525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Anthelmintic","weight":0.293579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthelmintic"},{"name":"Slurry","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.156702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"List of human parasitic diseases","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_parasitic_diseases"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Tapeworm infection","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapeworm_infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Taenia saginata","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_saginata"}]}
