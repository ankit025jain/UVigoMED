{"id":90492,"title":"Nylon foil (supramid) orbital implants in pediatric orbital fracture repair.","abstract":"To present the authors experience with the nylon foil (Supramid) implant as a safe and effective method to repair pediatric orbital wall fractures.A retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients (?18 years) that underwent orbital wall fracture repair with an unsecured 0.4-mm Supramid implant between 2007 and 2010. Outcome variables were diplopia and surgical complications. This study was carried out with IRB approval.A total of 59 orbits in 57 patients underwent orbital fracture repair using solely the 0.4-mm Supramid implant that were included in this retrospective chart review with the average age being 12 years. Trauma related to daily activities (42.1%) was the most frequent cause of orbital fractures. Eight patients (14.0%) had associated ocular/orbital injuries. Thirty-one patients (54.8%) were symptomatic at presentation with the most common presenting symptom being diplopia (n = 19, 33.3%). The most common fracture pattern sustained was combined orbital floor and medial wall fractures, which occurred in 21 patients (36.8%). Of the 3 patients (5.3%) that required immediate intervention due to extraocular muscle entrapment resulting in vasovagal responses, all returned to full and normal extraocular motility. There were 2 postoperative complications without any permanent sequelae; no patient developed postoperative enophthalmos recognizable by both physician and parents, and diplopia improved in all the 6 patients who suffered from immediate postoperative diplopia (10.7%).The nylon foil implant is a safe and effective method to repair pediatric orbital wall fractures given the low complication rate.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608327","annotations":[{"name":"Extraocular muscles","weight":0.917494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles"},{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.660869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.565782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.487732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.320808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Facial trauma","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_trauma"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Chief complaint","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_complaint"},{"name":"Foil (fencing)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)"},{"name":"Enophthalmos","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enophthalmos"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nylon","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Vasovagal response","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasovagal_response"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Unsecured debt","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt"},{"name":"International Rugby Board","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rugby_Board"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Nerve compression syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_compression_syndrome"}]}
