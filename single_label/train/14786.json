{"id":14786,"title":"Chikungunya vaccine candidate is highly attenuated and protects nonhuman primates against telemetrically monitored disease following a single dose.","abstract":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes major epidemics of rash, fever, and debilitating arthritis. Currently, there are no vaccines or antivirals available for prevention or treatment. We therefore generated 2 live-attenuated vaccine candidates based on the insertion of a picornavirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence into the genome of CHIKV. Vaccination of cynomolgus macaques with a single dose of either vaccine produced no signs of disease but was highly immunogenic. After challenge with a subcutaneous inoculation of wild-type CHIKV, both vaccine candidates prevented the development of detectable viremia. Protected animals also exhibited no significant changes in core body temperature or cardiovascular rhythm, whereas sham-vaccinated animals showed hyperthermia, followed by sustained hypothermia, as well as significant changes in heart rate. These CHIKV/IRES vaccine candidates appear to be safe and efficacious, supporting their strong potential as human vaccines to protect against CHIKV infection and reduce transmission and further spread.
