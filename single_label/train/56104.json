{"id":56104,"title":"Corneal biomechanical effects: small-incision lenticule extraction versus femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis.","abstract":"To compare the biomechanical properties of the cornea after small-incision lenticule extraction (lenticule extraction group) with those after femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (femtosecond LASIK group).Tianjin Eye Hospital & Eye Institute, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.Prospective comparative case series.Corneal hysteresis (CH), the corneal resistance factor (CRF), and 37 other biomechanical waveform parameters were quantitatively assessed with the Ocular Response Analyzer preoperatively and 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.Each group comprised 40 eyes. The decrease in CH and the CRF was statistically significant 1 week postoperatively compared with preoperatively in both groups (P<.0001). However, the CH and CRF values in the lenticule extraction group were significantly higher than those in the femtosecond LASIK group 3 months and 6 months postoperatively (P<.032). The residual stromal thickness index versus the CRF and CH and the planned lenticule thickness versus the change in central corneal thickness were statistically significant in the lenticule extraction group (r = 0.388 to 0.950, P<.018); no significant correlation was found in the femtosecond LASIK group. In the waveform analysis of the lenticule extraction group, 28 of the 37 biomechanical waveform parameters differed significantly between preoperative values and postoperative values (P<.035).Both small-incision lenticule extraction and femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK can cause biomechanical changes in the cornea. However, changes in the cornea's viscoelastic properties were less after lenticule extraction than after LASIK.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method
