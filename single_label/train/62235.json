{"id":62235,"title":"Associations between tumor necrosis factor alpha gene polymorphism and sarcoidosis: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Published studies regarding the association between tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) gene polymorphism and sarcoidosis risk are inconsistent. In order to clarify this association, we performed a meta-analysis of case-control studies with available data. PubMed, EMBASE and BIOSIS Previews were comprehensively searched to identify relevant studies. Twelve case-control studies in 11 articles involving 3,218 participants were included in the meta-analysis to assess the association between TNF-? gene polymorphism and susceptibility to sarcoidosis. We estimated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to explore the potential association. Our meta-analysis results suggested that TNF-?-308G/A AA/AG genotype increased sarcoidosis risk, in Asian and Caucasian ethnicity, and in sarcoidosis with LÃ¶fgren syndrome. No association was found between TNF-?-238G/A, TNF-?-857C/T polymorphism and sarcoidosis risk. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that AG/GG genotype of TNF-?-308G/A are associated with increased sarcoidosis risk.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604725","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.842449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.748472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.616912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.604483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.582419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.459945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.391347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.286805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.272756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.150978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"BIOSIS Previews","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOSIS_Previews"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"857","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/857"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Diamond Comic Distributors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Comic_Distributors"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
