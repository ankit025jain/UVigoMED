{"id":84650,"title":"Rgn gene is required for gut cell homeostasis after ingestion of sodium dodecyl sulfate in Drosophila.","abstract":"Resistance and resilience constitute the two complementary aspects of epithelial host defenses in Drosophila. Epithelial cell homeostasis is necessary for the recovery of damages caused by stress or infections. However, the genes responsible for gut epithelial homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that rgn(G4035) mutant flies have higher mortality than wild-type flies after ingestion of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Excessive melanization and increased necrotic cells in the gut contribute to the reduced survival of rgn(G4035) mutant flies following SDS ingestion. rgn mutant flies have a defect in the replenishment of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) following gut damage. The antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression is affected in rgn(G4035) mutant fly guts. Together, our study provides evidence that rgn gene is essential for gut cell homeostasis following damage in Drosophila.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064488","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antimicrobial peptides","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_peptides"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.813404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Melanin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.763288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.666133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.652992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.565145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.511784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Sodium dodecyl sulfate","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.46307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.396369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.375202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Adenosine monophosphate","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Ultimate tensile strength","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}]}
