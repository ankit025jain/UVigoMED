{"id":15148,"title":"[Development and testing of an enzyme immunoassay-based monoclonal test system for the detection of the Yersinia pestis V antigen].","abstract":"An enzyme immunoassay-based test system for Y. pestis V antigen detection was developed. The specificity and sensitivity of this system met the requirements for medical immunobiological preparations for the identification of causative agents of highly fatal diseases. The sensitivity of the test system was assessed, and its high specificity was also demonstrated: the test system did not detect bacterial cells of closely related (four Y. pseudotuberculosis strains) and heterologous microorganism strains. The test system developed was able to detect the V antigen at concentrations as low as 2.0 ng/mL in cells of nine experimental Y. pestis cultures. The obtained preparation can be recommended for use in laboratory diagnostics of plaque.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272741","annotations":[{"name":"Yersinia pestis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.341827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.147267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pseudotuberculosis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Trypsin inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin_inhibitor"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
