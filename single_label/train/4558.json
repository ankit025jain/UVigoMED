{"id":4558,"title":"[Surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax in a 102-year-old woman].","abstract":"We report a 102-year-old female who underwent surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax. As leakage did not disappear for over one month, she was referred to our hospital for surgery. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed. Multiple small bullae were observed, and one of which was the cause of leakage. She was successfully treated by pleural covering with polyglycolic acid sheet and fibrin glue. Patients of such advanced age can be good candidates for surgical treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax, when they have no severe underlying diseases.
