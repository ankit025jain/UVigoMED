{"id":90050,"title":"Lipofilling for functional reconstruction of the sole of the foot.","abstract":"New advances in regenerative surgery may increase the potential for rehabilitation in the injured foot.A clinical prospective observational study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of lipofilling to improve the functional recovery of the injured foot.Four patients with anatomical-functional impairment following repair of post-traumatic soft tissue loss of the foot were involved in the study. All of the patients complained of pain in the repaired plantar weight bearing area, skin instability, recurrent ulcerations and were walking on crutches. A combined plastic surgery and technical orthopaedic assessment identified the plantar areas requiring anatomical changes for load redistribution. Two selective sequential lipofillings with a 12 weeks' time interval were performed. Manufacturing of custom-made plantar insoles and/or shoes followed each surgical procedure.After the treatment all of the patients progressively recovered both a better plantar load distribution and a local soft tissue stability, referred the remission of chronic pain and discontinued the use of crutches.Lipofilling proved to be an effective and versatile surgical technique for both reconstructive and regenerative purposes. The interaction between the Plastic Surgery staff and the Orthopaedic Technician outlined a successful multidisciplinary approach model for the rehabilitation of the injured foot.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656457","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.727273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.683517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.595056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.418089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.366389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Crutch","weight":0.176157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crutch"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.130637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Shoe","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Sole (foot)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_(foot)"}]}
