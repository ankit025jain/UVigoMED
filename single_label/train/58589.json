{"id":58589,"title":"Immobility reaction at birth in newborn infant.","abstract":"To describe an immobility reaction (IR) that was not previously reported at or immediately after birth in human newborns.We analyzed 31 videos of normal term vaginal deliveries recorded from Time 0 of birth defined as the as the moment that lies between the birth of the thorax and the pelvis of the infant. We searched for perinatal factors associated with newborn's IR.IR at birth was observed in 8 of the 31 newborns. The main features of their behavior were immobilization, frozen face, shallow breathing and bradycardia. One of the 8 newborns had sudden collapse 2h after birth. We found significant relationships between maternal prenatal stress (PS) and IR (p=.037), and a close to significant one between infants' lividness at Time 0 and IR (p=.053). The first breath of the 31 newborns occurred before and was not associated with the first cry (p<.001).The main features of IR at birth are similar to those of the universal most severe response to severe stress or danger. The relationship with PS suggests that children who had IR at birth might be at risk for similar disorders as those associated with PS. Sudden neonatal collapse of one of the IR newborns needs further research to determine if they are at risk for sudden infant death syndrome.This first report of an IR reaction at birth in human infants could open up new paths for improving early neonatal care. Further research is needed for maternal PS, stress hormones, umbilical cord blood pH measurements in IR newborns. The challenge of education and support for parents of IR newborns is outlined.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922114","annotations":[{"name":"Sudden infant death syndrome","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome"},{"name":"Bradycardia","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.813725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.759425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.725634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.465761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.217554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Infant mortality","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.0724552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Stress hormone","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_hormone"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Universe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe"},{"name":"Suspended animation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_animation"}]}
