{"id":42221,"title":"Soluble CD40 ligand-activated B cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection as antigen presenting cells to induce hepatitis B virus specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.","abstract":"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the result of an inadequate antiviral immune response to the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the soluble CD40 ligand-activated B (CD40-B) cells could present antigen and induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in patients with chronic HBV infection. We observed that after activated by sCD40L, the expression of CD80, CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II molecules on the CD40-B cells was significantly increased. Cytometry and fluorescence microscopy showed that more than 41.34% CD40-B cells were loaded by the HBcAg peptide. Furthermore, after been activated and HBcAg18-27 antigen peptide pulsed, B cells obtained from patients with chronic HBV infection could induce HBcAg18-27 specific CTLs in vitro. Taken together, our results show that B cells from patients with chronic HBV infection can be activated by sCD40L and may function as antigen presenting cells and induce HBV-specific CTLs.
