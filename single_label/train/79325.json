{"id":79325,"title":"Patient-centred care: a review for rehabilitative audiologists.","abstract":"This discussion paper aims to synthesise the literature on patient-centred care from a range of health professions and to relate this to the field of rehabilitative audiology. Through review of the literature, this paper addresses five questions: What is patient-centred care? How is patient-centred care measured? What are the outcomes of patient-centred care? What are the factors contributing to patient-centred care? What are the implications for audiological rehabilitation?Literature review and synthesis.Publications were identified by structured searches in PubMed, Cinahl, Web of Knowledge, and PsychInfo, and by inspecting the reference lists of relevant articles.Few publications from within the audiology profession address this topic and consequently a review and synthesis of literature from other areas of health were used to answer the proposed questions.This paper concludes that patient-centred care is in line with the aims and scope of practice for audiological rehabilitation. However, there is emerging evidence that we still need to inform the conceptualisation of patient-centred audiological rehabilitation. A definition of patient-centred audiological rehabilitation is needed to facilitate studies into the nature and outcomes of it in audiological rehabilitation practice.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447236","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.462713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.323912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0587327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0560588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"PsycINFO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PsycINFO"},{"name":"ISI Web of Knowledge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISI_Web_of_Knowledge"},{"name":"CINAHL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINAHL"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Telescopic sight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopic_sight"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Green paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_paper"},{"name":"Scope of practice","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_of_practice"}]}
