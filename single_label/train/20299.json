{"id":20299,"title":"Mucormycosis outbreak associated with hospital linens.","abstract":"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection with a high fatality rate. We investigated an outbreak of mucormycosis in a pediatric hospital to determine routes of pathogen transmission from the environment and prevent additional infections.A case was defined as a hospital-onset illness consistent with mucormycosis, confirmed by culture or histopathology. Case-patient medical records were reviewed for clinical course and exposure to items and locations within the hospital. Environmental samples were collected from air and surfaces. Fungal isolates collected from case-patients and the environmental samples were identified using DNA sequencing.Five case-patients had hospital-associated cutaneous mucormycosis over an 11-month period; all subsequently died. Three case-patients had conditions known to be associated with susceptibility to mucormycosis, while 2 had cardiac conditions with persistent acidosis. The cases occurred on several different wards throughout the hospital, and hospital linens were the only exposure identified as common to the case-patients. Rhizopus species were recovered from 26 (42%) of 62 environmental samples from clean linens and associated areas and from 1 (4%) of 25 samples from nonlinen-related items. Case-patients were infected with Rhizopus delemar, which was also isolated from cultures of clean linens and clean linen delivery bins from the off-site laundry facility.Hospital linens were identified as a vehicle that carried R. delemar into contact with susceptible patients. Fungal species identification using DNA-based methods is useful for corroborating epidemiologic links in hospital outbreak investigations. Hospital linens should be laundered, packaged, shipped and stored in a manner that minimizes exposure to environmental contaminants.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667485","annotations":[{"name":"DNA","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.530818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.504062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.481224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.326509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.233181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.214973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.14551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Linen","weight":0.112803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Rhizopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizopus"},{"name":"Mucormycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucormycosis"},{"name":"Laundry","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry"},{"name":"Money laundering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
