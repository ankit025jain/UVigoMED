{"id":67828,"title":"Monti's principle in the treatment of congenital uterovesical fistula.","abstract":"Congenital uterovesical fistula is rare and generally associated with genital tract abnormalities derived from mullerian ducts or urogenital sinus. Management is usually challenging, and it involves vaginal reconstruction. A 15-year-old female patient presented with a 2-year history of cyclical hematuria. Investigation revealed a bicornuate uterus and complete vaginal agenesis associated with congenital uterovesical fistula. The fistula was repaired, and a neovagina was created using Monti's technique. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with normal voiding and initiation of regular menstruation through the neovagina. We discuss the options of vaginal reconstruction and stress the advantages of the technique used in this case.
