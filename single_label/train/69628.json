{"id":69628,"title":"[Cardura monotherapy versus combination therapy of cardura and tolterodine L-tartrate tablets for II° ? benign prostatic hyperplasia with overactive bladder].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of the monotherapy of Cardura and the combination therapy of Cardura and Tolterodine L-Tartrate Tablets for II° ? benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) with overactive bladder (OAB).This study included 87 cases of BPH with OAB, with a disease course > or = 3 months, daily urination > or = 8 times, nocturnal urination > or = 2 times, urine volume < 200 ml per time, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) > or = 8, OAB symptom score (OABS) > or = 3, quality of life score (QOL) > or = 3, post-void residual (PVR) < or = 100 ml, maximum urinary flow (Qmax) > or = 5 ml/s, prostate weight 25-50 g, and PSA < 4 microg/L. We randomized the patients to a monotherapy group (n = 44) and combination group (n = 43), the former treated with Cardura 4 mg qd, and the latter with Cardura 4 mg + Tolterodine L-Tartrate Tablets 4 mg qd, both for 8 weeks. Then we recorded the IPSS, OABS, Qmax, PVR, PSA, and adverse events.The baseline parameters showed no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). In comparison with the baseline, both the monotherapy group and the combination therapy group showed significant decreased in the IPSS (16.50 +/- 4.27 vs 13.68 +/- 3.69 and 15.51 +/- 3.80 vs 11.49 +/- 2.75), urine storage symptom score (10.48 +/- 2.75 vs 7.98 +/- 2.34 and 9.47 +/- 2.31 vs 5.74 +/- 1.66), OABS (8.55 +/- 2.69 vs 6.32 +/- 1.97 and 8.21 +/- 2.55 vs 4.44 +/- 1.62), urgent micturition score (4.25 +/- 1.06 vs 3.23 +/- 0.99 and 4.07 +/- 0.83 vs 2.26 +/- 1.05), QOL (5.36 +/- 0.72 vs 3.43 +/- 0.66 and 5.07 +/- 0.86 vs 2.37 +/- 0.76) and PVR ([44.55 +/- 22.39] vs [38.30 +/- 20.20] ml and [36.19 +/- 21.21] vs [24.98 +/- 17.60] ml) (P < 0.01). All the six parameters were significantly more improved in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group (P < 0.01), but there were no remarkable differences between the groups in Qmax and voiding symptom score (P > 0.05). Neither group exhibited significant changes in the PSA level and prostate weight after treatment as compared with the baseline (P > 0.05). No acute urinary retention and other severe adverse reactions were observed during the medication.Both Cardura monotherapy and the combination therapy of Cardura + Tolterodine L-Tartrate Tablets can improve II ? BPH with OAB, and the latter has an even better efficacy than the former.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432622","annotations":[{"name":"Tolterodine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolterodine"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.818875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.771015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Doxazosin","weight":0.671355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxazosin"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.616861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
