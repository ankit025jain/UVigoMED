{"id":77023,"title":"?-lactoglobulin as a vector for ?-carotene food fortification.","abstract":"Food fortification is a strategy to overcome vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of the bovine milk protein ?-lactoglobulin (?-Lg), a potential retinoid carrier, in vitamin A absorption. In vivo experiments were conducted by force-feeding mice with retinol or ?-carotene associated with either ?-Lg or oil-in-water emulsion, with subsequent determination of both vitamin A intestinal mucosa and plasma contents. Caco-2 cells were then used to investigate the mechanisms of vitamin A uptake when delivered by either ?-Lg or mixed micelles. We showed that ?-Lg was as efficient as emulsion to promote ?-carotene, but not retinol, absorption in mice. Similar results were obtained in vitro. Interestingly, an inhibitor of the Scavenger Receptor Class B Type I significantly decreased the uptake of micellar ?-carotene but not that of ?-carotene bound to ?-Lg. Overall, we showed that ?-Lg would be a good vector for ?-carotene food fortification.
