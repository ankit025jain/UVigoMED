{"id":65678,"title":"Male pelvic MR angiography.","abstract":"MR angiography is a powerful tool in evaluating anatomy and pathology when applied to the male pelvis. MR angiography produces high-quality images of the arterial system approaching the resolution of CT angiography, without ionizing radiation. Additional advantages include the ability to obtain angiographic images in the absence of contrast material with non-contrast-enhanced MR angiographic techniques. Blood pool contrast agents, such as gadofosveset, have significantly improved the quality of venous system imaging. Steady state imaging with blood pool contrast agents allows for acquisition of superior-quality high-resolution images and other time-intensive techniques.
