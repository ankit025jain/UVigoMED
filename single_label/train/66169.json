{"id":66169,"title":"[Anti-herpetic effect of photodynamic action in an in vitro experiment].","abstract":"Evaluation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vitro antiviral effect directly on the herpes simplex virus (HSV) as well as on virus infected cells.HSV infected Vero cell culture; HSV-1 (VR-3 strain) and HSV-2 (MS strain) were used. Fotoditazin preparation (chlorin E6 derivative) was used as a photosensitizer. AFS physiotherapy apparatus was used for laser irradiation. Experiment variants: study of direct and mediated photodynamic effect on virus-containing fluid (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and on non-infected cell culture; evaluation of anti-herpetic effect of PDT and study of the effect on the newly produced HSV-1 progeny were carried out within the developed experiment scheme.A scheme of experiment conduction for study of mediated photodynamic effect of HSV was developed. A significant reduction of virus titers for more than 2 orders of magnitude (100-1000 times) was detected. Optimal concentration of photosensitizer and laser irradiation dose that results in reduction of HSV-1 titers by 1000 and more times (1.5 - 2.5 orders of magnitude) and reduction of HSV-2 titers by 10 and more times (1.5 order of magnitude) were determined.The data obtained will help selection of adequate scheme of PDT conduction for patients with recurrent herpes virus infection including patients with recurrent miscarriage.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738294","annotations":[{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.825112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.741588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.524765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.492486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.328042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.276701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.270177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Vero cell","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vero_cell"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.13286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Habitual abortion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_abortion"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Order of magnitude","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
