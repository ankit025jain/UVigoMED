{"id":63978,"title":"[Eosinophllic meningitis, a very rare entity in Europe].","abstract":"Eosinophilic meningitis is a rare entity, which is a complication of an underlying disease. Its diagnosis and treatment is always a challenge for the hospital practitioner. The aim of this case report and review is to identify the most important aetiologies, and show the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of Eosinophilic meningitis. The most frequent causes of Eosinophilic meningitis are parasitic and fungal infections. In Europe Eosinophilic meningitis is essentially seen in travellers returning from endemic areas for these agents. The treatment is directed against the underlying disease and can differ depending on the aetiology and severity of the clinical manifestations.","date":"2014-01-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24383281","annotations":[{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.626501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.487823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.378954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"}]}
