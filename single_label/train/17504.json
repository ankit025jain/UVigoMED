{"id":17504,"title":"Mycobacterium kanasii flexor tenosynovitis of the finger.","abstract":"We report an extreme case of Mycobacterium kanasii flexor tenosynovitis with flexor tendon rupture in a healthy 65-year-old left-hand dominant Caucasian housewife. This case highlights the diagnostic conundrum of atypical mycobacteria infections due to their insidious presentation, the need for a high index of suspicion to prevent worsening or delaying the diagnosis from inappropriate steroid use and that these infections can occur in otherwise healthy individuals.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875513","annotations":[{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.770498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.635563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Anabolic steroid","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Tenosynovitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenosynovitis"},{"name":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontuberculous_mycobacteria"},{"name":"Finger (gesture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture)"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"Housewife","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housewife"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
