{"id":1800,"title":"Chest modeling and personalized surgical planning for pectus excavatum.","abstract":"Pectus excavatum is among the most common major congenital anomalies of the chest wall whose correction can be performed via minimally invasive Nuss technique that places a pectus bar to elevate the sternum anteriorly. However, the size and bending of the pectus bar are manually modeled intraoperatively by trial-and-error. The procedure requires intense pain management in the months following surgery. In response, we are developing a novel distraction device for incremental and personalized PE correction with minimal risk and pain, akin to orthodontic treatment using dental braces. To design the device, we propose in this study a personalized surgical planning framework for PE correction from clinical noncontrast CT. First, we segment the ribs and sternum via kernel graph cuts. Then costal cartilages, which have very low contrast in noncontrast CT, are modeled as 3D anatomical curves using the cosine series representation and estimated using a statistical shape model. The size and shape of the correction device are estimated through model fitting. Finally, the corrected/post-surgical chest is simulated in relation to the estimated shape of correction device. The root mean square mesh distance between the estimated cartilages and ground truth on 30 noncontrast CT scans was 1.28 +/- 0.81 mm. Our method found that the average deformation of the sterna and cartilages with the simulation of PE correction was 49.71 +/- 10.11 mm.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and
