{"id":31151,"title":"Combination varenicline and bupropion SR for tobacco-dependence treatment in cigarette smokers: a randomized trial.","abstract":"Combining pharmacotherapies for tobacco-dependence treatment may increase smoking abstinence.To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release (SR; combination therapy) compared with varenicline (monotherapy) in cigarette smokers.Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites. Five hundred six adult (?18 years) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 (62%) completed the study.Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo.Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12, defined as prolonged (no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence (no smoking past 7 days) abstinence. Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52. Outcomes were biochemically confirmed.At 12 weeks, 53.0% of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2% achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2% and 48.6% in varenicline monotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.12; P?=?.03 and OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.95-1.93; P?=?.09, respectively). At 26 weeks, 36.6% of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2% achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6% and 31.9% in varenicline monotherapy (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.04-2.22; P?=?.03 and OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.91-1.91; P?=?.14, respectively). At 52 weeks, 30.9% of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6% achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5% and 29.2% in varenicline monotherapy (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.93-2.07; P?=?.11 and OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.96-2.05; P?=?.08, respectively). Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety (7.2% vs 3.1%; P?=?.04) and depressive symptoms (3.6% vs 0.8%; P?=?.03).Among cigarette smokers, combined use of varenicline and bupropion, compared with varenicline alone, increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks. Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks. Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399554","annotations":[{"name":"Bupropion","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion"},{"name":"Varenicline","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varenicline"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.625804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.376921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.334167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Midwestern United States","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Smoking ban","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_ban"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"}]}
