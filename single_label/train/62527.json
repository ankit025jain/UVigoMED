{"id":62527,"title":"New treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","abstract":"Chemoimmunotherapy is the gold standard of therapy for patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), resulting in high and durable complete response rates. However, all patients eventually relapse and CLL remains incurable. Newer and more rationally developed compounds are needed to improve CLL therapy, particularly in cases of refractory disease.Following a literature search on PubMed using 'chronic', 'lymphocytic', 'treatment' and 'therapy' as keywords, results obtained with novel agents were critically analyzed. Abstracts presented during 2013 at ASH, EHA, ICML, IWCLL and ASCO meetings were also included in the search.New monoclonal antibodies, lenalidomide, B-cell receptor-signal transduction inhibitors and pro-apoptotic molecules have shown efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Hopefully, the combined use of these molecules in risk-adapted treatment strategies will improve the outcome of patients with CLL and pave the way for their long-term control.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559127","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.739777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.690233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.432323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.418165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0372292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Keywords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords"},{"name":"Action on Smoking and Health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_on_Smoking_and_Health"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"American Society of Clinical Oncology","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology"},{"name":"International Conference on Machine Learning","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Machine_Learning"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
