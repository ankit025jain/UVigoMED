{"id":81534,"title":"[Endo-perio lesions prevalence and awareness of dentists about diagnostics and treatment].","abstract":"Two hundreds and ninety eight patients were included in the study. Endo-perio lesions were revealed in 53 (17.78%) patients. Anonymous questionnaires were filled by 183 dentists of different specialties. Most of the dentists try to treat such lesions themselves while for successful treatment interdisciplinary approach is required. Results of anonymous questioning show that most of the dentists haven't enough information not only about endo-perio lesions but also about periodontal therapy and underestimate the value of periodontal therapy for this group of patients.
