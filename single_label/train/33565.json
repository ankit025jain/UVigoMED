{"id":33565,"title":"Genetic variations in the GLUT3 gene associated with myelomeningocele.","abstract":"Our objectives were to examine the extent of described sequence variation in the glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) gene in children with myelomeningocele (MM), identify novel variations in the GLUT3 gene in these children, and determine whether these variations may confer a risk of MM.We sequenced the 10 exons of GLUT3, including exon-intron boundaries, on 96 children with MM. Sequencing was performed with Sanger methods and results analyzed with deoxyribonucleic acid analysis software. Frequencies of known single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, and those differing from the reference sequence (GRCh37/hg19 assembly) were considered variations.Six novel and 9 previously described, genetic variations were identified in our population. The novel variations included a large, 83 base pair deletion involving the core promoter region and part of exon 1 (1 of 96 children), and a 2 base pair deletion in the coding sequence of exon 4 (1 of 96 children). The remaining novel variations were located in the introns in the proximity of the splice sites. Novel mutations in GLUT3 were observed among 6.25% of our population. Additionally, the frequency of the rare allele for rs17847972 located in a splice donor site is higher (P < .001) in MM in our population than expected.We identified previously undescribed deletions and single-nucleotide variations involving the GLUT3 gene that may be associated with increased susceptibility to MM. Of particular interest, the 2 deletions involve both an important core promoter site and a coding region predicted to have a deleterious effect. The functional significance of these findings is under investigation.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813597","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Spina bifida","weight":0.819225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Intron","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.713286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.658378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Frederick Sanger","weight":0.610151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.313385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Reference genome","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_genome"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Glucose transporter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_transporter"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Binomial nomenclature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
