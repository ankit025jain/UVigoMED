{"id":75196,"title":"IPX066 , a mixed immediate/sustained-release levodopa preparation for Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"L-DOPA has long been the 'gold standard' treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but suffers from poor oral bioavailability and rapid pharmacokinetic elimination. A longer acting preparation has long been sought.We conducted PubMed search for IPX066 and reviewed abstracts from meetings that included the topic of PD. IPX066 is a novel mixed immediate release (IR) and sustained-release levodopa preparation designed to prolong the clinical effect of a single dose. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate similar time to peak dose as regular IR L-DOPA, but a longer duration of time with > 50% of peak dose. This contrasts with available controlled release preparations that have a delay to onset. Clinic trials in fluctuating PD patients show that IPX066 provided more 'on' time despite fewer daily doses, compared to IR L-DOPA. As expected, it was also superior to placebo in early PD. However, it is not known whether it can achieve l-DOPA levels that are continuous enough to delay the onset of fluctuations when given early in the disease.Although not a radical advance in L-DOPA therapy, the drug will clearly have a role in more advanced patients taking multiple L-DOPA doses and may have a role as first-line therapy when starting l-DOPA.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146967","annotations":[{"name":"L-DOPA","weight":0.901493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.686366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.565859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.346269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Internetwork Packet Exchange","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork_Packet_Exchange"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Abstract art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
