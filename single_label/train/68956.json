{"id":68956,"title":"Integrin-linked kinase: a new member of the kinases involved in hypertensive end-organ damage?","abstract":"Integrin-linked kinase predominantly localizes at focal adhesions to regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics, including cell migration and matrix remodelling. Although recent studies have suggested both physiological and pathophysiological roles of integrin-linked kinase in the cardiovascular and renal system, its involvement in hypertensive organ dysfunctions, such as those that occur in kidney, has not been investigated. In the present issue of Clinical Science, Alique and co-workers have demonstrated that angiotensin II-induced renal inflammatory responses were attenuated in mice with conditional deficiency of integrin-linked kinase, which were associated with suppression of nuclear factor ?B activation and reactive oxygen species generation but not hypertension. The significance, potential mechanisms and future direction are presented and discussed in this Commentary.
