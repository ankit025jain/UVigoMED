{"id":55735,"title":"Evidence-based nutritional advice for patients affected by age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"This paper presents the evidence available in the literature on the role of nutrients in preventing the occurrence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and its progression to more advanced stages. In our analysis we considered publications on vitamins B, C, E and D, carotenoids (i.e. lutein, zeaxanthin and ?-carotene), ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and zinc published between 2003 and 2013. While the evidence supporting supplementation and higher dietary intake of nutrients for AMD prevention is weak to moderate, large and robust randomised controlled trials showed that the AREDS formula leads to a 25% reduction in progression to advanced AMD in individuals belonging to AREDS categories 3 and 4. After reviewing the current literature, which includes the AREDS2 study, we suggest an 'evidence-based formula'.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24821294","annotations":[{"name":"Zeaxanthin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeaxanthin"},{"name":"Lutein","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.874809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Carotenoid","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.732012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Carotene","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.583441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.350246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.234399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Age-Related Eye Disease Study","weight":0.109342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age-Related_Eye_Disease_Study"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
