{"id":26991,"title":"[The markers of lipid transport system of blood and annual prognosis of cardiac infarction].","abstract":"The sampling included 133 patients with diagnosis of cardiac infarction with peak of segment ST. After a year after old cardiac infarction, in 38 patients were established such unfavorable outcomes of disease as progressive stenocardia, decompensation of cardiac failure, repeated cardiac infarction and lethal outcome. It is established that among all indicators of lipid profile detected at hospital period of cardiac infarction only three indicators are prognostically significant in groups of patients with different outcomes--levels of free fatty acids, oxidized modified lipoproteins of low density and antibodies to them. During hospital period, augmentation of concentration of free fatty acids, oxidized modified lipoproteins of low density and antibodies to them increases risk of development of distant complications of cardiac infarction. The mathematical model is proposed comprising as predictors free fatty acids and antibodies to oxidized modified lipoproteins of low density. This model makes it possible on the basis of biochemical data obtained during hospital period, to calculate individual cumulative risk and to develop long-term prognosis of probable outcome of cardiac infarction.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069218","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.686856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.632123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.572465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.474321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.393163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.242525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.194121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
