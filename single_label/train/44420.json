{"id":44420,"title":"Predictive factors for perioperative blood transfusions in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.","abstract":"Allogeneic perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) has been associated with higher rates of postoperative complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery and increased tumor recurrence in cancer patients. Our aim is to evaluate possible predictive factors for PBT, specifically, in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery, in order to identify patients who could benefit from alternatives to allogenic PBT such as erythropoietin administration, autologous blood transfusion, and possibly preoperative blood transfusion.Five hundred patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery between the years 2003 and 2011 were reviewed. Patient demographics and clinicopathologic variables were collected prospectively. Other clinical data were collected directly from the computerized records of the in-hospital blood bank. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogenic red blood cells during the day of operation or within the postoperative hospitalization. The associations between PBT and patient variables were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.Of the 500 patients, 134 patients (26.8 %) received PBT. Multivariate analysis revealed four preoperative variables as significant risk factors for PBT: preoperative hemoglobin (P?=?0.001), lower rectal surgery (P?=?0.009), Charlson comorbidity score (P?=?0.001), and malignancy (P?=?0.024).Preoperative Charlson score, hemoglobin level, carcinoma, and lower rectum pathologies were found to be independent risk factors for PBT in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Evaluation of these risk factors prior to surgery may be helpful in selecting the patients who could benefit from possible alternatives to perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion and help constitute guidelines for a more responsible use of these alternatives.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736986","annotations":[{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood bank","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_bank"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.644486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.542013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colorectal surgery","weight":0.407957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_surgery"},{"name":"Allogenic succession","weight":0.146078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogenic_succession"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"George W.
