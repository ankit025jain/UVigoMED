{"id":89310,"title":"Fat embolism syndrome after nailing an isolated open tibial fracture in a stable patient: a case report.","abstract":"Fat embolism syndrome is a potentially fatal complication of long bone fractures. It is usually seen in the context of polytrauma or a femoral fracture. There are few reports of fat embolism syndrome occurring after isolated long bone fractures other than those of the femur.We describe a case of fat embolism syndrome in a 33-year-old Caucasian man. He was being seen for an isolated Gustilo's grade II open tibial fracture. He was deemed clinically stable, so we proceeded to treat the fracture with intramedullary reamed nailing. He developed fat embolism syndrome intraoperatively and was treated successfully.This case caused us to question the use of injury severity scoring for isolated long bone fractures. It suggests that parameters that have been described in the literature other than that the patient is apparently clinically stable should be used to establish the best time for nailing a long bone fracture, thereby improving patient safety.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731759","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.877761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.769543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.686327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.40913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fat embolism","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_embolism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Reamer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamer"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
