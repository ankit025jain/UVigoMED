{"id":47023,"title":"Management and outcome of pouch-vaginal fistulas after IPAA surgery.","abstract":"After IPAA, the timing, management, and outcome of pouch-vaginal fistulas are poorly defined.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency, management, and outcome of patients who develop a pouch-vaginal fistula.This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database.The study was conducted in a single-center, high-volume tertiary referral colorectal unit.Women with a pouch-vaginal fistula after IPAA from 1983 to 2010 were included in the study.The healing rate of pouch-vaginal fistulas was measured.Of 152 patients with a pouch-vaginal fistula after IPAA, 59 fistulas occurred at <12 months, constituting the early onset group, and 43 occurred at >12 months, constituting the late-onset group. Seventy-five patients (77.3%) underwent local repair (48 (49.5%) had ileal pouch advancement flap and 27 (27.8%) had transvaginal repair). The healing rate after ileal pouch advancement flap performed as a primary procedure was 42% and 66% when performed secondarily after a different procedure. The healing rate for transvaginal repair was 55% when done as a primary procedure and 40% when performed secondarily. Nineteen patients underwent redo ileal pouch construction, with an overall pouch retention rate of 40%. At median follow-up of 83 months (range, 5-480 months), 56 (57.7%) of the 102 patients had healed the pouch-vaginal fistula, whereas pouch failure occurred in 34 women (35%, 12 early onset and 22 late onset). Healing of the fistula was significantly lower (22% versus 73%; p < 0.001) and pouch failure higher (52.7% versus 22.7%, p < 0.001) when compared with Crohn's disease. On multivariate analysis, a postoperative delayed diagnosis of Crohn's disease was associated with failure (p = 0.01). No other factors were associated with pouch failure.This was a retrospective study.Pouch-vaginal fistula after IPAA surgery is indolent and may persist after repairs. A delayed diagnosis of Crohn's disease is associated with a poor outcome and a higher chance of pouch failure.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608306","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.562038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Ileo-anal pouch","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileo-anal_pouch"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Retention rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_rate"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Undo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
