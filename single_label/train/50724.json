{"id":50724,"title":"Distinct cell clusters touching islet cells induce islet cell replication in association with over-expression of Regenerating Gene (REG) protein in fulminant type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Pancreatic islet endocrine cell-supporting architectures, including islet encapsulating basement membranes (BMs), extracellular matrix (ECM), and possible cell clusters, are unclear.The architectures around islet cell clusters, including BMs, ECM, and pancreatic acinar-like cell clusters, were studied in the non-diabetic state and in the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes in humans.Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that human islet cell clusters and acinar-like cell clusters adhere directly to each other with desmosomal structures and coated-pit-like structures between the two cell clusters. The two cell-clusters are encapsulated by a continuous capsule composed of common BMs/ECM. The acinar-like cell clusters have vesicles containing regenerating (REG) I? protein. The vesicles containing REG I? protein are directly secreted to islet cells. In the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes, the acinar-like cell clusters over-expressed REG I? protein. Islet endocrine cells, including beta-cells and non-beta cells, which were packed with the acinar-like cell clusters, show self-replication with a markedly increased number of Ki67-positive cells.The acinar-like cell clusters touching islet endocrine cells are distinct, because the cell clusters are packed with pancreatic islet clusters and surrounded by common BMs/ECM. Furthermore, the acinar-like cell clusters express REG I? protein and secrete directly to neighboring islet endocrine cells in the non-diabetic state, and the cell clusters over-express REG I? in the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes with marked self-replication of islet cells.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759849","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.79768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.744587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.743735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.740442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.194532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Desmosome","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmosome"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
