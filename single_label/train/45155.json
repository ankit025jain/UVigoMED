{"id":45155,"title":"Isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease: trial lawyer misuse of science and FDA warnings.","abstract":"Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the FDA and Hoffman La Roche issued warnings of a possible causal association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. While scientists studied the association, trial lawyers used the courts to award large sums of money to plaintiffs despite the absence of clear scientific evidence of a causal effect. In this Issue of the Journal, a well-designed, large pharmaco-epidemiologic study shows no association. The story of isotretinoin highlights the problems that occur when the FAERS is used in litigation prior to further study and scientific analysis.
