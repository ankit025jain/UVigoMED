{"id":80041,"title":"The protective effect of CD40 ligand-CD40 signalling is limited during the early phase of Plasmodium infection.","abstract":"?? T cells are essential for eliminating Plasmodium berghei XAT. Because administration of the agonistic anti-CD40 antibody can induce elimination of P. berghei XAT parasites in ?? T cell-deficient mice, we considered that ?? T cells might activate dendritic cells via CD40 signalling during infection. Here we report that administration of the anti-CD40 antibody to ?? T cell-deficient mice 3-10 days post-P. berghei XAT infection could eliminate the parasites. Our data suggest that dendritic cell activation via ?? T cells expressing CD40 ligand is critical during the early phase of infection.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815981","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.730973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.716845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.544446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"CD40 (protein)","weight":0.337041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD40_(protein)"},{"name":"CD154","weight":0.277528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD154"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.259399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.251389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Plasmodium berghei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_berghei"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"XLRI Admission Test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLRI_Admission_Test"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
