{"id":80975,"title":"[Wetland protection and Oncomelania hupensis control].","abstract":"The wetland is the unique ecosystem that is formed by the interaction between water and land on the earth surface. At present, the wetland ecology and wetland protection is becoming a more and more attention. Oncomelania hupensis is also a wetland creature that is the only snail host for spreading schistosomiasis japonica. The chemical drugs and environmental modification are usually used to the snail control in the schistosomiasis prevention and control. These control measures have different degrees of influence on wetland ecology. In order to meet the requirements of wetland protection, and to strengthen the research of the snail control appropriate technologies on wetland, this paper expounds the influence of different types of wetlands on Oncomelania and the influence of the snail control on wetland ecology. This paper also discusses the countermeasures of snail control of wetlands.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490373","annotations":[{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.860244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Ecosystem","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Wetland","weight":0.745207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.310256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Appropriate technology","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0501171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Weather control","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_control"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"}]}
