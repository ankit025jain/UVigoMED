{"id":79163,"title":"[Correlation of VEGF expression with microvessel and microlymphatic density in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To study the expression of VEGF in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma and its correlations with microvessel density (MVD), microlymphatic vessel density (MLVD).The expression of VEGF, MVD and MLVD in 41 cases of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma were detected by immunohistochemical technique.In the sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, the positive rate of VEGF was 82.9% (34/41). The over expression of VEGF was related with tumor invasion, histological grading and lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.05). The MVD of cases with positive VEGF expression was significantly higher than those without VEGF expression (P < 0.05), but was not statistical difference in MLVD (P > 0.05).VEGF may participate in the metastasis of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma through promoting vascularization in the tumors, but not promoting MLVD.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479355","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.698854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.66794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.588503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Russia)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"}]}
