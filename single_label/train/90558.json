{"id":90558,"title":"Needlestick and sharps injuries among resident physicians: an institutional review.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to investigate the reported incidence of percutaneous injuries among resident physicians. A retrospective review of the Injury Surveillance Database (ISD) was conducted. The subjects included resident physicians reporting to occupational health services between January 2000 and January 2008. A total of 378 percutaneous injuries were reported between 2000 and 2008, of which 285 were needlesticks and 93 were sharps-related injuries. Fifty-six percent of reports were from male resident physicians and 44% were from female resident physicians. Hollow-bore needles (45%) were more commonly reported than suture needles (30%) and the operating room (18%) was found to be the most common place where injuries occurred. We observed a decreasing trend in reportinginjuries as the year of postgraduate training level increased. There was no statistical significance (P=0.5) in reported percutaneous injuries between surgical and nonsurgical resident physicians. The reported percutaneous injuries have displayed a decreasing trend since 2006. Additional surveillance data will be needed for future policy intervention.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600774","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Public policy","weight":0.527163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.450483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Postgraduate education","weight":0.210308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Residency (medicine)","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"378","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/378"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"Sharp (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_(music)"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Bear market","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_market"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
