{"id":92473,"title":"The self-aligning knee prosthesis: clinical and radiological outcome and survival analysis of a cruciate retaining meniscal bearing knee at 10-year follow-up.","abstract":"Previously, the clinical and radiological results of the self-aligning cruciate retaining total knee prosthesis at 5-years follow-up were described. The 10-year follow-up is now reported to determine the clinical and radiological results and the survival of the prosthesis.A 10-year follow-up was performed in this prospectively followed cohort of 246 (232 patients) self-aligning, cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasties performed between 1995 and 1998. Because patients had died and others suffered from comorbidities making them unable to attend a follow-up consultation, data could be obtained for 105 prostheses. Clinical results were evaluated by the Knee Society Score, and radiological follow-up was performed on standard AP and lateral X-rays. All radiographs were evaluated for the presence of radiolucencies, osteolysis and wear.At the 10-year follow-up, there were no new cases of revision so that the cumulative survival rate at 10 years remains 95%. The 10-year follow-up shows good clinical results with an average Knee Society Score of 154 (SD 35.7) and an average range of motion of 109° (SD 13.7). After excluding 25 prostheses for comorbidities, the mean 10-year KSS score increased from 154 to 163 (SD 26.2). On the other hand, for the ROM, the exclusion of the 25 prostheses had no influence on the mean ROM value of 109°. At the 10-year follow-up, none of the 100 available radiographs showed any radiolucencies >2 mm on any component.Long-term follow-up of the mobile bearing, cruciate retaining, SAL-II total knee arthroplasty shows excellent clinical and radiological results without bearing dislocation.Prospective cohort, Level IV.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23839209","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.234625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"California's 13th State Senate district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_13th_State_Senate_district"},{"name":"California's 35th State Senate district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_35th_State_Senate_district"},{"name":"California's 26th State Senate district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_26th_State_Senate_district"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Newton's laws of motion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 10","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_10"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
