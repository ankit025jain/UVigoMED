{"id":89881,"title":"Development of a novel calcium phosphate cement composed mainly of calcium sodium phosphate with high osteoconductivity.","abstract":"Two novel calcium phosphate cements (CPC) have been developed using calcium sodium phosphate (CSP) as the main ingredient. The first of these cements, labeled CAC, contained CSP, ?-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), and anhydrous citric acid, whereas the second, labeled CABC, contained CSP, ?-TCP, ?-TCP, and anhydrous citric acid. Biopex(®)-R (PENTAX, Tokyo, Japan), which is a commercially available CPC (Com-CPC), and OSferion(®) (Olympus Terumo Biomaterials Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which is a commercially available porous ?-TCP, were used as reference controls for analysis. In vitro analysis showed that CABC set in 5.7 ± 0.3 min at 22 °C and had a compressive strength of 86.0 ± 9.7 MPa after 5 days. Furthermore, this material had a compressive strength of 26.7 ± 3.7 MPa after 2 h in physiologic saline. CAC showed a statistically significantly lower compressive strength in the presence of physiologic saline and statistically significantly longer setting times than those of CABC. CABC and CAC exhibited apatite-forming abilities in simulated body fluid that were faster than that of Com-CPC. Samples of the materials were implanted into the femoral condyles of rabbits for in vivo analysis, and subsequent histological examinations revealed that CABC exhibited superior osteoconductivity and equivalent bioresorbability compared with Com-CPC, as well as superior osteoconductivity and bioresorbability compared with CAC. CABC could therefore be used as an alternative bone substitute material.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671331","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.863479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.760635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Citric acid","weight":0.749069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.711219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.630477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.610052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.50132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Tricalcium phosphate","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricalcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Anhydrous","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhydrous"},{"name":"Compressive strength","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength"},{"name":"Tokyo","weight":0.212232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.192973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sodium phosphates","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_phosphates"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0204755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Communist Party of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Cermet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cermet"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Biomaterial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
