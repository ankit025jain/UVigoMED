{"id":80314,"title":"Sustained clearance of Mansonella ozzardi infection after treatment with ivermectin in the Brazilian Amazon.","abstract":"Therapy for mansonelliasis is challenging because there is no standard drug recommended for its treatment. This non-randomized study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose of 0.15 mg/kg of ivermectin to reduce Mansonella ozzardi microfilaraemia in infected persons. A total of 74 patients were studied within the municipality of LÃ¡brea, which is located in Amazonas State, Brazil. The patients were treated with ivermectin after detection of the parasite by blood examination. Significant microfilaraemia reduction was observed and its residual effect was maintained for at least 12 months. There was no significant change in the laboratory blood count, hepatic metabolites, and nitrogen-bounding compound excreta dosage values that could compromise the use of this drug, demonstrating that ivermectin has a low toxicity level.
