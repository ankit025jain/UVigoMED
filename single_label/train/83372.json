{"id":83372,"title":"Four-copy number intervals in SNP microarray analysis: unique patterns and positions.","abstract":"Over the past several years, the utility of microarray technology in delineating copy number changes has become well established. In the past 4 years, we have used the SNP array to detect and analyze allele ratios in 150 cases with 4-copy intervals, confirmed by FISH, offering insight into the underlying mechanisms of formation. These cases may be divided into 5 allele patterns--the first 4 of which involve a single homologue--as detected by the genotyping aspects of the microarray: (1) triplications combining homozygous and heterozygous alleles, with a 3:1 ratio of heterozygotes; (2) triplications with allele patterns combining homozygous and heterozygous alleles, with heterozygote ratios of both 3:1 and 2:2; (3) triplications that have homozygous alleles combined with only 2:2 heterozygous alleles; (4) triplications that are completely homozygous; and (5) homozygous duplications on each homologue with no heterozygous alleles. The implications of copy number variants with diverse allelic segregations are presented in this study.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401283","annotations":[{"name":"Heterozygote","weight":0.840078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.826667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.826667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.822872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.775131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"SNP array","weight":0.3,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_array"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Diffraction topography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_topography"}]}
