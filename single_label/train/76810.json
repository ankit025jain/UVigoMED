{"id":76810,"title":"Melanocortin 4 receptors in autonomic neurons regulate thermogenesis and glycemia.","abstract":"Whether melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4Rs) in extra-hypothalamic neurons, including cholinergic autonomic pre-ganglionic neurons, are required to control energy and glucose homeostasis is unclear. We found that MC4Rs in sympathetic, but not parasympathetic, pre-ganglionic neurons were required to regulate energy expenditure and body weight, including thermogenic responses to diet and cold exposure and 'beiging' of white adipose tissue. Deletion of Mc4r genes in both sympathetic and parasympathetic cholinergic neurons impaired glucose homeostasis.
