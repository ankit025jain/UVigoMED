{"id":34416,"title":"Use of ultrasound in the haemodynamic assessment of the sick neonate.","abstract":"Clinician performed ultrasound (CPU) by the clinician caring for a sick patient is increasingly used in critical care specialties. The real-time haemodynamic information obtained helps the clinician to understand underlying physiology, target treatment and refine clinical decision-making. Neonatologists are increasingly using ultrasound to assess sick neonates with a range of clinical presentations and demand for training and accreditation programmes is increasing. This review discusses the current expanded uses for CPU in the haemodynamic assessment of the sick neonate.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736479","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.638494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.54322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Accreditation","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accreditation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0320572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Central processing unit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Supply and demand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
