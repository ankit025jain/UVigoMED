{"id":9596,"title":"Novel coronavirus and astrovirus in Delaware Bay shorebirds.","abstract":"Wild birds are an important but to some extent under-studied reservoir for emerging pathogens. We used unbiased sequencing methods for virus discovery in shorebird samples from the Delaware Bay, USA; an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds.Analysis of shorebird fecal samples indicated the presence of a novel astrovirus and coronavirus. A sanderling sample yielded sequences with distant homology to avian nephritis virus 1, an astrovirus associated with acute nephritis in poultry. A ruddy turnstone sample yielded sequences with homology to deltacoronaviruses.Our findings highlight shorebirds as a virus reservoir and the need to closely monitor wild bird populations for the emergence of novel virus variants.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699424","annotations":[{"name":"Wader","weight":0.888484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.757227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Turnstone","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstone"},{"name":"Ruddy Turnstone","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruddy_Turnstone"},{"name":"Sanderling","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanderling"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.389044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.311204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.258068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Delaware Bay","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Bay"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Astrovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrovirus"},{"name":"Delaware","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0218433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Ruddy Duck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruddy_Duck"},{"name":"Understudy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"Bias of an estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"}]}
