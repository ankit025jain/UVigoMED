{"id":26812,"title":"Echocardiography of the mitral valve.","abstract":"Echocardiography is the primary imaging modality for assessment of the mitral valve (MV). It provides an accurate and non-invasive tool to assess the morphology, geometry and function of the MV apparatus, which form the basis of the mechanisms and classification of MV disease. This review highlights the mechanistic insights into MV dysfunction by echocardiography and the critical role of echocardiography in the quantitative assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25081402","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.541582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.189677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Mitral stenosis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_stenosis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.0332281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.0321906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"}]}
