About 200 cases have been reported in the literature. It may be associated with neural tube defects. We encountered a 3-day-old female child with this presentation, who was successfully operated on at the age of about 2 months. Being an uncommon entity, it is presented here.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526054","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.309714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.0629808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.0536471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Parasitic twin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_twin"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
