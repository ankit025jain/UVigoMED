{"id":90034,"title":"Reoperation after combat-related major lower extremity amputations.","abstract":"Complication rates leading to reoperation after trauma-related amputations remain ill defined in the literature. We sought to identify and quantify the indications for reoperation in our combat-injured patients.Retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients.Tertiary Military Medical Center.Combat-wounded personnel sustaining 300 major lower extremity amputations from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom from 2005 to 2009.We performed a retrospective analysis of injury and treatment-related data, complications, and revision of amputation data. Prerevision and postrevision outcome measures were identified for all patients.The primary outcome measure was the reoperation on an amputation after a previous definitive closure. Secondary outcome measures included ambulatory status, prosthesis use, medication use, and return to duty status.At a mean follow-up of 23 months (interquartile range: 16-32), 156 limbs required reoperation leading to a 53% overall reoperation rate. Ninety-one limbs had 1 indication for reoperation, whereas 65 limbs had more than 1 indication for reoperation. There were a total of 261 distinct indications for reoperation leading to a total of 465 additional surgical procedures. Repeat surgery was performed semiurgently for postoperative wound infection (27%) and sterile wound dehiscence/wound breakdown (4%). Revision amputation surgery was also performed electively for persistently symptomatic residual limbs due to the following indications: symptomatic heterotopic ossification (24%), neuromas (11%), scar revision (8%), and myodesis failure (6%). Transtibial amputations were more likely than transfemoral amputations to be revised due to symptomatic neuromata (P = 0.004; odds ratio [OR] = 3.7; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.45-9.22). Knee disarticulations were less likely to require reoperation when compared with all other amputation levels (P = 0.0002; OR = 7.6; 95% CI = 2.2-21.4).In our patient population, reoperation to address urgent surgical complications was consistent with previous reports on trauma-related amputations. Additionally, persistently symptomatic residual limbs were common and reoperation to address the pathology was associated with an improvement in ambulatory status and led to a decreased dependence on pain medications.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658066","annotations":[{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.819817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.558668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.298053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.145853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.108802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Heterotopic ossification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopic_ossification"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mental breakdown","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_breakdown"},{"name":"Liberty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty"},{"name":"Neuroma","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroma"}]}
