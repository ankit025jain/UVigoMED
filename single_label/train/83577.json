{"id":83577,"title":"Open arterial revascularization of the critically ischemic foot using arterial homograft.","abstract":"Revascularization alternatives for patients with critical limb ischemia and without adequate autogenous vein remain challenging. We reviewed our experience with the use of arterial homograft as a conduit for limb salvage in patients with limb ischemia and active lower extremity infections.A retrospective review of patients who underwent open arterial revascularization of the lower extremity with cryopreserved femoral artery homograft for the treatment of symptomatic critical limb ischemia (i.e., foot ulceration, infection, or gangrene) during an 18-month period was performed. Relevant clinical variables and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Clinical success was defined as limb salvage for one year, patency of the reconstruction, and wound healing.Thirteen patients (5 men; average age 71 +/- 83 years, range 51-87 years) were treated during this study period. Treatment indications included 10 (77%) foot ulcerations, 2 (15%) critically ischemic limbs without ulceration, and 1 (8%) infected polytetrafluoroethylene bypass graft with acute occlusion and limb ischemia. A femoral below-the-knee popliteal bypass was performed in 4 (1%), femoral to anterior tibial artery in 4 (31%), femoral to posterior tibial artery in 3 (23%), and femoral to peroneal artery in 2 (15%). All 13 limbs were preserved. Minor amputations were performed in 6 patients, 2 underwent toe amputations and 4 patients had a trans-metatarsal amputation. The cumulative patency rate at 6, 9, and 18 months was 92.3%, 70.3%, and 58.6%, respectively.Open arterial revascularization with arterial femoral homograft is an acceptable treatment method in patients with critical limb ischemia and active infection in whom autogenous vein is not available or the use of a synthetic conduit is not possible.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306791","annotations":[{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Gangrene","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangrene"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.785842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.777682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.756922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.404608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.398857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.353247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.344539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.312706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.310848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.295072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.25977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.198784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Anterior tibial artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_tibial_artery"},{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Fibular artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibular_artery"},{"name":"Posterior tibial artery","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_tibial_artery"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Posterior tibial vein","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_tibial_vein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"}]}
