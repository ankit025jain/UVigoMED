{"id":54439,"title":"The extracellular matrix protein MAGP1 supports thermogenesis and protects against obesity and diabetes through regulation of TGF-?.","abstract":"Microfibril-associated glycoprotein 1 (MAGP1) is a component of extracellular matrix microfibrils. Here we show that MAGP1 expression is significantly altered in obese humans, and inactivation of the MAGP1 gene (Mfap2(-/-)) in mice results in adipocyte hypertrophy and predisposition to metabolic dysfunction. Impaired thermoregulation was evident in Mfap2(-/-) mice prior to changes in adiposity, suggesting a causative role for MAGP1 in the increased adiposity and predisposition to diabetes. By 5 weeks of age, Mfap2(-/-) mice were maladaptive to cold challenge, uncoupling protein-1 expression was attenuated in the brown adipose tissue, and there was reduced browning of the subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Levels of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) activity were elevated in Mfap2(-/-) adipose tissue, and the treatment of Mfap2(-/-) mice with a TGF-?-neutralizing antibody improved their body temperature and prevented the increased adiposity phenotype. Together, these findings indicate that the regulation of TGF-? by MAGP1 is protective against the effects of metabolic stress, and its absence predisposes individuals to metabolic dysfunction.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458361","annotations":[{"name":"Brown adipose tissue","weight":0.88969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.84275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Thermogenesis","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenesis"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"White adipose tissue","weight":0.654808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.631935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.630392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.409085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.233088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Uncoupling protein","weight":0.0932836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncoupling_protein"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Brown algae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Microfibril","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfibril"},{"name":"Viral matrix protein","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_matrix_protein"}]}
