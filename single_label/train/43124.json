{"id":43124,"title":"Advanced therapy for inflammatory bowel disease: a guide for the primary care physician.","abstract":"Primary care physicians care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are receiving advanced therapies that include immunomodulator drugs (eg, azathioprine and methotrexate) and biologic therapy. These agents have significantly improved remission rates and the quality of life for patients suffering from IBD. However, patients taking these drugs need special care and counseling with regard to adverse effects, infection risk, cancer risk, and pregnancy. Newer treatment paradigms incorporate earlier use of biologic therapy, often in combination with immunomodulator drugs, to alter the natural course of the disease. Comprehensive care for these patients, including health maintenance, requires collaboration between primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Despite their high cost, advanced therapies are likely to be cost-effective. This article discusses general concepts about azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and common biologic drugs used in IBD.
