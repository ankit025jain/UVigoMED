{"id":21392,"title":"[Comparative characteristic of the treatment efficacy in patients with often recurrent acute respiratory infections complicated with immunodeficiency treated with likopid].","abstract":"It was analysed the fascinating and metabolic phagocytic activity of neutrophilis (cationic-protein, myeloperoxidase and latex tests, NST-test: spontaneous and stimulated, stimulation index) in patients with often recurrent acute respiratory infections on the base of immunodeficiency disorders who received sublingual drug Licopid in dose of 1 mg/daily (30 patients) and 3 mg/daily (30 patients) during 14 days. It was found that Licopid in the daily dose of 3 mg could lead to more rapid regression of clinical symptoms of acute respiratory disease, more intensive strengthening neutrophils absorption capacity, metabolic and protease activity, activated by myeloperoxidase and cationic proteins. To improve of neutrophils phagocytic activity in patients with frequent acute respiratory diseases on the base of immunodeficiency disorders it could be recommended to increase the total dose of Licopid to 3 mg/daily and the frequency of repeated courses during the year, especially for patients of immunocompromised group.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605620","annotations":[{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.697749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.655795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.649819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.580419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.445704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.390148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.239644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.115319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"}]}
