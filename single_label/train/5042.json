{"id":5042,"title":"Femoral neck fractures: a changing paradigm.","abstract":"Surgical interventions consisting of internal fixation (IF) or total hip replacement (THR) are required to restore patient mobility after hip fractures. Conventionally, this decision was based solely upon the degree of fracture displacement. However, in the last ten years, there has been a move to incorporate patient characteristics into the decision making process. Research demonstrating that joint replacement renders superior functional results when compared with IF, in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures, has swayed the pendulum in favour of THR. However, a high risk of dislocation has always been the concern. Fortunately, there are newer technologies and alternative surgical approaches that can help reduce the risk of dislocation. The authors propose an algorithm for the treatment of femoral neck fractures: if minimally displaced, in the absence of hip joint arthritis, IF should be performed; if arthritis is present, or the fracture is displaced, then THR is preferred.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381407","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.712613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.645079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.641531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.560445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.487732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Intermediate frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_frequency"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical abbreviations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation,_aerospace_and_aeronautical_abbreviations"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"},{"name":"Pendulum","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum"}]}
