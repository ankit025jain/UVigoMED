{"id":38211,"title":"Perforating disorders of the skin.","abstract":"Perforating disorders of the skin, is an often overlooked entity characterized by transepidermal elimination of material from the upper dermis and are classified histopathologically according to the type of epidermal disruption and the nature of the eliminated material. They include Kyrle's disease, perforating folliculitis, reactive perforating collagenosis, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa.The aim of this study was to delineate the clinical and histopathological features of perforating disorders of the skin.In our study, we reviewed last 2 years skin biopsies received by us. Hematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined and histochemical stainings (elastic van Gieson and Masson trichrome stains) were also used for histopathological evaluation.We reviewed five cases of perforating disorders of skin which included two cases of Kyrle's disease, two cases of reactive perforating collagenosis and a single case of perforating folliculitis. Two patients had family history of perforating dermatosis in their siblings and three had associated systemic disease.Perforating disorders of the skin should be considered when ulcer with keratotic plugs is found.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441221","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.743269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.384499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.343764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.265441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Folliculitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculitis"},{"name":"Van Gieson's stain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gieson's_stain"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Keratosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis"},{"name":"Masson's trichrome stain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masson's_trichrome_stain"},{"name":"Plug (fishing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_(fishing)"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Van","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Anunnaki","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
