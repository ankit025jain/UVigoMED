{"id":78820,"title":"Doxycycline or oral corticosteroids for nasal polyps.","abstract":"The study by Van Zele et al reports positive results for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that used either 20 days of doxycycline (200 mg the first day, followed by 100 mg daily) or 20 days of a tapering schedule of methyl prednisolone (32 mg on days 1-5, 16 mg on days 6-10, and 8 mg on days 11-20) for the treatment of nasal polyps. The primary end point was reduction in nasal polyp score which was graded 0 to 4 on each side, resulting in a score range of 0 to 8; the score was determined at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Entry criteria required that the patient either have recurrent polyps after surgery or massive polyps (grade 3 or 4); the total polyp score in each of the 3 groups averaged approximately 6. The patient population in this study was therefore at the severe end of the spectrum; results may not be generalizable to patients with milder disease.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565635","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Doxycycline","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.624632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.598784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.533295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.41327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.412794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.36501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.213174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Zele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zele"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"1120","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1120"},{"name":"Van, Turkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van,_Turkey"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Generalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.0144303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"}]}
