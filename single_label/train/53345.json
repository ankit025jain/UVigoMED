{"id":53345,"title":"IVS1 -397T>C estrogen receptor ? polymorphism is associated with low-grade systemic inflammatory response in type 1 diabetic girls.","abstract":"The study aimed to investigate the influence of estrogen receptor ? (ER-?) genotypes on inflammatory response and development of microvascular complications in girls with type 1 diabetes.152 young regularly menstruating girls with diagnosed type 1 diabetes and 84 young, healthy menstruating girls were recruited. ER-? genotyping was carried out by PCR. Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol, as well as IL-6, TNF-?, VEGF, and IL-10, were measured. CD4(+)Foxp3(+) TH17 cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry.Type 1 diabetic girls carrying TT genotype were characterized by the lowest serum estradiol level and IL-10 and highest IL-6, TNF-?, and VEGF. The association between the level of certain cytokine and the genetic variant of estrogen receptor ? polymorphism was analyzed. Frequencies of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) TH17 cells were also enhanced in TT bearing girls with type 1 diabetes and correlated with the level of analyzed cytokines. In addition, the correlation between serum estradiol level and cytokine concentrations was observed.We propose that TT variant of estrogen receptor ? polymorphism may be associated with enhanced inflammatory response, which in turn may lead to acceleration of diabetic retino- and nephropathy in girls with type 1 diabetes. This finding may help the physicians to predict the onset and progression of diabetic microvascular complications.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523574","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.7441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.666585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.59757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.555855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.538545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.505341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.486506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.31147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Tyrosine hydroxylase","weight":0.135566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.0932836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
