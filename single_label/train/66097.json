{"id":66097,"title":"Do patients with pelvic organ prolapse have an increased frequency of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria?","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) in patients with pelvic organ prolapse.The Urogynecology patient database was reviewed for patients presenting between July 2010 and April 2011 inclusive. We compared the prevalence of AMH in patients with no prolapse with those with prolapse. A post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate if overall stage of prolapse was related to the presence of AMH. Pearson chi-square analysis was used for categorical variables, and P values<.05 were deemed statistically significant.Of the 230 women with evaluable AMH data, 29 (12.6%) had AMH. Baseline patient demographic data did not significantly differ between groups. Women with prolapse had a higher prevalence of AMH compared with women with no prolapse (18.3% vs 5.1%, P=.003). There was a significant difference in the distribution of AMH by stage of prolapse, with AMH more prevalent among women with higher stages of prolapse (P=.007).Women with prolapse beyond the hymen have a significantly higher prevalence of AMH when compared with women with prolapse at or above the hymen. We suggest an overall rate of AMH in the Urogynecologic population of 12.6%.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745798","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.234465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.176385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.149946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Hymen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Urogynecology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urogynecology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"Karl Pearson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Stage (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(theatre)"},{"name":"Anatomically modern humans","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_humans"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Categorical data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_data"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Syncretism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Microhematuria","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microhematuria"}]}
