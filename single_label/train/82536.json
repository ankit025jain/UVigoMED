{"id":82536,"title":"Noninvasive restoration of severe erosion by means of CAD/CAM indirect composite occlusal restorations: a technical note.","abstract":"The use of new materials and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing techniques can help dental practitioners efficiently treat dental erosion in a predictable manner. If the vertical dimension of occlusion has to be increased, the static and dynamic occlusion need to be reorganized. This article presents and documents a practical, digital approach to such treatment and discusses possible merits as they relate to treatment time, ease of treatment, and predictability.
