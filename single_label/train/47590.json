{"id":47590,"title":"The elevated preoperative platelet to lymphocyte ratio predicts decreased time to recurrence in colon cancer patients.","abstract":"Recent evidence indicates that tumor progression involves factors of systemic inflammation, such as platelets and lymphocytes. In this study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of the preoperative platelet to lymphocyte (P/L) ratio on time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with stage II and III colon cancer (CC) who underwent curative resection.In this retrospective study, 372 CC patients were included. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional models were calculated for TTR and OS.In univariate analysis, the elevated P/L ratio was significantly associated with decreased TTR (HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.51, P = .040) and remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.58, P = .030), where HR and CI represent Hazard ratio and confidence interval, respectively. Patients with elevated P/L ratio showed a median TTR of 116 months. In contrast, patients with low P/L ratio had a median TTR of 132 months. In OS analysis, the elevated P/L ratio showed a trend toward decreased OS in univariate analysis (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = .95 to 2.48, P = .079).In this study, we identified the preoperative P/L ratio as a prognostic marker for TTR in stage II and III CC patients.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581872","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.882119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.877733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.663236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.606313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.456573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.430758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"}]}
