{"id":45028,"title":"Overexpression of phosphorylated 4E-binding protein 1 predicts lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of Chinese patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","abstract":"Previous studies have confirmed the role of phosphorylated form of 4E-binding protein 1 (p-4E-BP1) as a good candidate tumor biomarker. The aim of this study was to investigate p-4E-BP1 expression status in hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) specimens and to clarify its clinical significance. Tissue microarray containing tumor specimens obtained from 61 patients with HCCA were constructed. p-4E-BP1 was investigated by immunohistochemical studies. High/moderate expression p-4E-BP1 was observed in 57.4% (35/61) primary cancer specimens. Overexpression of p-4E-BP1 protein was associated with poor differentiation and regional lymph node metastasis. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model revealed that p-4E-BP1 overexpression was an independent factor in predicting recurrence-free survival and overall survival for HCCA patients, apart from tumor invasion and complete resection. P-4E-BP1 was highly expressed in HCCA. Overexpressed p-4E-BP1 might be a novel biomarker to predict the clinical outcome of patients with resected HCCA.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706262","annotations":[{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.92815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.679559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.605455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.388002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Hilum (anatomy)","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
