{"id":29007,"title":"Drug allergy in mastocytosis.","abstract":"Drugs are known triggers of anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis even to the association between drug anaphylaxis and mastocytosis does not appear frequently appear. Nevertheless, mast cell disorders might be ruled out in cases of severe systemic reactions. Careful examination of the skin should accompany measurement of basal serum tryptase levels. The data published about drug anaphylaxis in patients with mast cell disorders are scarce, and it is not currently possible to provide clear recommendations. Most papers report cases of anaphylaxis during surgical procedures or radiocontrast media exposure. There are no specific recommendations to prevent severe reactions during such procedures, although some specialists suggest performing premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids before anesthesia or radiocontrast media administration.
