{"id":72201,"title":"Fibromatosis of the breast: a pictorial review of the imaging and histopathology findings.","abstract":"Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare condition that predominantly affects middle-aged women. It is locally aggressive, and exhibits a high incidence of local recurrence. The clinical presentation and radiological appearance are highly suspicious for carcinoma. Definitive diagnosis is made by diagnostic open biopsy. The aim of this review is to illustrate the main radiological and histopathological characteristics of this rare disease to increase awareness of this entity and discuss the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in its management.
