{"id":83897,"title":"Maternal behavior and infant physiology during feeding in premature and term infants over the first year of life.","abstract":"Little is known about the relationship between maternal behavior and the stability of premature infants' physiologic responses during feeding. In a secondary data analysis, we examined relationships between quality of maternal behavior and cardiorespiratory physiology during feeding in 61 premature and 53 term infants at four times over the first year of life. Measures included heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation; Child Feeding Skills Checklist; and Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment. Birthweight, gestational age, and neurodevelopmental risk were covariates. Quality of maternal behavior did not predict infants' physiologic response to feeding. However, birthweight was related to infant feeding physiology among all infants over the first year of life. Stress during fetal life, which may lead to impaired intrauterine growth and low birthweight, may have longitudinal effects on cardiorespiratory functioning of premature infants. Research is needed to further investigate the biological pathways by which maternal-infant interaction supports behavioral and physiologic feeding outcomes of premature infants.","date":"2014-11-14","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223730","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.701197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.659124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.525374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.398606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.37258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.363887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.325614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Respiratory rate","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
