{"id":4960,"title":"[Metabolic and organ protective properties of various infusion solutions and the choice of starting therapy in the pre-admission stage of acetic acid poisoning].","abstract":"We conducted an open prospective study in 60 patients (30 men and 30 women) with acetic acid poisoning. A randomization was performed on the groups, taking into account the tactics of infusion therapy: group I--15 patients who did not receive an infusion therapy at a pre-admission stage; group II--15 patients who received the infiusion therapy with solution of sodium chloride 0.9%; group III--15 patients who received the infusion therapy with modified gelatin (Gelofusinwn), group IV-15 patients who received the infusion therapy with reamberinum.We found that the most favorable results were noted in patients of group IV in the early posttraumatic period.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549483","annotations":[{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.821372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.693124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.615987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.266938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Magic (paranormal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Boron group","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"}]}
