{"id":53323,"title":"Predictive parameters of accelerated muscle loss in men-MINOS study.","abstract":"Aging-related muscle loss is a public health problem. We investigated the association of lifestyle and hormonal factors with a prospectively assessed muscle loss in older men.Among 608 home-dwelling men, aged 60-85 (mean 68) years, lifestyle and health status were evaluated through a questionnaire. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and calculated as the sum of lean mass of the 4 limbs. Free testosterone concentration was calculated using concentrations of total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin. Longitudinal data were analyzed by hierarchical models.Average muscle loss was 0.63 Â± 0.05%/year. The results of our multivariable adjusted analyses showed that muscle loss was higher in men whose leisure physical activity was <15 hours/week versus ?15 hours/week (-0.76 vs -0.57%/year). Age-related acceleration of muscle loss was greater in men with lower total testosterone levels (<10 vs ?10 nmol/L: -0.10 vs -0.07%/year/year of age at baseline [age]). Men with lower free testosterone (<75 vs ?75 pmol/L) had greater age-related acceleration of muscle loss (-0.12 vs -0.08%/year/age). Higher parathyroid hormone concentrations were associated with greater age-related acceleration of muscle loss (?45 vs <45 pg/mL -0.14 vs -0.12%/year/age). Men with type 2 diabetes had higher age-related acceleration of muscle loss versus men without diabetes (-0.08 vs -0.03%/year/age) (All P values are <.05).In elderly men, low leisure physical activity, type 2 diabetes, low total and free testosterone, and elevated parathyroid hormone concentrations are associated with greater age-related acceleration of muscle loss. These factors are likely to represent real determinants of aging-related muscle loss in men.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524994","annotations":[{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.830225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.639962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.513748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.444306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.417791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.152408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Leisure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
