{"id":89362,"title":"Minimal important changes in the Constant-Murley score in patients with subacromial pain.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal important change (MIC) of improvement in the Constant-Murley score in patients with long-standing subacromial pain and in subgroups of patients with subacromial pain with and without rotator cuff ruptures.The MIC was estimated by the anchor-based MIC distribution method, which integrates an anchor- and distribution-based approach: the optimal cutoff point of the receiver operating characteristic curve (MICROC) and the 95% limit cutoff point (MIC95% limit). The study population consisted of 93 patients included in a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of a specific exercise strategy.The MICROC was found at a mean change of 17 points in the Constant-Murley score, which corresponds to a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 79%. The MIC95% limit was found at a mean change of 24 points. In the subgroup analysis, the MICROC was found at a mean change of 19 points and the MIC95% limit at 18 points in patients with an intact rotator cuff. In patients with rotator cuff ruptures, the MICROC was found at a mean change of 15 points and the MIC95% limit at 30 points.The Constant-Murley score is able to detect the MIC in individual patients with long-standing subacromial pain when the rotator cuff is intact. The estimated MIC values could be used as an indication for relevant changes in the Constant-Murley score in clinical practice and guide the clinician in how to interpret the results of specific treatments.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726486","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.778033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.767815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.720349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.521298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.42212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
