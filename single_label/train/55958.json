{"id":55958,"title":"Does aspirin increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration?","abstract":"This commentary on the review by Christen and Chew discusses the controversy surrounding aspirin use and its association with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We address the strength of evidence between low-dose aspirin use and AMD and also discuss the risks and benefits of aspirin use in primary versus secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in these cases. We also highlight an ongoing randomized controlled trial in this area.
