{"id":55687,"title":"Learning curve for use of the sonopet ultrasonic aspirator in endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.","abstract":"The Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator is a surgical tool that uses low-frequency ultrasonic vibrations to fragment tissue while simultaneously irrigating and aspirating the surgical field. This technology is becoming more widely used in orbital, lacrimal, neurological, and skull base surgery, but few studies have examined the learning curve associated with adoption of this technology. We present our surgical learning curve, pearls, and pitfalls using the newest generation Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator Universal handpiece in endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (eDCR) surgery.Retrospective chart review of consecutive eDCR surgeries performed by a single surgeon adopting the Sonopet Universal handpiece. Data collected include demographic information, indications for surgery, surgical time, intraoperative findings, anatomic and functional results, and complications.Twenty-six eDCR surgeries in 20 patients were performed from October 2011 - May 2013. Most patients were female (85.7%) with mean age 53.6 years (range 4-84) and mean follow up of 378 days (range 7-761). For routine unilateral and bilateral surgeries, surgery time decreased by 36.4% and 33.9% before reaching a plateau of 67.2 and 80.7 minutes per case, respectively. Mean surgery time for non-sequential unilateral complex cases was 85.1 minutes, which did not vary significantly over the learning curve. We achieved 100% anatomic success and 84.6% functional success.The Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator Universal handpiece can be used safely and effectively for eDCR surgery. A significant learning curve exists for adoption of this technology. Appropriate handpiece tip selection and machine setting adjustments are crucial for successful adoption of this technology and avoidance of complications.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Eye
