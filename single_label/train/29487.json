{"id":29487,"title":"Young adult waterpipe smokers: Smoking behaviors and associated subjective and physiological effects.","abstract":"The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate smoking behaviors and subjective and physiological effects of nicotine on young adult occasional waterpipe smokers.This study utilized a repeated-measures design that included one repeated factor for condition (nicotine and non-nicotine). For each participant, the sequencing of the repeated factor was assigned using random allocation. The two nicotine conditions were nicotine (0.75 g) and non-nicotine (0 g placebo) tobacco. Over the course of two weeks, twenty-two participants completed subjective (Acute Subjective Effects of Nicotine) and physiological (blood pressure, heart rate, and CO level) measures. Additional measures (QSU and MNWS-R) were used to assess for withdrawal symptoms.The participants (n=22) were young adults (23 Â± 3.1years); 71% smoked waterpipe once a month in the past year and 29% smoked waterpipe 1-2 times per week. In addition, 60% reported sharing their waterpipe with friends while smoking. None of the participants reported using any other forms of tobacco products.Under the nicotine condition, participants tended to smoke longer (i.e. smoking duration, p=0.004), take more puffs (p=0.03), take shorter puffs (p=0.03), and inhale less volume with each puff (p=0.02). The repeated measures analysis of the factor headrush revealed an effect of the nicotine condition (F=9.69, p<0.001, partial ?(2)=0.31) and time (F=8.17, p=0.02, partial ?(2)=0.30). Heart rate increased significantly across the nicotine condition (F=7.92, p=0.01, partial ?(2)=0.31) and over time (F=12.64, p=0.01, partial ?(2)=0.41).This study demonstrates how differences between nicotine and non-nicotine waterpipe smoking are associated with changes in smoking behaviors, experiencing a headrush and an increase in heart rate.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657000","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.694587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.688708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.687712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.477112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.370133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.295934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.276395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Tobacco products","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_products"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Factor XII","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_XII"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Factor VIII","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_VIII"},{"name":"Factor VII","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_VII"},{"name":"Factor IX","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_IX"},{"name":"Puffs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffs"},{"name":"Air pollution dispersion terminology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_dispersion_terminology"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"}]}
