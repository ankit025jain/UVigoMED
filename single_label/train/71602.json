{"id":71602,"title":"Melittin enhances radiosensitivity of hypoxic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by suppressing HIF-1?.","abstract":"Hypoxia is a widespread phenomenon present in many human solid tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis and therapy resistance. Here, we tested the feasibility of melittin, a major component of bee venom, on radiosensitization of hypoxic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). CNE-2 and KB cells were treated with melittin and radiation response was determined. Cell viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction were examined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1?) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins were assessed using western blotting. Additionally, we also examined the effect of melittin on tumor growth and radiosensitivity in vivo using a xenograft model of HNSCC. Treatment with melittin resulted in cell growth inhibition, induction of cell apoptosis, and reduction of HIF-1? and VEGF expression, which has been linked to hypoxia cell radioresistance. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of melittin significantly reduced the growth of HNSCC tumors in CNE-2 tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that melittin enhances radiosensitivity of HNSCC under hypoxia condition, and this is associated with the suppression of HIF-1? expression. Melittin appears to be a potential radiotherapy sensitization agent due to its significant antihypoxia activity.
