{"id":67390,"title":"[Relationship between urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse].","abstract":"Urinary incontinence affects up to 70% of women and pelvic organ prolapse has a prevalence of 41% in postmenopausal women over 60 years, but most are not clinically affected.Sought to assess the relationship of pelvic organ prolapse in patients with urinary incontinence diagnosed by urodynamic and which of the sub-types is related to a greater extent.We performed an observational, retrospective, descriptive, in which we reviewed records of patients with symptoms of urinary incontinence undergoing urodynamic study, evaluating a total of 85 patients.Prolapse was noted in mixed incontinence by 80%, compared to 46.9% with urge incontinence or stress incontinence 34.9%, p 0.034. 89.5% of women with prolapse had some form of incontinence, associated with an OR = 2.38 (CI 1844-3078, p = 0.023).","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620525","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.433997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.396419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.281731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.176249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.0639332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Stress incontinence","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_incontinence"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
