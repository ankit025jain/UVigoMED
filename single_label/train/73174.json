{"id":73174,"title":"Decreased VDR expression in cutaneous melanomas as marker of tumor progression: new data and analyses.","abstract":"Vitamin D3, acting via vitamin D receptor (VDR) affects a wide range of biological activities, including inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis, with net antitumor effects. VDR expression is disturbed in many tumors, including melanomas.To find correlation between VDR expression in melanomas and prognostic biomarkers.VDR was analyzed immunohistochemically in 69 cutaneous melanomas in relation to prognostic factors.Less advanced melanomas showed significantly higher VDR expression than the advanced stages. The presence of other markers such as ulceration and lack or non-brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was accompanied by significantly lower VDR expression. VDR expression also affected overall survival (OS) with most noticeable effect in the cases without ulceration.High VDR expression determines a less malignant phenotype and is related to better prognosis. Loss of VDR expression affects melanoma tumor behavior, allowing for progression of disease. VDR expression can also serve as a prognostic marker in routine histopathology evaluation.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922634","annotations":[{"name":"Calcitriol receptor","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol_receptor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.775663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.45775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.345619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
