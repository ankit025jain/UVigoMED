{"id":85776,"title":"Comparative study between Ephedra sinica Stapf and Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis on ET-1 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1? in rats with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in the effects of Ephedra sinica Stapf and Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis on angiogenesis in the treatment of bleomycin-induced rat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The rat models were created using bleomycin. The animals were divided into six groups: model, control, Ephedra alone, Schisandrae alone, combination of Ephedra and Schisandrae, and hydrocortisone alone. The treatments were administered for 28 days. After 7 and 28 days, the rats were sacrificed for pathological morphology examination, microvascular density determination, and angiogenesis-related cytokine examination. The Ephedra and hydrocortisone groups demonstrated significantly reduced alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis grades compared with the model group (P < 0.05). The number of blood vessels in the Ephedra group was higher than that in the Schisandrae and combination therapy groups. At 7 days, the expression level of endothelin (ET)-1 in the model group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (P < 0.01). The level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1? (6-keto-PGF1?) in the treatment group increased, and there were significant differences between the Ephedra group and the combination therapy and normal groups (P < 0.05). Ephedra inhibited the increase in the lung coefficient. The combination therapy prevented pulmonary artery injury and angiogenesis of the arteries by reducing the level of ET-1 and promoting the level of 6-keto-PGF1? in the blood. Ephedra and Schisandrae prevented alveolitis and the development of pulmonary fibrosis.
