{"id":44082,"title":"[Sanhuangyinchi decoction pretreatment ameliorates acute hepatic failure in rats by suppressing antioxidant stress and caspase-3 expression].","abstract":"To observe the effects of Sanhuangyinchi decoction (SHYCD) pretreatment on acute hepatic failure (AHF) induced by D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats and explore the possible mechanisms involving antioxidant stress and cell apoptosis-related protein expression.Forty-eight SD rats were randomized equally into control group, AHF model group, high-, medium- and low-dose SHYCD groups, and Bicyclol group. Five days after administration of the corresponding drugs, the rats were challenged with peritoneal D-galactosamine (700 mg/kg) plus LPS (10 ug/kg) injections to induce AHF acute hepatic failure except for those in the control group. At 48 h after the injections, blood samples were collected from the rats to detect the levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, PT, INR and FIB, and pathological changes and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the liver were examined; immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect caspase-3 protein expression in the liver.The levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, TP and INR in the 3 SHYCD groups and Bicyclol group significantly decreased (P<0.05) while FIB significantly increased in comparison with those in the model group. SHYCD obviously ameliorated the pathological changes, enhanced SOD activity (P<0.05), and decreased MDA levels (P<0.05) and caspase-3 expression (P<0.05) in the liver tissue. SHYCD at the medium dose produced similar effects to Bicyclol (P>0.05) and showed better effects at the high dose than Bicyclol (P<0.05).SHYCD pretreatment can dose-dependently ameliorate AHF in rats possibly by suppressing antioxidant stress and caspase-3 expression to decrease hepatic cell apoptosis.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752092","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.874168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.861423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.71519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.670267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.517935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.514674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.465204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.46082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.455775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.381416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.243394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","weight":0.0445468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_Dystrophy_Association"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
