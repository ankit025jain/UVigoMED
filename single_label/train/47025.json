{"id":47025,"title":"Prevalence of abnormal anal cytology and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions among a cohort of HIV-infected men who have sex with men.","abstract":"The incidence of anal cancer among HIV-infected patients is higher than that in other populations. Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions are considered precursors to invasive squamous-cell carcinomas and are strongly associated to high-risk human papillomavirus infection.The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions through screening based on cytology and high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy in a cohort of HIV-infected men who have sex with men.This investigation is an observational cross-sectional cohort study.The study was conducted in the HIV unit of a tertiary hospital in Spain.Three hundred HIV-infected men who have sex with men participated. Physical examination led to a diagnosis of perianal squamous-cell carcinoma and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 2 patients who were then excluded.Anal liquid cytology was performed. Patients with cytological abnormalities underwent high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy.The primary outcome measured was biopsy-proven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.The median age was 41 ± 10.5 years. The mean and nadir CD4 cell counts were 651 ± 205 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 438-800) and 273 ± 205 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range, 131-362). High-risk human papillomavirus was detected in 80.9% of patients, and human papillomavirus 16 was detected in 35.9% of patients. The mean number of human papillomavirus genotypes was 4.6 ± 2.9 (CI, 2-6). Anal cytology was abnormal in 40.9% of patients (n = 122/298; interquartile range, 35.4%-46.6%). High-resolution anoscopy and biopsies were performed in 119 patients. The results of histological analyses were as follows: normal, 7.7% (n = 23); condyloma, 4.3% (n = 13); anal intraepithelial neoplasia 1, 5.7% (n = 17); anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2, 14% (n = 42); and anal intraepithelial neoplasia 3, 8% (n = 24). The overall prevalence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions among patients with abnormal cytology was 54% (95% CI, 45.1%-62.8%). A diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was associated with human papillomavirus 16 and human papillomavirus 51 infection, and with detection of a higher number of human papillomavirus genotypes.High-resolution anoscopy was only performed in patients with abnormal cytology.The prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions is high in our cohort. Physical examination enabled straightforward diagnosis of perianal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous-cell carcinoma in 2 patients.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive
