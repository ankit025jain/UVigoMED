{"id":75065,"title":"Advances in epilepsy treatment: lacosamide pharmacokinetic profile.","abstract":"Lacosamide (LCM) is a functionalized amino acid specifically developed for use as an antiepileptic drug (AED) and is currently indicated as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adults with focal epilepsy (maximum approved dose 400Â mg/day). Characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile is an important aspect in the development of LCM. Studies in healthy subjects and in patients with focal epilepsy have established that LCM has several favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, including rapid absorption and high oral bioavailability not affected by food, linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, low inter- and intraindividual variability, low plasma protein binding, renal elimination, and a low potential for clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions both with AEDs and other common medications. Studies have demonstrated bioequivalence among the three LCM formulations (oral tablets, oral solution, and solution for intravenous (IV) infusion), allowing direct conversion to or from oral and IV administration without titration. Thus, the favorable and predictable pharmacokinetic profile and bioequivalence of LCM formulations, coupled with the low potential for clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, make LCM an easy-to-use adjunctive treatment for the management of patients with focal epilepsy.
