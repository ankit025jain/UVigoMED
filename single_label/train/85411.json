{"id":85411,"title":"Ratios of peripheral-to-central airway lumen area and percentage wall area as predictors of severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the ratios of peripheral-to-central airway lumen area (hereafter referred to as LA) and percentage wall area (hereafter referred to as %WA) to predict the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines.We examined 32 patients (27 men and five women; mean age ± SD, 70.0 ± 6.8 years; seven GOLD stage 0 [at risk for COPD], 19 GOLD stage 1-2 [mild to moderate airflow limitation], and six GOLD stage 3-4 [severe to very severe airflow limitation]) using inspiratory CT. Mean LA and %WA were measured for the first (main bronchi), third, and fifth generations of five bronchi in each lobe and the ratios of peripheral to central airways were calculated (third to first, fifth to first, and fifth to third) and statistically compared.The fifth-generation LA, LA fifth to first, and LA fifth to third significantly decreased and fifth %WA, %WA fifth to first, and %WA fifth to third also increased with progression of GOLD stage (p < 0.05), but central measurements, including first and third generations, did not. There were significant differences between GOLD 0 and GOLD 1-2 for %WA fifth to third and LA fifth to third and between GOLD 0 and GOLD 3-4 for all six parameters (p < 0.05); %WA fifth to third had the best cutoff value of 1.02 (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 86%) for diagnosis of COPD (GOLD 1-4). The %WA fifth to first of 1.51 (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 89%) was best for diagnosis of GOLD 3-4.Ratios of peripheral-to-central airway LA and %WA show improved correlation with COPD severity.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951198","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Bronchus","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.807293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.526802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.3449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.324274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.308448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.26108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Afterlife","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"GOLD (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOLD_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"2011 Giro d'Italia, Stage 12 to Stage 21","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Giro_d'Italia,_Stage_12_to_Stage_21"}]}
