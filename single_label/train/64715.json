{"id":64715,"title":"Tolerability during double-blind randomized phase I trials with the house dust mite allergy immunotherapy tablet in adults and children.","abstract":"The orodispersible house dust mite (HDM) sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablet (ALK, Denmark) is being developed for the treatment of HDM respiratory allergic disease. The objective of the 2 phase I trials was to investigate tolerability and the acceptable dose range of HDM SLIT-tablet treatment in adults and children with HDM respiratory allergic disease.The trials were randomized, multiple-dose, dose-escalation, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I trials including patients with HDM-induced asthma, with or without rhinoconjunctivitis. Both trials were registered in EudraCT (Trial 1: 2005-002151-41; Trial 2: 2007-000402-67). Trial 1 included 71 adults (18-63 years) and trial 2 included 72 children (5-14 years). Both trials included 6 dose groups that were randomized 3:1 to active treatment or placebo once daily for 28 days. Adverse events (AEs) were coded in MedDRA (version 8.1 or later). Immunological variables included specific IgE and IgE-blocking factor.No serious AEs were reported. In trial 1 (maximum dose, 32 development units [DU]), 1 patient in the 16 DU group discontinued due to AEs. The entire 32 DU group was discontinued as 1 patient had a severe adverse reaction. In trial 2 (maximum dose, 12 DU), no patients discontinued prematurely. The most frequently reported AEs were mild application-site related events. The total number of events was dose-related within each trial. HDM SLIT-tablet treatment induced changes in immunological parameters in a dose-dependent manner.These trials demonstrate that doses up to 12 DU of HDM SLIT-tablet were tolerated in the selected populations, and thus are suitable for further clinical investigations in adults and children with HDM respiratory allergic disease.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011352","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.722376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.633987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"House dust mite","weight":0.61259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.498523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.494004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Allergen immunotherapy","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.34563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.299239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"MedDRA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedDRA"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
