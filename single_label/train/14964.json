{"id":14964,"title":"Antioxidative and cardioprotective effects of total flavonoids extracted from Dracocephalum moldavica L. against acute ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury in isolated rat heart.","abstract":"This study evaluates antioxidative and cardioprotective effects of total flavonoids extracted from Dracocephalum moldavica L. (DML). The total flavonoids showed remarkable scavenging effects against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals in vitro. Compared with the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group as demonstrated by the use of improved Langendorff retrograde perfusion technology, the total flavonoids (5 ?g/mL) pretreatment improved the heart rate and coronary flow, rised left ventricular developed pressure and decreased creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase levels in coronary flow. The infarct size/ischemic area at risk of DML-treated hearts was smaller than that of I/R group; the superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio increased and malondialdehyde content reduced obviously (P < 0.01) in total flavonoids treatment groups. In conclusion, the total flavonoids possess obvious protective effects on myocardial I/R injury, which may be related to the improvement of myocardial oxidative stress states.
