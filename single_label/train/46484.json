{"id":46484,"title":"Controversies in the oncosurgical management of liver limited stage IV colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer diagnosis in the world (around 1.2 million diagnoses each year), and accounts for the second highest number of deaths. Over half of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases, with one quarter presenting in stage IV. There is growing evidence that patients with liver-limited disease represent a distinct biological cohort who will benefit from aggressive management. Only a minority of patients are technically resectable, but around 40% of patients with resected liver limited disease are alive 5 years after diagnosis compared with less than 1% for those with disseminated disease. Novel surgical techniques have been developed to allow more patients to undergo resection and there is also growing recognition that the chemotherapeutic manipulation of irresectable disease may bring some patients to resection with good long-term outcome. Perioperative chemotherapy can also improve long-term outcome through improved biological selection and destruction of occult micrometastases. This review outlines current oncosurgical treatment strategies for liver-limited stage IV colorectal cancer, and discusses some of the controversies surround the management of these complex patients.
