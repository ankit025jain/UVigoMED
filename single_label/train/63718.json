{"id":63718,"title":"[Lower risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients with transfusion dependent treated by dose-reduced decitabine].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose-reduced decitabine for the lower risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with transfusion dependent.Twenty-five cases of lower risk (low or intermediate-1 risk in IPSS risk group) MDS patients with transfusion dependence from November 2009 to September 2012 were treated by dose-reduced decitabine (20 mg/m(2) intravenously once daily for 3 days). And their efficacy, side effects, quality-of-life and survival rate were evaluated.Among them, the responses included complete remission (CR, n = 3, 12%), transfusion independence (n = 4, 16%), hematologic improvement (HI, n = 8, 32%) and stable disease (SD, n = 2, 8%). And the overall response rate (ORR) was 68% (17/25) . Among 11 cases available for cytogenetic evaluation, 1 achieved partial cytogenetic remission (PRc). IV grade hematologic toxicity rate was 48% (12/25) and III-IV grade infection rate 20% (5/25). No severe hematologic toxicity was observed. After treatment, the Karnofsky performance score (KPS) increased from 47 ± 16 to 66 ± 22 (P = 0.001); more patients were reclassified as WPSS ? 1 (44%vs 16%, P = 0.031) or MDACC score ? 7 (64% vs 8%, P = 0.022). The median follow-up time was 467(14-881) d. The 100 and 600-day expected survive rates of low and intermediate -1 risk in IPSS risk group were 100% versus 95.2% and 100% versus 90.5%.Dose-reduced decitabine is well-tolerated and effective in transfusion dependent MDS patients in IPSS-lower risk. There is a low rate of severe hematologic toxicity and early mortality. It may prolong their survival time.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405538","annotations":[{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.716721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.660855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.306224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.196465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Decitabine","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hawaii","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"1725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1725"},{"name":"1225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1225"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"The 100","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100"},{"name":"Office of Rail Regulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Rail_Regulation"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"}]}
