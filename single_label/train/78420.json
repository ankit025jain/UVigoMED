{"id":78420,"title":"[Vertigo from the practitioner's standpoint].","abstract":"One third of the population suffer from vertigo at some stage of their life. Some of its causes are harmless, some life-threatening, some will resolve spontaneously and some never. Vertigo is divided into four main types: vertigo, syncope, disturbance of balance and nonspecific vertigo. Medical history is the most important method of examination and leads to diagnosis in two out of three cases. Attempts are always made to provoke the sensation of vertigo and the possible nystagmus during the consultation. The success of the specific treatment in accordance with the primary cause determines the patient's prognosis.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673009","annotations":[{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.855469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.544713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.544115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Pathologic nystagmus","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_nystagmus"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.11105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
