{"id":68582,"title":"Anorectal manometry evaluation in adult women with clinical and urodynamic diagnostics of overactive bladder.","abstract":"Anorectal manometry is a diagnostic method often used in clinical practice for assessing functional anorectal disorders and pelvic floor. The dysfunctional voiding, anorectal and pelvic floor has been considered as contributing factors of the symptoms of overactive bladder.To evaluate the results with anorectal manometry in adult women with clinical and urodynamic diagnostics of overactive bladder.Twenty-five adult women (mean age 45.5 ± 11.9 years) with clinical and urodynamic diagnostic of overactive bladder underwent anorectal manometry and the results of this assessment were compared to a control group of eighteen women (mean age 33.9 ± 10.7 years) with no urinary or intestinal disorders and without clinical criteria for diagnosis of overactive bladder.Paradoxical puborectalis contraction occurred in six patients in the overactive bladder group and none of the controls. There were no significant between group differences in the following manometric parameters: rectoanal inhibitory reflex, rectal sensitivity, maximum tolerable volume, resting pressure, and hypertonia at rest. Mean squeeze pressure was 182.2 mmHg in the overactive bladder group versus 148.1 mmHg in the control group.Women with overactive bladder had increased incidence of paradoxical puborectalis contraction than women in the control group.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510035","annotations":[{"name":"Pelvic floor","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.560645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.533261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Hypertonia","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertonia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.411358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.389178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.267264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.196273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Puborectalis muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puborectalis_muscle"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Anorectal manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_manometry"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Barotrauma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotrauma"},{"name":"Chiropractic treatment techniques","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_treatment_techniques"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Pressure measurement","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement"}]}
