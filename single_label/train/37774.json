{"id":37774,"title":"Prospective evaluation of preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery followed by delayed resection of a high grade arteriovenous malformation.","abstract":"Reports of the utility of preoperative radiation for shrinking large arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in preparation for resection have produced conflicting results, and to our knowledge no prospective studies are available. A 28-year-old man presented with a ruptured right temporal Spetzler-Martin Grade 5 AVM with deep venous drainage, involvement of the internal capsule, deep perforator supply, and a diffuse nidus. He underwent staged embolization, a single Gamma Knife (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) radiation treatment to the deepest portion of the nidus followed by complete surgical resection 3 years later. He suffered no long-term neurological deficits and has since returned to work symptom-free (modified Rankin Scale score 0). Preoperative radiosurgery is an effective method for downgrading high-grade AVM in preparation for surgery by targeting the deeper portions that abut or involve eloquent territory. To our knowledge this is the first such successful prospective report in the literature.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472236","annotations":[{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.909087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Gamma Knife","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Knife"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Stockholm","weight":0.731343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm"},{"name":"Elekta","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elekta"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.595056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.352196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.334377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0857043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Internal capsule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_capsule"},{"name":"Knife","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
