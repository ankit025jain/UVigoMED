{"id":88774,"title":"7208 Victims of domestic and public violence; an exploratory study based on the reports of assaulted individuals reporting to the police.","abstract":"In this study, the data of 7208 victims (children and adults) of domestic and public violence were analysed after they reported this to the police in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In this analysis the characteristics of these intentional injuries were collected and compared. Despite some significant differences, there is no clear, specific way to distinguish between public and domestic violence. Therefore, it is more efficient for doctors to limit their focus to the differences between accidental and intentional injuries.
