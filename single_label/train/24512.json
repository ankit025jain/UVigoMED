{"id":24512,"title":"[Experience with Invirase as part of triple therapy as the drug of choice in the perinatal prevention of HIV transmission in the Ul'ianovsk Region].","abstract":"To retrospectively analyze the efficacy and safety of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (SQV) in the perinatal prevention of HIV infection in pregnant women in the Ulyanovsk Region.The outpatient cards of HIV-positive pregnant women who received ritonavir-boosted SQV in a dose of 1000/100 mg bid in combination with zidovudine or stavudine and lamivudine for the perinatal prevention of HIV infection in 2010-2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The main efficiency criterion was a proportion of children taken off a regular medical check-up in terms of perinatal contact as healthy at 18 months post-birth. The additional criteria (end points) were changes in viral load and CD4 cell count at 4 and 8-12 weeks after initiation of prevention.The analysis included data on 98 HIV-positive pregnant women. The history of HIV infection was 3 years or less in 63.2% of the patients. Stage 3 and 4A HIV infection was stated in 87 and 13% of the women, respectively. Treatment with ritonavir-boosted SQV + 2 nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors was started in 84.8% of the women at 15-28 weeks' gestation and in 12.2% of cases in earlier periods. Four weeks after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the viral load showed a 1-4 log10 decrease. By that time and at 8-12 weeks, it was undetectable (< 500 copies/ml) in 75 (76.5%) and 82 (83.6%) women, respectively. With a decrease in the viral load, CD4 cell count increased by 100-500 per mm3 (mean 160 per mm3). The efficiency of prevention of perinatal HIV transmission was 100%. No serious adverse events were observed.The use of ritonavir-boosted SQV in combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors is an effective and safe chemoprevention regimen for perinatal HIV transmission in pregnant women.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432594","annotations":[{"name":"Zidovudine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Saquinavir","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquinavir"},{"name":"Stavudine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavudine"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.743686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-transcriptase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.464959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
