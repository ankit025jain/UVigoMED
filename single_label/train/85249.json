{"id":85249,"title":"Nasal high-flow versus Venturi mask oxygen therapy after extubation. Effects on oxygenation, comfort, and clinical outcome.","abstract":"Oxygen is commonly administered after extubation. Although several devices are available, data about their clinical efficacy are scarce.To compare the effects of the Venturi mask and the nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy on PaO2/FiO2SET ratio after extubation. Secondary endpoints were to assess effects on patient discomfort, adverse events, and clinical outcomes.Randomized, controlled, open-label trial on 105 patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 300 immediately before extubation. The Venturi mask (n = 52) or NHF (n = 53) were applied for 48 hours postextubation.PaO2/FiO2SET, patient discomfort caused by the interface and by symptoms of airways dryness (on a 10-point numerical rating scale), interface displacements, oxygen desaturations, need for ventilator support, and reintubation were assessed up to 48 hours after extubation. From the 24th hour, PaO2/FiO2SET was higher with the NHF (287 ± 74 vs. 247 ± 81 at 24 h; P = 0.03). Discomfort related both to the interface and to airways dryness was better with NHF (respectively, 2.6 ± 2.2 vs. 5.1 ± 3.3 at 24 h, P = 0.006; 2.2 ± 1.8 vs. 3.7 ± 2.4 at 24 h, P = 0.002). Fewer patients had interface displacements (32% vs. 56%; P = 0.01), oxygen desaturations (40% vs. 75%; P < 0.001), required reintubation (4% vs. 21%; P = 0.01), or any form of ventilator support (7% vs. 35%; P < 0.001) in the NHF group.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003980","annotations":[{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.766946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.742331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.709617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.689504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.509082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.465467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.327906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.201595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"FiO2","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiO2"},{"name":"Venturi mask","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_mask"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Venturi effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_effect"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"National Housing Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Federation"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
