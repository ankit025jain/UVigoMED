{"id":77501,"title":"[Identification of occupational exposure in thoracic oncology: a Belgian experience].","abstract":"In Belgium in 2008, the body responsible for compensating and indemnifying victims of occupational diseases recognized 62 cases of lung cancer, although 702 cases were expected. There is an \"underreporting\" of occupational lung cancer. This study aimed to assess the number of cases of occupational lung cancer in a Belgian hospital specialized in oncology.From September 1st, 2009 to January 31st, 2011, each new patient with lung cancer has been directed to a consultation identifying occupational exposure to lung carcinogens.Among 81 occupational histories, 28 patients (35%) were found to have been definitely or probably exposed to one or more lung carcinogens (known or suspected). These patients were all male, mostly blue collar workers. Thirteen compensation claims for occupational disease have been introduced: nine recognized, one rejected and three pending.This study demonstrates the importance of a physician trained in occupational diseases within a thoracic oncology unit in reducing the \"underreporting\" of occupational lung cancer and thus providing the victims with the compensation to which they are legitimately due.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680113","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.734696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.63296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.604882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.488084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.370352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.190163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Blue-collar worker","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker"},{"name":"January 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_31"},{"name":"September 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"702 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/702_(band)"},{"name":"Collar (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(clothing)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Indemnity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
