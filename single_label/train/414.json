{"id":414,"title":"Detection of the frequency of PER-1 type extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates in Turkey: a multicenter study.","abstract":"?-Lactamases are an important resistance mechanism in Acinetobacter baumannii. Pseudomonas extended-resistance (PER-1) type ?-lactamase-producing strains have been reported from various geographic locations; however, PER-1 type ?-lactamases from Turkish hospitals have not been investigated extensively. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PER-1 type ?-lactamases in A. baumannii isolates in various regions of Turkey.A total of 763 clinical A. baumannii isolates were collected from 9 university hospitals and 2 state hospitals between 2008 and 2011. Molecular amplification of the OXA-51 gene from the A. baumannii genome was performed in order to verify identification of the species. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect blaPER-1 genes.PER-1 was detected in 24.6% of the isolates. The annual frequencies of the PER-1 enzyme were detected as 52.2%, 35.9%, and 8.3% in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. PER-1 prevalence decreased gradually over time. The differences observed in PER-1 prevalence among the regions of Turkey were statistically significant (chi-square test; P < 0.001).These data demonstrate that the frequency of detection of PER-1 type ?-lactamases in A. baumannii species has decreased in Turkey. However, the increased carbapenem resistance, together with multidrug resistance, has created a worrisome situation regarding this pathogen.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552158","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.797214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.445936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.292993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.195556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"University","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.0625932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Peru","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
