{"id":78264,"title":"Deaf and hard of hearing adolescents' processing of pictures and written words for taxonomic categories in a priming task of semantic categorization.","abstract":"Inspired by research by Li, Yi, and Kim (2011), the authors examined Chinese deaf and hard of hearing adolescents' responses to pictures for taxonomic categories of basic level (exemplar pictures) preceded by exemplar pictures, and to written words for taxonomic categories of basic level (exemplar words) preceded by exemplar words or by written words for those of superordinate level (category names), in a priming task of semantic categorization. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was manipulated. The adolescents were less aware of taxonomic relations and were more likely to show the advantage of pictures over written words than their hearing counterparts. Their processing of exemplar primes steadily deepened as SOA increased, reaching its deepest level when SOA was 237 ms. Their processing of category names seemed immune to changes in SOA, probably because of their fuzzy representations of taxonomic categories of superordinate level.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724307","annotations":[{"name":"Research","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.449993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.328859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.246599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.240104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Prime number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Computer data processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_processing"},{"name":"Fuzzy logic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic"},{"name":"Yi people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_people"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Exemplar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemplar"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Service-oriented architecture","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"},{"name":"Knowledge representation and reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Asynchrony","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony"},{"name":"Priming (psychology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)"}]}
