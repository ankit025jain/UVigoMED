{"id":89165,"title":"Flexion-adduction-external rotation method for shoulder dislocations.","abstract":"The aim of this prospective study was to assess the effectiveness of the flexion-adduction-external rotation method in the reduction of acute anterior shoulder dislocations.The study included 128 patients (98 male, 30 female; mean age: 33, range: 19 to 81) with a history of acute anterior shoulder dislocation treated with the flexion-adduction-external rotation method. Neurovascular examination was performed before and after reduction. Reduction duration and patient responses regarding the reduction method were recorded.First-time dislocation occurred in 92 patients and recurrent dislocation in 36. 111 patients had subcoracoid dislocations and 17 subglenoid dislocations. Fracture of the greater tubercle was present in 13 patients. Reduction was achieved in the first attempt in 104 patients and in the second in 12 patients. Mean reduction time was under 1.5 (range: 0 to 5) minutes. Reduction was unsuccessful in 12 patients and reduction under general anesthesia was performed. No patients experienced neurovascular injury after reduction.The forward flexion-adduction-external rotation method is an effective and comfortable reduction method for the treatment of shoulder dislocation or fracture-dislocation.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747624","annotations":[{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.506301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.270048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.204313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0549552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tubercle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercle"},{"name":"Greater tubercle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_tubercle"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
