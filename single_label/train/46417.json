{"id":46417,"title":"Glypican-3 as an emerging molecular target for hepatocellular carcinoma gene therapy.","abstract":"Glypican-3 (GPC-3), a membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan, plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and metastasis, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, and perhaps is a valuable target for its gene therapy. However, its mechanism remains to be explored. In the present study, the biological behaviors of HCC cells were investigated by interfering GPC-3 gene transcription. After the cells were transfected with specific GPC-3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), the inhibition of GPC-3 expression was 75.6 % in MHCC-97H or 73.8 % in Huh7 cells at mRNA level; the rates of proliferation and apoptosis were 53.6 and 60.5 % in MHCC-97H or 54.9 and 54.4 % in Huh7 cells, with the cell cycles arrested in the G1 phase; the incidences of cell migration, metastasis, and invasion inhibition were 80.1, 56.4, and 69.1 % in MHCC-97H or 80.9, 59.6, and 58.3 % in Huh7 cells, respectively. The cell biological behaviors were altered by silencing GPC-3 with down-regulation of ?-catenin, insulin-like growth factor-II and vascular endothelial growth factor, and Gli1 up-regulation. The cell proliferation was significantly inhibited (up to 95.11 %) by shRNA plus anti-cancer drugs, suggesting that GPC-3 gene should be a potential target for promoting hepatoma cell apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis through the Wnt/?-catenin and Hh singling pathways.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633918","annotations":[{"name":"Proteoglycan","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteoglycan"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Heparan sulfate","weight":0.842079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparan_sulfate"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.670714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.52267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.484022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.29557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.222407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.195799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"}]}
