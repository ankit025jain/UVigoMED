{"id":54001,"title":"Addition of insulin aspart with basal insulin is associated with improved glycemic control in Indian patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus: the A1chieve observational study.","abstract":"Insulin aspart (IAsp) has been used in patients for more than a decade. A plethora of data is available, from clinical trials, to document its efficacy and safety and suggest that IAsp is a favorable choice to be used in a basal-bolus regimen. The A1chieve@ was a non-interventional study that explored the safety and effectiveness of initiating or switching to insulin analogues in routine clinical practice in more than 60,000 patients from 28 different countries. In this manuscript, we discuss the findings from the subgroup of the Indian cohort who were treated with insulin aspart (IAsp), in addition to a basal insulin analogue (insulin detemir, IDet). In a cohort of 343, who were on IAsp + IDet, 175 (51%) were insulin naive and 168 (49%) had been on insulin therapy earlier. Glycaemic parameters were high at baseline. Mean HbA1c was 9.3% in them and was comparable in both insulin naive and insulin experienced groups. After 24 weeks of therapy with IAsp + basal insulin, there were reductions in HbA1c in both the insulin naive group, (-1.6) and insulin experienced group (-1.5). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels were also reduced significantly from baseline (-77 and - 110 mg/dL, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, hypoglycaemia decreased from 0.97 (baseline) to 0.18 events/patient years (24 weeks). There was also an increase in quality of life score as evaluated by EQ-5D questionnaire. Addition of IAsp with a basal insulin in patients with poor glycaemic control leads to an improvement in glycaemic profile with no major hypoglycaemia or clinically significant weight gain along with an improvement in the quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482984","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin detemir","weight":0.84052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_detemir"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Insulin analog","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_analog"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Basal rate","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.668405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.655844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Insulin aspart","weight":0.646624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_aspart"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.637676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.469926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.407543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.327877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.286179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
