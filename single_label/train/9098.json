{"id":9098,"title":"Divergent CD4+ T memory stem cell dynamics in pathogenic and nonpathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus infections.","abstract":"Recent studies have identified a subset of memory T cells with stem cell-like properties (T(SCM)) that include increased longevity and proliferative potential. In this study, we examined the dynamics of CD4(+) T(SCM) during pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus macaques (RM) and nonpathogenic SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SM). Whereas SIV-infected RM show selective numeric preservation of CD4(+) T(SCM), SIV infection induced a complex perturbation of these cells defined by depletion of CD4(+)CCR5(+) T(SCM), increased rates of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation, and high levels of direct virus infection. The increased rates of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation in SIV-infected RM correlated inversely with the levels of central memory CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, nonpathogenic SIV infection of SM evidenced preservation of both CD4(+) T(SCM) and CD4(+) central memory T cells, with normal levels of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation, and lack of selective depletion of CD4(+)CCR5(+) T(SCM). Importantly, SIV DNA was below the detectable limit in CD4(+) T(SCM) from 8 of 10 SIV-infected SM. We propose that increased proliferation and infection of CD4(+) T(SCM) may contribute to the pathogenesis of SIV infection in RM.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729621","annotations":[{"name":"Simian immunodeficiency virus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus"},{"name":"CCR5","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.810292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rhesus macaque","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.716845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Simian","weight":0.681032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.173628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.154871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Sooty mangabey","weight":0.0972222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_mangabey"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Longevity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"}]}
