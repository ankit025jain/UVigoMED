{"id":61109,"title":"[Correlation analysis of FPGS rs10760502G>a polymorphism with prognosis and MTX-related toxicity in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia].","abstract":"This study was aimed to explore the relation between folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) rs10760502 polymorphism and prognosis and methotrexate (MTX)-related toxicities in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Sequenom MassARRAY was used to genotype rs10760502. The ?(2) test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used to analyze the data. The results indicated that A allele carriers (GA+AA) had poor relapse free survival (RFS, log-rank: P = 0.004) and event free survival (EFS, log-rank: P = 0.022) compared with the GG genotype carriers. Multivariate Cox-regression analysis results showed that A allele is an independent prognosis factor for poor RFS [hazard ratio (HR), 20.173; 95% CI, 2.535-160.545; P = 0.005] and EFS (HR, 8.133; 95% CI, 1.718-38.512; P = 0.008). No relationship was found between any MTX toxicity and rs10760502 polymorphism. It is concluded that FPGS rs10760502G>A polymorphism may affect the treatment outcome of B-ALL patients.
