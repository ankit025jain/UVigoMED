{"id":34931,"title":"Persistence of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common illness of childhood.To evaluate the natural history of AD and determine the persistence of symptoms over time.A cross-sectional and cohort study of a nation-wide long-term registry of children with AD enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER).Self-reported outcome of whether a child's skin was AD symptom-free for 6 months at 6-month intervals.A total of 7157 patients were enrolled in the PEER study for a total of 22,550 person-years. At least 2 years of follow-up were observed for 4248 children and at least 5 years of follow-up were observed for 2416 children. Multiple demographic and exposure variables were associated with more persistent AD. At every age (ie, 2-26 years), more than 80% of PEER participants had symptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. It was not until age 20 years that 50% of patients had at least 1 lifetime 6-month symptom- and treatment-free period.Based on this large longitudinal cohort study, symptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of a child's life and likely longer. Atopic dermatitis is probably a life-long illness.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696036","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.462371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.308691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.0588889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.0173167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Employees_for_Environmental_Responsibility"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
