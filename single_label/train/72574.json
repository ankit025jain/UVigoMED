{"id":72574,"title":"The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations of triple-negative breast cancer patients in Xinjiang multiple ethnic region of China.","abstract":"The screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is now an established component of risk evaluation and management of familial breast cancer, early-onset breast cancer and bilateral breast cancer patients. There is still some controversy about whether this screening should be done in triple-negative breast cancers. Therefore, we evaluated the BRCA mutation prevalence in patients with triple-negative breast cancer in a multi-ethnic region of China.A total 96 women who were diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in the Xinjiang region of China were enrolled in this study. BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening was performed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) sequencing analysis. All mutations were confirmed with direct sequencing.The prevalence of a BRCA1/2 germline mutation was about 25% (24/96) in the Xinjiang region of China. Among 35 selected cases with a family history and/or bilateral breast cancers, the BRCA1/2 mutation prevalence was 25.7% (9/35). Of the remaining 61 patients with unselected triple-negative breast cancer, the BRCA1/2 mutation prevalence was 24.6% (15/61), and all 15 individuals with these mutations were premenopausal patients.These results suggest that premenopausal women with triple-negative breast cancer may be candidates for genetic testing for BRCA1/2 in the Xinjiang region of China, even in the absence of a family history or bilateral breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961674","annotations":[{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.914023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"BRCA2","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA2"},{"name":"Germline mutation","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.671318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.56273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"BRCA mutation","weight":0.530374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation"},{"name":"China","weight":0.503888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Xinjiang","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.34551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.120689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0918536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0459474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
