{"id":35999,"title":"Risk of late-preterm stillbirth and neonatal morbidity for monochorionic and dichorionic twins.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the prospective risk of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) at ?34 weeks' gestation for monochorionic and dichorionic twins receiving intensive antenatal fetal surveillance. The secondary objective was to calculate the incidence of prematurity-related neonatal morbidity/mortality rates that have been stratified by gestational week and chorionicity.A retrospective cohort study of all twins at ?34 weeks' gestation who were delivered at the Medical University of South Carolina (1987-2010) was performed. Twins were cared for in a longstanding Twin Clinic with standardized treatment and surveillance protocols and supervised by a consistent Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist. Gestational age-specific fetal/neonatal mortality rates and composite neonatal morbidity rates were compared by chorionicity. A generalized linear mixed model was used to identify variables that were associated with increased composite neonatal morbidity.Among 768 twin gestations (601 dichorionic and 167 monochorionic), only 1 dichorionic IUFD occurred. The prospective risk of IUFD at ?34 weeks' gestation was 0.17% for dichorionic twins and 0% for monochorionic twins. Composite neonatal morbidity decreased with each gestational week (P < .0001). Morbidity was increased by white race, gestational diabetes mellitus, and elective indication for delivery. The nadir of composite neonatal morbidity occurred at 36/0-36/6 weeks' gestation for monochorionic twins and 37/0-37/6 weeks' gestation for dichorionic twins.Our data do not support concern for an increased risk of stillbirth in uncomplicated intensively monitored monochorionic twins at ?34 weeks' gestation. However, our data do show significantly increased rates of neonatal morbidity in late preterm monochorionic twins that cannot be justified by a corresponding reduction in the risk of stillbirth. We believe that our data support delivery of uncomplicated monochorionic twins at 37 weeks' gestation.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607757","annotations":[{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Stillbirth","weight":0.818034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.777552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.761319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.644811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.2707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Chorion","weight":0.160732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorion"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Pregnancy (mammals)","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_(mammals)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"University of South Carolina","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina"},{"name":"Monochorionic twins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochorionic_twins"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
