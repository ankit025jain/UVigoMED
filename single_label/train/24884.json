{"id":24884,"title":"[Study on preventive and therapeutic effects of combined application of yindanxinnaotong soft capsule and exercise on atherosclerotic rats].","abstract":"To explore the prevention effect of the joint combination of Yindanxinnaotong soft capsule (YDXNT) and exercise (swimming) on atherosclerotic rats. The method of 3 x 3 factorial design, including two factors (YDXNT and swimming) and three levels (0, 1, 2 g x kg(-1) YDXNT; 0, 0.5, 1 h swimming), was mainly adopted. The atherosclerotic rat model was established by ligating their left common carotid arteries and feeding high-fat diet. After 8 weeks, blood samples were collected from their thoracic aorta to determine blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, fibrinogen (FIB), nitric oxide (NO), 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) endothelin (ET) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2). The tissues of left common carotid arteries of the rats were collected to detect the positive expression of SM22alpha and determine the semi-quantitation through the immunohistochemical staining. The result showed that the combination of YDXNT and swimming can significantly decrease the plasma viscosity (F = 3.241, P = 0.017), the high and low shear blood viscosity (F = 6.444, P = 0.001; F = 3.002, P = 0.024) and FIB (F = 4.046, P = 0.005). The increased NO and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and the decreased ET and TXB2 indicated a significant interaction (P < 0.05). The swimming showed an obvious main effect in the expression of up-regulated protein SM22alpha (F = 8.088, P = 0.001). The study suggested that the combined administration of YDXNT and swimming could improve the hemorheological parameters of atherosclerotic rats, protect the vascular endothelium, inhibit the vascular remodeling in atherosclerosis and positively prevent the atherosclerosis.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276980","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.910201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.684215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.683353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Thromboxane","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboxane"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.663739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.65693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.647034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood viscosity","weight":0.614744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_viscosity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.501426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.173608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.164056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.153709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Thoracic aorta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_aorta"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"}]}
