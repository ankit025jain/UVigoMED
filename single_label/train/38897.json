{"id":38897,"title":"Adherence to medical treatment in inflammatory bowel disease patients.","abstract":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic intestinal conditions characterized by unpredictable course, with periods of flare-ups and remissions suggesting poor adherence to medical therapy. On the other hand adherence is one of the most common reason of failure in the treatment of chronic disease.We have analyzed IBD patients' questionnaires, sent by IBD Society of Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy). The anonymous questionnaire included sex, age, qualification, management, disease duration, disease associated, previous surgery, use of homeopathy and self-medication and possible psychological support. We classified patients based on IBD type: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).A total of 559 IBD patients were analysed (50.1% female), 52.8% were affected by CD. Patients were followed by gastroenterologist in 84.7% of cases. 17.4% of patient reported non-adherence to medical therapy; univariate analysis showed that non-adherence was more frequent in young females followed-up by general practitioners, no difference was found in educational status or type of IBD. Factors independently associated with greater adherence to medical therapy were age (OR=2.039) and follow-up by gastroenterologist (OR=3.025).Non-adherence should be taken into account in IBD patients and especially in young female. Gastroenterologists have a major role in promoting education.","date":"2014-11-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25384805","annotations":[{"name":"Homeopathy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.762848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.740266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.580601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.329879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.198135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Psychiatric rehabilitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
