{"id":24793,"title":"[Influence of low birth weight on the increased risk of post-partum hypertension].","abstract":"To compare the prevalence of hypertension between low birth weight infant (LBWI) women and non-LBWI women.A retrospective cohort study was applied and 3 172 pregnant women giving births during October 1976 to December 2008 in our hospital and underwent physical check-up between 2010 and 2011 at the Kailuan medical group were included and divided into LBWI group and non-LBWI group by the history of LBWI. Prevalence of hypertension was obtained during the follow-up program. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relative risk of hypertension.A total number of 3 172 women, with an average age of 42.3 years old were divided into LBWI group (n = 147) and non-LBWI group (n = 3 025), with the average birth weights of their infants were 2.31 kg and 3.39 kg, respectively. The prevalence of hypertension from the follow-up program was significantly higher in LBWI group than that in the non-LBWI group (23.8% vs. 16.9%, P < 0.05). After adjustment for other traditional risk factors, the risk of hypertension in LBWI group was 1.60 (95%CI:1.02-2.53) folds higher than that in the non-LBWI group.Prevalence of hypertension in women with LBWI was higher than that in those women without LBWI. History of LBWI seemed to have had an increased risk to develop hypertension.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294065","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.534575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.532968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.520226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.50668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.474518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.459674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.408015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.309086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1976","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"}]}
