{"id":20798,"title":"mga genosensor for early detection of human rheumatic heart disease.","abstract":"The 5' amino-labeled DNA probe complementary to mga gene of Streptococcus pyogenes was immobilized on carboxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes electrode and hybridized with 0.1-100 ng/6 ?l single-stranded genomic DNA (ssG-DNA) of S. pyogenes from throat swab of suspected rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients. Electrochemical response was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance (EI). The sensitivity of the sensor was 106.03?(?A/cm(2))/ng and limit of detection (LOD) was found 0.014 ng/6 ?l with regression coefficient (R(2)) of 0.921 using DPV. The genosensor was characterized by FTIR and SEM, and electrode was found stable for 6 months on storage at 4 Â°C with 5-6 % loss in initial DPV current. mga genosensor is the first report on RHD sensor which can save life of several suspected patients by early diagnosis in 30 min.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639090","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.936098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Carbon nanotube","weight":0.716893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.654904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.644708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Electrochemistry","weight":0.49684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry"},{"name":"Rheumatic fever","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.382867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.311485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.140999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.0428226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Cyclic voltammetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Voltammetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltammetry"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Streptococcus pyogenes","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pyogenes"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Complementarity (molecular biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)"}]}
