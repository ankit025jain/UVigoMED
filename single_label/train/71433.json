{"id":71433,"title":"Supportive care considerations for older adults with cancer.","abstract":"The treatment of cancer presents specific concerns that are unique to the growing demographic of elderly patients. Because the incidence of cancer is strongly correlated with aging, the expansion of supportive care and other age-appropriate therapies will be of great importance as the population of elderly patients with cancer increases in the coming years. Elderly patients are especially likely to experience febrile neutropenia, complications from chemotherapy-induced nausea, anemia, osteoporosis (especially in patients diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer), depression, insomnia, and fatigue. These issues are often complicated by other chronic conditions related to age, such as diabetes and cardiac disease. For many patients, symptoms may be addressed both through lifestyle management and pharmaceutical approaches. Therefore, the key to improving quality of life for the elderly patient with cancer is an awareness of their specific needs and a familiarity with emergent treatment options.
