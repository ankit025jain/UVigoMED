{"id":79650,"title":"[Investigation on common human soil-transmitted nematode infections in Quanzhou City in 2012].","abstract":"To understand the epidemic situation of common human soil-transmitted nematode infections in Quanzhou City in 2012, so as to provide the evidence for improving the prevention and control measures.The residents aged above 3 years from 5 townships in 2 counties were investigated to detect the parasite eggs (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura) by Kato-Katz technique. One kindergarten of each county was randomly selected and 228 children were investigated to detect Enterubius vermicularis eggs by the cellophane tape anus test.The total hookworm infection rate was 3.60% (69/1919). For the hookworm infection rates, there was no significant difference among different areas and between different genders, but there were significant differences among different age groups and different careers. No Enterubius vermicularis eggs were detected.The effect of the prevention and control of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura and Enterubius vermicularis infections is remarkable. However, the infection rate of hookworm has a rising trend and the prevention and control of hookworm infection should be strengthened.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051850","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.566181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.468687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.438701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Trichinosis","weight":0.249642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.246849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Kindergarten","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cellophane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane"},{"name":"Civil township","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township"},{"name":"Quanzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"}]}
