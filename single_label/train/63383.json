{"id":63383,"title":"[Coagulation disorders in the context of cardiac surgery - Clinical basics and mechanism based therapy].","abstract":"Intra- and postoperative bleeding disorders are common in cardiac surgery. The etiology of perioperative coagulopathy frequently becomes apparent as a combination of several acquired and inherited disorders. Differential diagnosis of microvascular bleeding include altered homeostasis (e.g. anemia, hypothermia, acidosis, hypocalcemia), impaired primary hemostasis, antithrombotic medication, dilutive and consumptive coagulopathy, fibrinolysis and the absence or deficiency of coagulation factors. Timely detection of underlying pathology and subsequent rigorous treatment has the potential to minimize perioperative transfusion requirements, prevent resternotomy and improve patient outcome remarkably. Point-of-care-systems can provide fast bed-sided analysis, which contribute to early diagnosis and intervention. Individual and regularly revised algorithms, adapted to the individualized institutional infrastructure, may facilitate resource-saving treatment of perioperative coagulopathy.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446009","annotations":[{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.870827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypocalcaemia","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcaemia"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.780391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.755978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.348044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"}]}
