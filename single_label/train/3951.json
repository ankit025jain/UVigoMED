{"id":3951,"title":"Signal decomposition for X-ray dark-field imaging.","abstract":"Grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging is a new imaging modality. It allows the visualization of structures at micrometer scale due to small-angle scattering of the X-ray beam. However, reading darkfield images is challenging as absorption and edge-diffraction effects also contribute to the dark-field signal, without adding diagnostic value. In this paper, we present a novel--and to our knowledge the first--algorithm for isolating small-angle scattering in dark-field images, which greatly improves their interpretability. To this end, our algorithm utilizes the information available from the absorption and differential phase images to identify clinically irrelevant contributions to the dark-field image. Experimental results on phantom and ex-vivo breast data promise a greatly enhanced diagnostic value of dark-field images.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333115","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.750095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.454175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Micrometre","weight":0.421251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre"},{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.148686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Visualization (computer graphics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Dark field microscopy","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_field_microscopy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"Isolating language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Differential phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_phase"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Interpretability","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretability"}]}
