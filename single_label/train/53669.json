{"id":53669,"title":"The role of miR-200a in vasculogenic mimicry and its clinical significance in ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) indicates that aggressive cancer cells can form de novo vascular networks and provide a perfusion pathway for rapidly growing tumors. MiR-200a has been reported significantly deregulated in ovarian cancer. However, miR-200a regulation of VM and its clinical significance in ovarian cancer remain not elucidated.In this study, we identified the VM structure by CD34-PAS staining in ovarian cancer tissue. MiR-200a and protein expression was tested by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Bioinformatics prediction, luciferase assay and intervention experiments were employed to identify the target of miR-200a.We certified the VM structure in ovarian cancer, and found that the VM positive rate was significantly associated with tumor grade, stage and metastasis. Further study showed that miR-200a expression levels were significantly lower in VM positive ovarian cancer. In addition, our results suggested that miR-200a inhibited VM by negatively regulated EphA2 expression. Consistently, the inverse correlation of miR-200a and EphA2 has also been found in ovarian cancer patients. Moreover, the expression of miR-200a/EphA2 was significantly associated with patient's clinicopathological parameter, such as tumor stage and metastases. Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that the patients with low miR-200a expression and/or VM positive had a significantly shorter overall survival.Our research demonstrates that VM, miR-200a and EphA2 play key roles in the progression and prognosis of ovarian cancer, and for the first time suggests that miR-200a inhibits VM by directly regulating EphA2. Therefore, we might have identified a genetic mechanism underlying the involvement of miR-200a in ovarian cancer VM.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System
