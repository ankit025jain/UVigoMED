{"id":51985,"title":"[Follow-up and management of children born small for gestational age a endocrine and metabolic aspects].","abstract":"Children born premature and/or small for gestational age (SGA) are at risk of growth and metabolic abnormalities. Catch-up growth occurs usually before the age of 2. In the absence of sufficient catch up growth, growth hormone (GH) treatment should be evaluated under certain conditions. Children who were born premature and/or SGA are at higher risk of insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities, especially in case of excessive weight gain during the first months of life. Puberty in these children occurs normally or slightly advanced, with no effect on gonadic function or fertility. Each step of the development of premature and/or SGA children present specific risks, which the pediatrician has to follow. If necessary, the pediatric endocrinologist will initiate a specific management.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640277","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Pediatric endocrinology","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_endocrinology"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.636657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.503397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Small for gestational age","weight":0.253699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_for_gestational_age"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Caught","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
