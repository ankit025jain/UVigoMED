{"id":76030,"title":"Factors influencing elevated serum apolipoprotein B48 in diabetic and control participants.","abstract":"Factors influencing the concentration of apolipoprotein B48 (apo B48) at fasting and post-prandial time frames are still being elucidated. This study assesses some possible contributing factors including the presence of type 2 diabetes and gender using an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Apo B48 and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured before and for two, four and six hours post-prandially in 49 poorly controlled participants with type 2 diabetes and in 60 apparently healthy participants (controls). Apo B48 levels in the control participants increased post-prandially, peaking at four hours (14.81 ± 7.72 ?g/mL) with similar responses demonstrated in TG concentrations. Post-prandial apo B48 levels were significantly higher in male control participants as demonstrated by apo B48 area under the curve (AUC); similar responses were also confirmed in triglyceride AUC. Post-prandial apo B48 concentrations in control participants correlated with HOMA-IR (P < 0.05). Apo B48 continued to increase throughout the six hours in participants with type 2 diabetes (17.73 ± 13.46 ?g/mL), when levels were significantly greater than in the control participants (13.04 ± 7.67 ?g/mL) (P < 0.05) despite a decrease in accompanying TG levels in participants with type 2 diabetes. Using an ELISA method, this study demonstrated that gender, insulin resistance (as evidenced by HOMA-IR) and diabetes status influence serum apo B48 levels. These effects were only apparent post-prandially.","date":"2015-01-07","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562991","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.745098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.619196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.571318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.470977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.445852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.398945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein B","weight":0.37889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_B"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lorimer Street Line","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorimer_Street_Line"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Aban","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aban"},{"name":"Pipeline forwarding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_forwarding"},{"name":"Transgender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
