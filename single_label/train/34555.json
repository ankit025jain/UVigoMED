{"id":34555,"title":"Reoperation for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after repair of atrioventricular septal.","abstract":"Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is an important source of morbidity and mortality after repair of atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD). The intrinsic anatomy of the left ventricular outflow tract in AVSD is complex and predisposes to the development of LVOTO. LVOTO after repair of AVSD usually involves multiple levels and sources of obstruction, and surgical intervention must address each component of the obstruction. This includes fibromuscular obstruction, septal hypertrophy, and valve related sources of obstruction. Special attention is also directed to the anterolateral muscle bundle of the left ventricle, a well defined but under recognized feature of the left ventricular outflow tract in AVSD. It is present in all patients with AVSD, and resection of a hypertrophic anterolateral muscle bundle of the left ventricle should be incorporated in all operations for LVOTO after repair of AVSD. LVOTO after repair of AVSD has several unique features that must be taken into consideration to maximize outcome after surgical intervention. These include anatomic factors, technical aspects of surgical intervention, and proper selection of the operation used for relief of LVOTO.
