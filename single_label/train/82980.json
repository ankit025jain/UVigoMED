{"id":82980,"title":"Ability of barrier coat S-PRG coating to arrest artificial enamel lesions in primary teeth.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of a surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) filled coating material to arrest artificial enamel lesions in primary teeth.Buccal and lingual enamel was demineralized in 0.1 M lactic acid buffer solution (pH 4.75) for 5 days and then divided in the PRG-applied and non-PRG areas. Proximal surfaces were used as a control area without demineralization and coating application. Teeth were divided into three groups (n = 4) according to the 1-week immersion in different solutions: Group 1 (distilled water), Group 2 (demineralizing solution) and Group 3 (artificial saliva). Hardness and Young's modulus by nano-indentation test, and elemental contents and ultrastructure by SEM/EDX analysis were obtained. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD at alpha = 0.05.Only for the non-PRG area in Group 1, the hardness and Young's modulus of the demineralized surface enamel were significantly lower than those of the enamel 30-60 microm beneath the surface. Demineralized enamel of non-PRG and PRG-applied areas showed similar SEM views. Only for the non-PRG area in Group 2 and control area in Group 3, the Ca/P of the surface enamel was significantly higher than that of the enamel 5-10 microm beneath the surface. There was no significant difference of the Ca/P among the measuring points from the surface to 10 microm depth of enamel for the PRG applied area in Group 2.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479282","annotations":[{"name":"Young's modulus","weight":0.896099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.822632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.6385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.607489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Buffering agent","weight":0.568265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffering_agent"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.495931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.33373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.32868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.174834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0416485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Nanoindentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoindentation"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Radical Party of the Left","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Party_of_the_Left"},{"name":"Control Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Area"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
