{"id":72219,"title":"[Comparison and analysis of SNV results: detected by transcriptome sequencing technology on initial diagnosis and remission stage of a patient with AML-M2].","abstract":"This study was aimed to further clarify the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia(AML), and to forecast new somatic mutations related with leukemia. The peripheral blood samples on initial diagnosis and remission stage of a patient with partial differentiated AML(AML-M2) were sequenced by high throughput transcriptome sequencing technology. The single nucleotide variation (SNV) which possibly related with pathogenesis of leukemia was screened through comparison of the expressed genes on initial diagnosis and after remission. The results showed that the Reads distributed uniformly in genome and covered completely, detecting most expression genes. by screening the SNV, a total of 29881 mutations were discovered, including 28113 germline mutations and 752 individual mutations. Among them, 11 acquired mutations (P < 0.05) in coding regions were got, including ZRSR1, MLXIP, TLN1, LAP3, HK3. It is concluded that the high throughput sequencing as an unbiased new method can find new tumor-related mutations. MLXIP may be a new molecular marker of AML-M2.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989273","annotations":[{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.53784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Molecular marker","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_marker"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.299501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"High-throughput screening","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Hong Kong dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_dollar"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"}]}
