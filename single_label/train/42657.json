{"id":42657,"title":"Enhanced antitumor immunity is elicited by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of CCL21 and IL-15 in murine colon carcinomas.","abstract":"The chemokine CCL21 is a potent chemoattractant for T cells and dendritic cells. IL-15 elicits powerful antitumor immune responses through the stimulation of natural killer cells. We constructed a CCL21/IL-15-expressing adenovirus (Ad-CCL21-IL-15) and evaluated its antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. We found that the intratumoral injection of Ad-CCL21-IL-15 into murine colon carcinomas significantly inhibited tumor growth. Splenocytes from mice treated with Ad-CCL21-IL-15 developed tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells and were protected from subsequent challenges with tumor cells. This study indicates that providing cancer therapy by combining CCL21 and IL-15 can induce antitumor immune responses and is an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy.
