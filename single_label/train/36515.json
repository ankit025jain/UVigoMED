{"id":36515,"title":"A novel recessive mutation in the gene ELOVL4 causes a neuro-ichthyotic disorder with variable expressivity.","abstract":"A rare neuro-ichthyotic disorder characterized by ichthyosis, spastic quadriplegia and intellectual disability and caused by recessive mutations in ELOVL4, encoding elongase-4 protein has recently been described. The objective of the study was to search for sequence variants in the gene ELOVL4 in three affected individuals of a consanguineous Pakistani family exhibiting features of neuro-ichthyotic disorder.Linkage in the family was searched by genotyping microsatellite markers linked to the gene ELOVL4, mapped at chromosome 6p14.1. Exons and splice junction sites of the gene ELOVL4 were polymerase chain reaction amplified and sequenced in an automated DNA sequencer.DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation (c.78C > G; p.Tyr26*).Our report further confirms the recently described ELOVL4-related neuro-ichthyosis and shows that the neurological phenotype can be absent in some individuals.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571530","annotations":[{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.881166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.808841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Consanguinity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consanguinity"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Ichthyosis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.767924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.723806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Chromosome 6 (human)","weight":0.721968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_6_(human)"},{"name":"Expressivity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.664069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.621748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.427706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.416339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.34266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.313774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.235123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"P14arf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P14arf"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"}]}
