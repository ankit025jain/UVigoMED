Questionnairing was conducted among students of grades 3 and 4 from the Central Primary School, Liyuzhou Primary School, and Meichi Primary School in Wuxing Farm of Nanchang City in June 2010. Eighty-four students from Central Primary School were selected as experiment group, and 62 students in the other two schools served as control group. Health education intervention (knowledge lectures, information dissemination, intensive education and so on) was conducted for the students in experiment group from September 2010 to October 2011. Final KAP questionnaire survey was carried out after intervention. A KAP hierarchical evaluation method was used to calculate the KAP scores in the two groups before and after intervention.After health education, the total KAP score in experiment group increased from 8.40 before education to 9.36 (t = 2.994 4, P < 0.01), higher than that of the control (8.53, t = 5.335 5, P < 0.01). The scores of knowledge, attitude and behavior of schistosomiasis control increased from 6.16, 9.10, and 8.67 before education to 8.12, 9.86, and 9.45 after education in experiment group (t = 5.716 8, P < 0.01; t = 3.2764, P < 0.01; t = 3.276 4, P < 0.01), respectively. Compared to the experiment group, after health education the scores of knowledge (6.34, t = 3.517 5, P < 0.01) and attitude of schistosomiasis control (9.43, t = 2.311 9, P < 0.05) were lower in control group; but no significant difference was found on the score of behavior between the two groups. After health education, the scores of 26 indices in experiment group were higher than that of the control and before education.The health education intervention is effective for schistosomiasis control in the experiment school.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818398","annotations":[{"name":"Information","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.690164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"School","weight":0.676438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.515013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.501607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.495077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.388198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.335087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.272304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.196588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Nanchang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanchang"},{"name":"Poyang Lake","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poyang_Lake"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"716","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/716"},{"name":"994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/994"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"335","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"311 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/311_(band)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Primary schools in Watford","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_schools_in_Watford"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"}]}
