{"id":42727,"title":"Transanal minimally invasive surgery for benign and malignant rectal neoplasia.","abstract":"Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS), an alternative technique to transanal endoscopic microsurgery, was developed in 2009. Herein, we describe our initial experience using TAMIS for benign and malignant rectal neoplasia.This is an institutional review board approved, retrospective case series report.TAMIS was performed in 32 patients for rectal adenoma (13), adenocarcinoma (16), and carcinoid (3). There were 14 women, with mean age 62 ± 15 years and body mass index 28 ± 5 kg/m(2). Lesion size ranged from .5 to 8.5 cm, distance from the dentate line 1 to 11 cm, and circumference of the lesion 10% to 100%. The mean operative time was 123 ± 62 minutes. Mean hospital length of stay was 2.5 ± 2 days. Complications included urinary tract infection (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhea (1), atrial fibrillation (1), rectal stenosis (1), and rectal bleeding (1).TAMIS using a disposable transanal access platform is a safe and effective method to remove rectal lesions in this case series.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832238","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.903253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Carcinoid","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoid"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.771311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Lower gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.387197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.344836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.296439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
