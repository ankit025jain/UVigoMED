{"id":46668,"title":"Clinical features of elderly Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis.","abstract":"To study the clinical features of elderly Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis.The clinical features of 36 patients diagnosed at age >60 years were compared with those of 39 patients aged <50 years.The M:F ratio was 1:35 (>60 years) vs. 3:36 (<50 years). The patients >60 years had a higher frequency of cirrhosis at presentation than the patients <50 years (52.8% vs. 15.4%, p=0.001). The patients >60 years also had a significantly increased incidence of ascites at presentation (41.7% vs. 10.3%, p=0.001) and lower serum albumin levels (p=0.037). There were significant differences between older and younger patients with respect to the frequencies or titers of anti-nuclear antibody (46.2% vs. 83.3%, p=0.011). HLA DR3 positivity occurred more frequently in the patients <50 years than in those >60 years (59.0% vs. 19.4%, p<0.001), whereas HLA DR4 occurred more often in the patients >60 years (63.9% vs. 25.6%, p=0.001). Treatment failure occurred more frequently in the patients <50 years (28.2% vs. 9.1%, p=0.041). However, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect tomode of onset, other clinical signs at presentation biochemical parameters, and smooth muscle antibody positivity.Elderly patients have a greater frequency of cirrhosis at presentation, anti-nuclear antibody, HLA DR4 positivity than patients <50 years, and they have a lower occurrence of treatment failure. Conventional corticosteroid regimens may be an effective management for older patients with autoimmune hepatitis.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623287","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-nuclear antibody","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_antibody"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.819236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.701005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.603196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.541879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"HLA-DR","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DR"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
