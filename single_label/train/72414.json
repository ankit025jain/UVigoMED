{"id":72414,"title":"[Experimental research in vitro of TK/GCV system for osteosarcoma MG-63 cell damage].","abstract":"To study the killing effects of the liposome-mediated thymidine kinase (TK)/ganciclovir (GCV) system on MG-63 osteosarcoma (OS) cells and its bystander effects.Liposome-mediated TK gene transfected into MG-63 OS cells, the efficiency of transfection was analyzed by flow cytometry and observed under inverted fluorescence microscope. Non-transfected osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were divided into three groups,in the experimental group 1 transfected TK/GCV cells cultured in solutiona liquid mixture by supernatant by 1/10,1/7,1/5,1/2 ratio to original broth; in the experimental group 2 transfected cells cultured in solutiona liquid mixture of supernatant filtered through 0.22 microm filter by 1/10,1/7, 1/5, 1/2 ratio to original broth, in control group the transfection cells cultured in original culture solution. Cell growth inhibition rate and osteosarcoma cell sensitivity to TK/GCV system were measured by MTT assay in each group.The TK gene was transfected into MG-63 OS cells successfully by liposome-mediated, flow cytometry instrument detection TK gene transfection cell transfection efficiency can reach 75.5%. Six days later the MTT assay showed that in the experimental group 1 inhibition rate of all concentration ratio of the mixed culture fluid were statistically significant as compared with the control group (P < 0.05), and in the experimental group 2 that of the 1/10 and 1/7 of concentration ratio of mixed culture medium was not statistically significant as compared with the control group (P > 0.05). TK gene transfected MG-63 cells increased with the the GCV concentration,the cell apoptosis rate increased.The experiment demonstrated that the MG-63 OS cells are sensitive to the liposome-mediated TK/GCV system and bystander effects are significant.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974430","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.824296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.7941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.744301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.662376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.625106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Thymidine","weight":0.615535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.589967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.526716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.482171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.46082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.40129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.39817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.192973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Thymidine kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine_kinase"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Cell damage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_damage"}]}
