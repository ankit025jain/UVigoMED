{"id":27993,"title":"[Major drug related problems leading to hospital admission in the elderly].","abstract":"Drug related problems represent an important problem in geriatric patients, and contribute to hospitalization in 15 to 30% of the admissions. In most cases this concerns adverse drug reactions (normal dose and overdose) but also drug therapy failures (e.g. undertreatment) are common. The main pharmacological classes involved are cardiovascular drugs and drugs for the central nervous system. Drug related problems can be prevented by regular medication review to decide if all drugs have to be continued, and to check for adverse drug reactions. Clinical pharmacists in hospitals can detect drug related problems (over-, under- and misuse using a systematic approach) and recommend changes to improve pharmacotherapy. The community pharmacist can help by elaborating drug schemes, by screening for medication interactions, and by resolving practical problems.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055454","annotations":[{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical pharmacy","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacy"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.381649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Cheque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"}]}
