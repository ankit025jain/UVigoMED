{"id":50885,"title":"Self-management behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional survey in western urban China.","abstract":"To investigate the current status of diabetic self-management behavior and the factors influencing this behavior in Chengdu, a typical city in western China.We performed stratified sampling in 6 urban districts of Chengdu. We used questionnaires concerning self-management knowledge, self-management beliefs, self-management efficacy, social support, and self-management behavior to investigate patients with T2DM from August to November 2011. All of the data were analyzed using the SPSS 17.0 statistical package.We enrolled a total of 364 patients in the present study. The median score of self-management behavior was 111.00, the interquartile range was 100.00-119.00, and the index score was 77.77. Self-management was described as \"good\" in 46%, \"fair\" in 45%, and \"poor\" in 6% of patients. A multiple-factor analysis identified age (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.91; P?=?0.026), education in \"foot care\" (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-0.99; P?=?0.048), self-management knowledge (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92; P<0.001), self-management belief (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P?=?0.002), self-efficacy (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96; P<0.001), and social support (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.94; P?=?0.023) as positive factors. Negative factors included diabetes duration (5-9 years: OR, 14.82; 95% CI, 1.64-133.73; P?=?0.016; and ?10 years: OR, 10.28; 95% CI, 1.06-99.79; P?=?0.045) and hospitalization experience (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.64-5.36; P<0.001).We observed good self-management behavior in patients with T2DM in Chengdu. When self-management education is provided, age, education, knowledge, belief, self-efficacy, and social support should be considered to offer more appropriate intervention and to improve patients' behavior.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743326","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical
