These benign tumors are incidentally diagnosed most often in an asymptomatic form. Sometimes it is multiple bilateral tumors affecting the renal parenchyma and forming a renal oncocytosis. We report the case of a unilateral right renal oncocytosis, very rare situation, characterized by a right renal parenchymal nodules with oncocytoma and a normal left kidney.
