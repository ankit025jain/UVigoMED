{"id":78582,"title":"Medical management of tinnitus: role of the physician.","abstract":"Tinnitus is a common auditory complaint that can be caused by many auditory as well as nonauditory systems diseases. Comorbidities including insomnia, anxiety, and depression are common in severe tinnitus. Other factors such as personality characteristics and socioeconomic difficulties can also contribute to tinnitus distress. Management of tinnitus therefore requires diagnosis and treatment expertise by physicians to adequately address existing etiologies and comorbidities, as well as relevant expertise by nonphysician specialists such as audiologists and psychologists. In assessing the efficacy of tinnitus treatments, nonspecific effects such as placebo effects must be taken into consideration. Management of complex tinnitus cases often requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Physicians and nonphysician specialists need to promptly refer patients to relevant specialist colleagues for adequate evaluation and treatment when such needs are present.
