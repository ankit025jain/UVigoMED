{"id":21086,"title":"Muddy clinical waters: a missed pulmonary embolus.","abstract":"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) can be difficult to make. The consequences of missing a PE can be fatal and clinicians should always be vigilant. This case presents a patient admitted with fluctuations in consciousness and in a septic state. A preliminary diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia was made, and the patient went on to have an exploratory surgical procedure with no remarkable findings. Only after further investigation of the patient's fluctuations in consciousness was a retrospective diagnosis of a large PE made. The patient was anticoagulated and made a full recovery, with no outstanding pulmonary issues at follow-up 6 weeks after discharge. A prolonged immobile state, likely in part due to the patient's septic state and psychiatric history, along with recent surgery and hospitalisation were the most obvious risk factors.
