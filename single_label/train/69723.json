{"id":69723,"title":"[First Russian nationwide molecular epidemiological study for melanoma: results of BRAF mutation analysis].","abstract":"This report presents the initial results of the first Russian molecular epidemiological study of melanoma. The investigation included 1035 patients with stage IIIB-IV melanoma residing in various regions of Russia. Sequencing of BRAF gene revealed mutation in 627 (60.6%) tumors; c.1799T > A (p.V600E) substitution was detected in 563 cases, and other mutations in 64 melanomas. Frequency of BRAF alterations was significantly higher in patients of younger age (< 50 years: 72.9%; > or = 50 years: 57.1%; p = 0.00003). 710 melanomas included in the study were located in sun non-exposed regions of the skin; this category of tumors was characterized by the highest occurrence of BRAF mutations (63.9%). In conclusion, more than a half of Russian patients with advanced melanoma are potential candidates for the treatment of kinase inhibitors of mutated BRAF.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306614","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.582254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.42859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.168492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.126925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"1799","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1799"},{"name":"1035","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1035"},{"name":"Subdivisions of Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Russia"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
