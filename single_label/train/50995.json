{"id":50995,"title":"Association between vitamin D status and physical function in the severely obese.","abstract":"Mortality is 85% higher in severely obese subjects (body mass index [BMI] > 40 kg/m(2)) than in subjects with a healthy BMI; poor physical function may be contributory. Hypovitaminosis D is common in obese subjects and is associated with physical dysfunction in the elderly.We determined the relationship between vitamin D status and physical function in severely obese subjects.We conducted a clinic-based, cross-sectional study of severely obese subjects. Participants were stratified into three groups according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) vitamin D status categorization.We compared levels of self-reported activity and times taken to walk 500 m and to ascend and descend a 17-cm step 50 times.We recruited 252 subjects (age, 43.7 ± 11.2 y; BMI, 50.7 ± 9.7 kg/m(2)); 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were less than 30 nmol/L in 109 participants. Participants with a 25OHD > 50 nmol/L, compared to those with a 25OHD < 30 nmol/L, had the highest activity levels (3.1 ± 3.4 h/wk versus 1.5 ± 2.5 h/wk; P = .015) and the shortest 500-m walk times (6.2 ± 1.1 min versus 7.4 ± 1.5 min; P = .003). Serum 25OHD concentrations had a weakly positive association with activity level (r = 0.19; P = .008) and a moderately negative association with 500-m walk time (r = -0.343; P < .001).Vitamin D status had a significant relationship with physical activity and physical function in this cohort of severely obese subjects. Low activity levels are likely to perpetuate the problem of hypovitaminosis D due to less time spent outdoors. Studies exploring the effects of vitamin D supplementation in this population are warranted.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735426","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.799732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Institute of Medicine","weight":0.675558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.65626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.491175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0547413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/252"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Ascend","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascend"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Weak interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
