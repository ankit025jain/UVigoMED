{"id":24544,"title":"Technical issues in the use of the radial artery as a coronary artery bypass conduit.","abstract":"The clinical and angiographic benefits related to the use of the radial artery (RA) as a bypass conduit have extensively been proven. However, due to its morpho-functional features and its anatomic position, successful use of the RA requires careful consideration of several technical issues. We herein summarize the current evidence on all the technical aspects related to the RA use in coronary surgery such as the preoperative evaluation of ulnar compensation, the different means of intraoperative vasodilatation, and the various harvesting techniques.
