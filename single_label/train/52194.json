{"id":52194,"title":"Empagliflozin monotherapy with sitagliptin as an active comparator in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.","abstract":"We aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of empagliflozin, an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had not received drug treatment in the preceding 12 weeks.Between Aug 12, 2010, and March 19, 2012, we randomly allocated 228 patients to receive placebo, 224 to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 224 to receive empagliflozin 25 mg, and 223 to receive sitagliptin. Compared with placebo, adjusted mean differences in change from baseline HbA1c at week 24 were -0·74% (95% CI -0·88 to -0·59; p<0·0001) for empagliflozin 10 mg, -0·85% (-0·99 to -0·71; p<0·0001) for empagliflozin 25 mg, and -0·73% (-0·88 to -0·59; p<0·0001) for sitagliptin. 140 (61%) patients in the placebo group reported adverse events (four [2%] severe and six [3%] serious), as did 123 (55%) patients in the empagliflozin 10 mg group (eight [4%] severe and eight [4%] serious), 135 (60%) patients in the empagliflozin 25 mg group (seven [3%] severe and five [2%] serious), and 119 (53%) patients in the sitagliptin group (five [2%] severe and six [3%] serious).Empagliflozin provides a tolerable and efficacious strategy to reduce HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received drug treatment.Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622369","annotations":[{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Boehringer Ingelheim","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim"},{"name":"Eli Lilly and Company","weight":0.872678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.58967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.252692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
