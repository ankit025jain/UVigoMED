{"id":37445,"title":"Prevalence and risk of Down syndrome in monozygotic and dizygotic multiple pregnancies in Europe: implications for prenatal screening.","abstract":"To determine risk of Down syndrome (DS) in multiple relative to singleton pregnancies, and compare prenatal diagnosis rates and pregnancy outcome.Population-based prevalence study based on EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries.Eight European countries.14.8 million births 1990-2009; 2.89% multiple births.DS cases included livebirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). Zygosity is inferred from like/unlike sex for birth denominators, and from concordance for DS cases.Relative risk (RR) of DS per fetus/baby from multiple versus singleton pregnancies and per pregnancy in monozygotic/dizygotic versus singleton pregnancies. Proportion of prenatally diagnosed and pregnancy outcome.Poisson and logistic regression stratified for maternal age, country and time.Overall, the adjusted (adj) RR of DS for fetus/babies from multiple versus singleton pregnancies was 0.58 (95% CI 0.53-0.62), similar for all maternal ages except for mothers over 44, for whom it was considerably lower. In 8.7% of twin pairs affected by DS, both co-twins were diagnosed with the condition. The adjRR of DS for monozygotic versus singleton pregnancies was 0.34 (95% CI 0.25-0.44) and for dizygotic versus singleton pregnancies 1.34 (95% CI 1.23-1.46). DS fetuses from multiple births were less likely to be prenatally diagnosed than singletons (adjOR 0.62 [95% CI 0.50-0.78]) and following diagnosis less likely to be TOPFA (adjOR 0.40 [95% CI 0.27-0.59]).The risk of DS per fetus/baby is lower in multiple than singleton pregnancies. These estimates can be used for genetic counselling and prenatal screening.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495335","annotations":[{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.672859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Advanced maternal age","weight":0.625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.54469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.476536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.440855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Monozygotic","weight":0.291534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monozygotic"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.0214189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Dizygotic","weight":0.0131816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizygotic"}]}
