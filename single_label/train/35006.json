{"id":35006,"title":"Prenatal skeletal dysplasia phenotype in severe MLII alpha/beta with novel GNPTAB mutation.","abstract":"We report a neonate who was diagnosed as a case of skeletal dysplasia during pregnancy, and was subsequently diagnosed as a case of MLII alpha/beta on the basis of clinical and radiological findings and molecular testing of the parents. A novel GNPTAB mutation c.1701delC [p.F566LfsX5] was identified in the father. The case reiterates the severe prenatal phenotype of MLII alpha/beta which mimics skeletal dysplasia and illustrates the utility of molecular genetic analysis in confirmation of diagnosis and subsequent genetic counselling.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685522","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.46559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Osteochondrodysplasia","weight":0.135444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrodysplasia"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
