{"id":72322,"title":"Dual role of host Par2 in a murine model of spontaneous metastatic B16 melanoma.","abstract":"We investigated differences of metastatic spread of normal proteinase-activated receptor-2 (Par2+/+) melanoma B16 in Par2-/- (knock-out) animals compared to C57Bl6 mice.Nine knock-out mice B6.Cg-F2rl1tm1Mslb/J (Par2-/-) and nine C57Bl6/J controls were subcutaneously inoculated with B16 melanoma tissue cells. Twelve days after inoculation, all primary tumors were removed. Survival and metastatic spread was followed for up to 100 days after primary tumor extirpation.Excised primary tumors were on average larger in Par2-/- mice (360 mm3 vs. 221 mm3 in C57Bl6/J). Distant spontaneous metastases developed in only 3 of 9 of Par2-/- mice in comparison to 6 of 9 controls. The average survival time was 84 days in Par2-/- animals compared to 63 days in C57Bl6/J mice.Host Par2 melanoma model contributes to the limitation of local cancer progression in one area, while on the other hand is important for enhancing distant metastatic spread.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982362","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.789135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.765562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.352396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Extinction","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction"},{"name":"Parchive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":".tm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tm"},{"name":"Dual role","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_role"},{"name":"Toyota C transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_C_transmission"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Par, Cornwall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par,_Cornwall"}]}
