{"id":69120,"title":"Detection of glucose via enzyme-coupling reaction based on a DT-diaphorase fluorescence probe.","abstract":"Enzyme-coupling reactions play an important role in the assay of analytes. In this manuscript, we developed a new fluorescent probe for the detection of glucose through the enzyme-coupling reaction of DT-diaphorase (DTD). The probe was synthesized through a mild and simple synthetic procedure, and showed good fluorescence response to DTD. The reactions for the detection of glucose proceed as follows: glucose dehydrogenase oxidizes glucose to gluconolactone with NAD(+) as the electron acceptor to yield NADH, and NADH can be utilized by DTD to further react with the probe releasing resorufin. As a result of these tandem reactions, fluorescence off-on response will occur. The method showed high selectivity for glucose with a detection limit of 0.2 ÂµM, which may provide a potential way for fluorescence detection of glucose through enzyme-coupling reactions. Furthermore, the applicability of the method has been demonstrated by detecting glucose in human urine samples.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468396","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Electron acceptor","weight":0.756999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_acceptor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.642533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.482862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.110525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Document Type Definition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition"},{"name":"Glucono delta-lactone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucono_delta-lactone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Yield (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cascade reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_reaction"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"}]}
