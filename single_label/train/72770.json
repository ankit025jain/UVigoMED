{"id":72770,"title":"Controlling female cancer in Argentina. Divergent initiatives and the road to fragmentation.","abstract":"This article analyses the organisation of cancer control in Argentina, with a special focus on the initiatives, institutions, and models that targeted female or gynaecological cancers. It identifies and examines the main factors in the process of elaborating a national policy to control the disease drawing on a series of actors and instruments such as the state, medical professionals, institutions and services, and the use of technology (notably diagnostic tools) for the detection of the disease. It traces the developments in the organisation highlighting its transformations from a centralising to a decentralised model of service provision. Using the concept of \"path-dependence\" the article examines the continuities and changes observed in the organisation of female cancer critically signalling the particular time at which a path was taken where \"fragmentation\" became consolidated within the health system. It also argues that it was within the field of cancer diagnosis that Argentinian doctors first sought to create the foundational structures of cancer organisation. The article contends that the path-dependence analytical approach helps us acknowledge the importance of historical analysis in the identification of factors that led to the lack of service coordination, including the persistent strain between national/provincial states that hampered the development of comprehensive programmes, aspects that have continued to mark efforts in the elaboration of cancer policies to the present day.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24944432","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.503001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"History","weight":0.307617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.159585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.14971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Decentralization","weight":0.135596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Service
