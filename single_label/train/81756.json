{"id":81756,"title":"[Application of three-dimensional printing technique in repair and reconstruction of maxillofacial bone defect].","abstract":"To explore the application of three-dimensional (3-D) printing technique in repair and reconstruction of maxillofacial bone defect.The related literature on the recent advance in the application of 3-D printing technique for repair and reconstructing maxillofacial bone defect was reviewed and summarized in the following aspects: 3-D models for teaching, preoperative planning, and practicing; surgical templates for accurate positioning during operation; individual implantable prosthetics for repair and reconstructing the maxillofacial bone defect.3-D printing technique is profoundly affecting the treatment level in repair and reconstruction of maxillofacial bone defect.3-D printing technique will promote the development of the repair and reconstructing maxillofacial bone defect toward more accurate, personalized, and safer surgery.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844006","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.515908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Printing","weight":0.361053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.210374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.193233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.190491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"3D modeling","weight":0.151888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.10852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"3D printing","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0562242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
