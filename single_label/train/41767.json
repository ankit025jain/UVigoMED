{"id":41767,"title":"Optimal selection of methods for mini-invasive treatment of extrahepatic bile duct stones.","abstract":"This study aims to identify the optimal mini-invasive treatment for extrahepatic bile duct stones.One hundred and seventy eight patients with EHBD stones were randomized into 4 groups: laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) plus T-tube drainage (group LT), LC and LCBDE with endonasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube (group LE), and endoscopic sphincterotomy with ENBD followed by LC (group EE) and T-tube drainage of open CBDE (group OT). Demographic data, perioperative findings, postoperative outcomes, hospital expense, gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) scores and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were analyzed.The operating time was longest in group EE. There was less bleeding in group OT and EE. Group LE and EE had shorter hospital stay and recovery time of intestinal motility. The postoperative white blood cell count and serum C-reaction protein level were higher in group LT and OT. Postoperatively, the mean GIQLI scores in group LE and EE were higher. Mean cost were highest in group EE. Patients in group LE had lowest cost per QALY.The modified laparoscopic procedure, LC combined with LCBDE followed by a primary closure over the ENBD tubes, appears to be the best option for patients with EHBD stones.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901128","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.514899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.397507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.304581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anal sphincterotomy","weight":0.194905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sphincterotomy"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Electrical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"}]}
