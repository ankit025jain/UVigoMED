{"id":16860,"title":"[Miraculous catch by neutrophils NETs].","abstract":"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) account for a new mechanism of anti-infectious innate immunity that may lead to important tissue damages. Indeed, a growing number of studies demonstrate the involvement of NET in the pathogenesis of several human diseases as diverse as autoimmune diseases, thrombotic disorders or some inflammatory diseases. After a short description of molecular mechanisms of NETosis and its host-defense function, we will review their detrimental effects. We will then examine the potential therapeutic approaches for modulating excessive or inappropriate NETosis and thereby minimize tissue injury.
