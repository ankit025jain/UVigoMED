{"id":84327,"title":"The use of pneumatic tourniquet in total knee arthroplasty: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Pneumatic tourniquet use in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is always a controversial issue. The aim of the present study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of its use in patients receiving primary unilateral TKA, and to explore the most safe and effective protocols.This review was based on cochrane methodology for conducting meta-analysis. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for this study. The participants were adults who had undergone primary unilateral TKA. The Review Manager Database (RevMan version 5.0, The Cochrane Collaboration 2008) was used to analyze the dates of the selected studies.Thirteen RCTs involving 859 patients were included in this analysis. The use of tourniquet could significantly reduce operation time (mean difference -5.01 min, P = 0.003), intraoperative blood loss (mean difference -201.85 ml, P < 0.00001) and total blood loss volumes (mean difference -125.03 ml, P = 0.61). But postoperative (mean difference 45.99 ml, P = 0.68) were slightly increased in that situation. With respect to surgical complications, a tendency of increasing risk ratio was observed for tourniquet group.Our results indicate that tourniquet application could reduce surgical time, intraoperative blood loss and total blood loss, but increases postoperative total blood loss. With respect to postoperative complications, DVT and surgical site infection rates are relatively augmented in the tourniquet group.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128975","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.855198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.799516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.797743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.586326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.279787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.2707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.257643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"TKA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKA"},{"name":"Tourniquet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"859","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/859"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"The Current (radio program)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Current_(radio_program)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Buffy vs. Dracula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_vs._Dracula"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
