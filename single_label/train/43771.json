{"id":43771,"title":"A contemporary series of patients undergoing open debridement for necrotizing pancreatitis.","abstract":"For patients with acute pancreatitis complicated by infected necrosis, minimally invasive techniques have taken hold without substantial comparison with open surgery. We present a contemporary series of open necrosectomies as a benchmark for newer techniques.Using a prospective database, we retrospectively identified consecutive patients undergoing debridement for necrotizing pancreatitis (2006 to 2009). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.Sixty-eight patients underwent debridement for pancreatic/peripancreatic necrosis. In-hospital mortality was 8.8% (n = 6). Infection (n = 43, 63%) and failure-to-thrive (n = 13, 19%) comprised the most common indications for necrosectomy. The false negative rate (FNR) for infection of percutaneous aspirate was 20.0%. Older age (P = .02), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score upon admission (P = .03) or preoperatively (P < .01), preoperative intensive care unit admission (P = .01), and postoperative organ failure (P = .03) were associated with mortality.Open debridement for necrotizing pancreatitis results in a low mortality, providing a useful comparator for other interventions. Given the high FNR of percutaneous aspirate, debridement should not be predicated on proven infection.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767969","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.756345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.378737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.340757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.283171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.205801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.020738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferredoxin-NADP+_reductase"},{"name":"Comparator","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparator"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
