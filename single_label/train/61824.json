{"id":61824,"title":"Rapid progression of anemia related to tumor-lysis syndrome associated with bortezomib treatment in myeloma patients.","abstract":"Tumor-lysis syndrome is a rare complication in patients with multiple myeloma. However, bortezomib treatment for myeloma is often associated with tumor-lysis syndrome.We developed an index called the rapid anemia progression index, which represents the duration and progression of anemia, to evaluate risk factors for tumor-lysis syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed 35 relapsed or refractory myeloma patients treated with bortezomib-containing treatment in our institution. We analyzed various parameters, including albumin, lactase dehydrogenase, ?2-microglobulin and creatinine, similar to the rapid anemia progression index, and evaluated the risk factors for tumor-lysis syndrome associated with bortezomib by the Cairo-Bishop definition.Clinical tumor-lysis syndrome occurred in six patients (17.1%). Tumor-lysis syndrome occurred during the first course of bortezomib-containing treatment among all the patients. The result of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the rapid anemia progression index was 0.759 (P = 0.049). The rapid anemia progression index was more accurate than the index of lactate dehydrogenase, ?2-microglobulin, albumin and creatinine according to the receiver operating characteristic curve. For a cut-off point of -1.12 for the rapid anemia progression index, the sensitivity and specificity were 66.7 and 82.8%, respectively.The rapid anemia progression index is related to clinical tumor-lysis syndrome associated with bortezomib treatment for multiple myeloma patients with a cut-off point of -1.12 g/dl/month.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664944","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.836512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.682687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Lactase","weight":0.674607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.459522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.316544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"759","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/759"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
