{"id":47686,"title":"Expression and prognostic significance of p21-activated kinase 6 in hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) 6 is a serine-threonine kinase belonging to the PAK family. Previous studies have indicated that abnormal expressions of PAK1, PAK2, and PAK5 played critical roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent studies suggested that deregulation of PAK6 expression played an important role in oncogenesis. To explore the potential roles of PAK6 in HCC, expression of PAK6 was detected in human HCC specimens.Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed for PAK6 in 121 HCC samples. The data were correlated with clinicopathologic features. The univariate and multivariate survival analyses were also performed to determine their clinical prognostic significance.PAK6 was overexpressed in HCC as compared with the adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. High expression of PAK6 was associated with Edmondson-Steiner grade (P = 0.006) and number of tumor nodules (P < 0.001), and PAK6 was positively correlated with proliferation marker Ki-67 (P < 0.01). Univariate analysis suggested that PAK6 expression was associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that PAK6 and Ki-67 protein expressions were independent prognostic markers for HCC (P = 0.0245 and 0.0331, respectively).Our results suggest that PAK6 overexpression is involved in the pathogenesis of HCC; it may be an independent poor prognostic factor for HCC.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576777","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.897423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.852645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.454785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.42904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.413398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"PAK1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAK1"},{"name":"PAK2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAK2"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Deregulation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
