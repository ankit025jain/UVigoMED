{"id":45560,"title":"Circulating pro- and anti-angiogenic mediators in patients infected with hepatitis C at different stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor characterized by neovascularization. The objective of the current study was to determine circulating proangiogenic [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-?)] and antiangiogenic [IL-4, IL-12, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and angiostatin] factors in Egyptian patients with different stages of HCC. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the concentrations of these mediators in plasma of 135 HCC patients (57 Child-Pugh A, 24 Child-Pugh B, and 54 Child-Pugh C stage) and 50 healthy subjects. Results showed a significant increase in plasma levels of VEGF (P?<?0.001), PDGF (P?<?0.001), TNF-? (P?<?0.01), angiostatin (P?<?0.01), and IP-10 (P?<?0.001) and a significant reduction in IL-12 (P?<?0.001) in HCC patients in relation to normal controls. Classifying HCC patients based on their Child-Pugh's score revealed that the maximum production of proangiogenic mediators (VEGF and TNF-?) was present in HCC patients with Child-Pugh C score which coincides with maximum reduction in antiangiogenic mediators (IL-4, IL-12, and angiostatin). Taken together, these results indicated that the determination of these factors in different Child-Pugh's scores of HCC might be an important guide in clinical decision making regarding therapy and outcome.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677137","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Angiostatin","weight":0.869543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiostatin"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.851745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.798357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Platelet-derived growth factor","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.38322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.220642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
