{"id":68724,"title":"\"Seeing a doctor is just like having a date\": a qualitative study on doctor shopping among overactive bladder patients in Hong Kong.","abstract":"Although having a regular primary care provider is noted to be beneficial to health, doctor shopping has been documented as a common treatment seeking behavior among chronically ill patients in different countries. However, little research has been conducted into the reasons behind doctor shopping behavior among patients with overactive bladder, and even less into how this behavior relates to these patients' illness and social experiences, perceptions, and cultural practices. Therefore, this study examines overactive bladder patients to investigate the reasons behind doctor shopping behavior.My study takes a qualitative approach, conducting 30 semi-structured individual interviews, with 30 overactive bladder patients in Hong Kong.My study found six primary themes that influenced doctor shopping behavior: lack of perceived need, convenience, work-provided medical insurance, unpleasant experiences with doctors, searching for a match doctor, and switching between biomedicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Besides the perceptual factors, participants' social environment, illness experiences, personal cultural preference, and cultural beliefs also intertwined to generate their doctor shopping behavior. Due to the low perceived need for a regular personal primary care physician, environmental factors such as time, locational convenience, and work-provided medical insurance became decisive in doctor shopping behavior. Patients' unpleasant illness experiences, stemming from a lack of understanding among many primary care doctors about overactive bladder, contributed to participants' sense of mismatch with these doctors, which induced them to shop for another doctor.Overactive bladder is a chronic bladder condition with very limited treatment outcome. Although patients with overactive bladder often require specialty urology treatment, it is usually beneficial for the patients to receive continuous, coordinated, comprehensive, and patient-centered support from their primary care providers. Primary care doctors' understanding on patients with overactive bladder with empathetic attitudes is important to reduce the motivations of doctor shopping behavior among these patients.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502367","annotations":[{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.923983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.722842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.607829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"China","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Biomedicine","weight":0.432491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedicine"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.424845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.199442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Empathy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0184033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Shopping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"}]}
