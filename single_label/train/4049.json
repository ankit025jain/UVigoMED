{"id":4049,"title":"Migraine prevalence, disability, and sociodemographic properties in the eastern region of Turkey: a population-based door-to-door survey.","abstract":"To determine the frequency of migraine in the eastern part of Turkey and its sociodemographic characteristics, impact on disability, and clinical aspects.The study was conducted door-to-door in the eastern part of Turkey. Those who suffered from headaches were diagnosed with migraine as per the 2004 diagnosis criteria of the International Headache Society and its frequency was determined. Demographic data and Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores were recorded.Of the individuals evaluated, 60.4% (883) suffered from headaches, of which 43.6% (637) were evaluated as nonmigraine and 16.8% (246) as migraine headaches. Migraine prevalence was detected to be 10.3% (75) in men and 23.1% (171) in women. When the MIDAS scale was considered, 7.3% of the patients were classified with mild pain, 36.9% with mild to moderate pain, 41% with moderate pain, and 14.6% with severe pain.Migraine headache has a wide and complex range of symptoms and is frequently observed in women and young adults. The prevalence of migraine among the general population of eastern Turkey was found to be similar to the averages in the rest of the country, as well to the averages of studies in Europe.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551933","annotations":[{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.815722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.558821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.446566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.367217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.311293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.147589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.147074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.125733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0398575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"International Headache Society","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Headache_Society"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"883","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/883"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Eastern Anatolia Region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Anatolia_Region"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
