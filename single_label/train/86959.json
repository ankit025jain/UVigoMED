{"id":86959,"title":"Terminal sialic acid linkages determine different cell infectivities of human parainfluenza virus type 1 and type 3.","abstract":"Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV1) and type 3 (hPIV3) initiate infection by sialic acid binding. Here, we investigated sialic acid linkage specificities for binding and infection of hPIV1 and hPIV3 by using sialic acid linkage-modified cells treated with sialidases or sialyltransferases. The hPIV1 is bound to only ?2,3-linked sialic acid residues, whereas hPIV3 is bound to ?2,6-linked sialic acid residues in addition to ?2,3-linked sialic acid residues in human red blood cells. ?2,3 linkage-specific sialidase treatment of LLC-MK2 cells and A549 cells decreased the infectivity of hPIV1 but not that of hPIV3. Treatment of A549 cells with ?2,3 linkage-specific sialyltransferase increased infectivities of both hPIV1 and hPIV3, whereas ?2,6 linkage-specific sialyltransferase treatment increased only hPIV3 infectivity. Clinical isolates also showed similar sialic acid linkage specificities. We concluded that hPIV1 utilizes only ?2,3 sialic acid linkages and that hPIV3 makes use of ?2,6 sialic acid linkages in addition to ?2,3 sialic acid linkages as viral receptors.
