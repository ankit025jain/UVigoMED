{"id":26232,"title":"[Percutaneous edge-to-edge repair using the MitraClip system].","abstract":"Percutaneous edge-to-edge repair with the MitraClip system has emerged as a new therapeutic option for moderate to severe or severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Several clinical studies demonstrated its safety and efficacy in patients with both degenerative and functional MR. Based on these results, this catheter-based therapy received CE mark for both etiologies of MR in 2008, and approval from United States (US) Food and Drug Administration for degenerative MR with prohibited surgical risk in 2013. To date, around 12,000 patients underwent the MitraClip therapy worldwide. In the present review article, we describe the concept and procedural steps of the MitraClip therapy, results of major clinical trials, and current status in US.
