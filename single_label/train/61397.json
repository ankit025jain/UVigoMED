{"id":61397,"title":"[The progress in treatment for malignant lymphomas and the future direction].","abstract":"The prognosis of patients with malignant lymphoma was improved with the development of multi-agent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and monoclonal antibody. Half of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas which were previously considered to be incurable, are able to achieve cure after appropriate treatment. Furthermore, natural history of indolent B-cell lymphoma was improved by the introduction of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Because Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most favorable prognosis among adult malignancies, current studies focus on a reduction of acute and late toxicity by decreasing treatment intensity. On the other hand, there has been tremendous advances in the pathology, biology and molecular characterization of lymphomas. As a result, novel molecular targeted agents have been developed in recent years. The treatment for malignant lymphoma is currently undergoing a paradigm shift away from conventional chemotherapy toward molecular targeted agents based on the biological understanding.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724394","annotations":[{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.593124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.435876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.381468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.304678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.0422074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Paradigm shift","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0193761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Multi-agent system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system"}]}
