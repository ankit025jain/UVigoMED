{"id":68665,"title":"Left ventricular mass in dialysis patients, determinants and relation with outcome. Results from the COnvective TRansport STudy (CONTRAST).","abstract":"Left ventricular mass (LVM) is known to be related to overall and cardiovascular mortality in end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients. The aims of the present study are 1) to determine whether LVM is associated with mortality and various cardiovascular events and 2) to identify determinants of LVM including biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis.Analysis was performed with data of 327 ESKD patients, a subset from the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST). Echocardiography was performed at baseline. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the relation of LVM tertiles with clinical events. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify factors associated with LVM.Median age was 65 (IQR: 54-73) years, 203 (61%) were male and median LVM was 227 (IQR: 183-279) grams. The risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR)?=?1.73, 95% CI: 1.11-2.99), cardiovascular death (HR?=?3.66, 95% CI: 1.35-10.05) and sudden death (HR?=?13.06; 95% CI: 6.60-107) was increased in the highest tertile (>260 grams) of LVM. In the multivariable analysis positive relations with LVM were found for male gender (B?=?38.8±10.3), residual renal function (B?=?17.9±8.0), phosphate binder therapy (B?=?16.9±8.5), and an inverse relation for a previous kidney transplantation (B?=?-41.1±7.6) and albumin (B?=?-2.9±1.1). Interleukin-6 (Il-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hepcidin-25 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were not related to LVM.We confirm the relation between a high LVM and outcome and expand the evidence for increased risk of sudden death. No relationship was found between LVM and markers of inflammation and fibrosis.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN38365125.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital
