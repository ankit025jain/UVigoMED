{"id":66154,"title":"Interventional radiologic techniques for screening, diagnosis and treatment of patients with renal artery stenosis.","abstract":"Renal artery stenosis resulting in renovascular hypertension or renal ischemia is a potentially treatable condition that results in increased morbidity and mortality, especially among older individuals. Sophisticated imaging techniques are used for screening and identification of affected patients to guide therapy. Treatment guidelines recommend intervention in patients with significant renal artery stenosis, although recent evidence has questioned the benefit of intervention in certain populations. Current research focuses on improving the specificity of imaging techniques and determining which imaging modalities best identify patients who will benefit from intervention.
