{"id":56811,"title":"Reliability and validity of Cirrus and Spectralis optical coherence tomography for detecting retinal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"To evaluate and compare the ability of two Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices to detect retinal and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with healthy subjects; to test the intra-session reliability of two OCT devices in AD patients and healthy subjects.AD patients (n=75) and age-matched healthy subjects (n=75) underwent three Macular Cube 200 × 200 protocols using the Cirrus and Spectralis OCT devices and three 360° circular scans centred on the optic disc using the Cirrus OCT device, the classic glaucoma application, and the new Nsite Axonal Analytics application of the Spectralis OCT instrument. Differences between healthy and AD eyes were compared, and measurements provided by each OCT protocol were compared. Reliability was measured using intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation. Correlations between OCT measurements and disease duration and severity were also analysed.Retinal thinning was observed in AD eyes in all areas except the fovea using both OCT devices. RNFL atrophy was detected in AD eyes with all three protocols, but the Nsite Axonal application was the most sensitive. Measurements by the two OCT devices were correlated, but differed significantly. Reliability was good using all protocols, but better with the glaucoma application of Spectralis. Mean RNFL thickness provided by the Nsite Axonal application correlated with disease duration.Fourier-domain OCT is a valid and reliable technique for detecting subclinical RNFL and retinal atrophy in AD, especially using the Nsite Axonal application. RNFL thickness decreased with disease duration.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625377","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.870234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.623035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.548198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.250336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Optic disc","weight":0.194893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.172373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0619954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Statistical Methods for Research Workers","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Progressive retinal atrophy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_retinal_atrophy"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analytics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics"}]}
