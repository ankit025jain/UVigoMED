Zinserling (Tsinzerling) school of infectious pathology: advances and prospects].","abstract":"The paper analyzes the importance of infectious pathology today and discusses the main achievements of A.V. Zinserling (Tsinzerling) and his collaborators when having studied the pathologic anatomy of infectious diseases, primarily respiratory, intestinal, intrauterine ones. An indication is given to the significance of clinic and morphological comparisons, a problem of mixed infections. There is evidence that A.V. Zinserling's studies have opened the new area of science tissue microbiology in which some progress has been also achieved in recent years.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745185","annotations":[{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Anatomical pathology","weight":0.280357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.163403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"}]}
