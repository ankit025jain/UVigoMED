{"id":82310,"title":"Expression of AEG-1 and microvessel density correlates with metastasis and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) expression is up-regulated in various human cancers and plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. The aim of this study was to explore AEG-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and to assess whether it is associated with microvessel density (MVD), metastasis, and survival. Specimens from 87 patients with OSCC were investigated by immunohistochemistry staining for AEG-1 and MVD. By statistical analysis, we studied the correlations between the expression of AEG-1 and MVD and various clinicopathological factors, including overall survival (OS). We found that AEG-1 was highly expressed in 51.72% of OSCC. Expression was closely correlated with differentiation, clinical stage, T classification, and lymph node metastasis. The MVD had similar results. Expression of AEG-1 correlated positively with MVD. The lymph node metastatic rate in patients with high AEG-1/high MVD was significantly higher than in patients with high AEG-1/low MVD, low AEG-1/high MVD, or low AEG-1/low MVD. Patients with high AEG-1 expression showed far lower OS rates than those with low expression. For MVD, there were similar results. Only AEG-1 and MVD expression were independent prognostic factors for OS by multivariate analysis. Expression of AEG-1 may be correlated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis and is a valuable prognostic factor in patients with OSCC.
