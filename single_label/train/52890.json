{"id":52890,"title":"18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic variability in functioning oncocytic parathyroid adenoma with brown tumors.","abstract":"A 29-year-old female patient exhibited a solitary neck mass, severe hypercalcemia, and multiple skeletal lytic lesions consistent with metastatic neoplastic disease. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of the neck lesion indicated a follicular thyroid neoplasm. CT-guided bone biopsy was non-diagnostic. Subsequent 18F-FDG PET/CT examination demonstrated avid glucose uptake within the neck mass and diffuse bony lesions of variable metabolic activity. Repeat biopsy utilizing PET/CT guidance produced core tissue with classic histologic features of a brown tumor. Postoperative histology revealed an exclusively oncocytic parathyroid adenoma. Atypical radiotracer uptake of this rare functioning adenoma subtype is illustrated with discussion of improved procedural diagnostic yield utilizing PET/CT.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561686","annotations":[{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.868908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hypercalcaemia","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalcaemia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Thyroid neoplasm","weight":0.751605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_neoplasm"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lytic cycle","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.403008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"}]}
