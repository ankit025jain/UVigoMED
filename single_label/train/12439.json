{"id":12439,"title":"Effects of equol on gene expression in female cynomolgus monkey iliac arteries.","abstract":"To examine effects of equol, the soy phytoestrogen metabolite, on gene expression in the monkey iliac artery.A high fat/high cholesterol diet was fed to eight ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys for 6.5 years. After biopsy of the left iliac artery, the animals were randomized to two treatment groups for 8 months; the treatment groups were equol (23.7 mg/100 g diet, n = 4) and vehicle (n = 4). The right iliac artery was removed at necropsy. Gene expression in the iliac arteries in response to equol was determined by DNA microarray. Comparison of atherosclerotic lesions and plasma lipids at pre-versus post-equol treatment time points and in vehicle versus equol treatment groups did not identify any significant differences. Despite the lack of effect of equol on these parameters, 59 genes were down-regulated and 279 were up-regulated in response to equol. Comparison of these data to previous work identified 10 genes regulated in opposite directions by equol compared to presence of atherosclerosis plaque (Menopause 2011; 18:1087-1095) and 55 genes differentially expressed in the same direction in response to both equol and estradiol (Eyster et al., Menopause 2014;21:143-152.).Similar responses of genes to both equol and estradiol may reflect the extent to which equol serves as a natural selective estrogen receptor modulator in the arteries. Opposite responses of 10 genes to equol versus the presence of atherosclerosis implicates those genes in the potential protective effects of equol in arteries.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525253","annotations":[{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Selective estrogen receptor modulator","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_estrogen_receptor_modulator"},{"name":"Phytoestrogens","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogens"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.837401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Soybean","weight":0.693393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.690117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.575714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Crab-eating macaque","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"}]}
