{"id":4484,"title":"Mechanism of the \"dark\" axonal degeneration in the central nervous system.","abstract":"In the central nervous tissue, two types of transsection-resulted axonal degeneration are generally accepted: \"watery\" and \"dark\". The present paper deals with the assumption that the mechanism of this kind of \"dark\" axonal degeneration has a relationship with that of the \"dark\" neuronal degeneration.A minute stab wound is inflicted in the parietal cortex of the rat brain. From 1 h to 3 months postinjury, the resulted ultrastructural events in two distant regions of the corticospinal tract (internal capsule and C3 region of the corticospinal tract) are studied.As a novel finding, the first morphological process of \"dark\" axonal degeneration was found to consists in a striking reduction of the distances between neighboring neurofilaments, which were readily distinguishable and apparently undamaged. This pattern (compacted ultrastructure) persisted for hours. By day 1 postinjury, the compacted axoplasmic elements aggregated into a homogenous and dense (\"dark\") mass in which hardly any ultrastructural elements could be distinguished. Surrounded by apparently normal or mildly abnormal myelin sheat, this mass underwent a non-isotropic shrinkage during the next three months. Morphological signs of phagocytosis were insignificant.The ultrastructural events during the first day post-injury suggest a non-enzymatic mechanism as an alternative to the prevailing molecular-biological mechanism.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518260","annotations":[{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Internal capsule","weight":0.852371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_capsule"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Corticospinal tract","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticospinal_tract"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Nervous tissue","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_tissue"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.472752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Neurofilament","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofilament"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.196653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Axoplasm","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axoplasm"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Stabbing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabbing"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Surrounded","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrounded"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"}]}
