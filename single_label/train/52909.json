{"id":52909,"title":"Development of pectinate-ispagula mucilage mucoadhesive beads of metformin HCl by central composite design.","abstract":"Ionotropically-gelled mucoadhesive beads of metformin HCl composed of low methoxy (LM) pectin-ispaghula husk mucilage (IHM) polymer-blend was developed and optimized using central composite design (spherical type, single center point, and ?=1.414). Effects of LM pectin and IHM amounts on drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) and cumulative drug release at 10h (R10h) were analysed using response surface methodology. The optimized beads containing metformin HCl (F-O) showed DEE of 86.98 ± 3.26% and R10h of 47.20 ± 1.28%. All these beads exhibited suitable controlled in vitro sustained drug release pattern with super case-II transport mechanism over 10h. These beads were also characterized by SEM and FTIR. The optimized beads also exhibited pH-dependent swelling, good mucoadhesivity with goat intestinal mucosa and significant hypoglycemic effect in alloxan-induced diabetic rats over prolonged period after oral administration, which could possibly be lucrative in terms of prolonged systemic absorption of metformin HCl maintaining tight blood glucose level and advanced patient compliance.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System
