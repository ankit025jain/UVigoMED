{"id":27719,"title":"[Association study of CNR1, GAD1 and BDNF polymorphisms with male heroin dependence in the Dai population in Yunnan].","abstract":"In order to analyze the association of CNR1(Cannabinoid receptor 1), GAD1(Glutamate decarboxylase 1), and BDNF(Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) polymorphisms with male heroin dependence in the Dai population in Yunnan Province, an eight-SNP co-amplification protocol was established to genotype on the SNaPshot platform. A case-control study was performed with 8 SNPs from CNR1, GAD1, and BDNF genes in 165 heroin-dependent males and 170 healthy males of the Dai population. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS17.0, Haploview4.2, PHASE2.1, and MDR software. We found that: (1) the genotype frequency of rs13306221 was significant in the case group (P<0.025); (2) the A allelic frequency of rs6265 was significantly higher in the case group; (3) the haplotypes of T-A-C, C-C-C, C-C-T, and T-C-C based on rs1978340-rs3791878-rs11542313 and haplotype A-G based on rs6265-rs13306221 were significant (P<0.05); (4) the haplotype frequencies of T-A-C, C-C-T, and A-G were significantly higher in the case group. These results indicate that the linkage between rs1978340 and rs3791878 in GAD1 has a strong association with heroin dependence. Furthermore, polymorphisms in CNR1 (rs1049353), GAD1 (rs1978340 and rs11542313), and BDNF (rs6265 and rs13306221) were associated with heroin dependence in the Yunnan Dai population, and individuals with the rs6265 A allele were more likely to be heroin dependent.
