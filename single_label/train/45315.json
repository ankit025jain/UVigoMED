{"id":45315,"title":"Hepatocellular carcinoma: concomitant sorafenib promotes necrosis after radiofrequency ablation--propensity score matching analysis.","abstract":"To retrospectively compare radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (hereafter, sorafenib-RFA) and RFA alone in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Between January 2007 and December 2011, 16 patients (mean age, 72.8 years; age range 52-84 years; 10 men, six women) with HCC tumors less than 3 cm in diameter were included in the sorafenib-RFA group, and 136 patients (mean age, 72.1 years; age range, 51-86 years; 92 men, 44 women) with HCC tumors less than 3 cm in diameter were included in the RFA alone (control) group. Mean diameters of the greatest long-axis dimensions of HCC were 22.8 mm ± 4.6 (standard deviation) in the sorafenib-RFA group and 18.1 mm ± 4.4 in the control group. RFA was performed immediately after the 7-day administration of sorafenib. Propensity score matching analysis was used to adjust for potential biases.Fifteen of the 16 patients in the sorafenib-RFA group and 30 of the 136 patients in the control group were selected during propensity score matching. No significant differences between the sorafenib-RFA group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 30) were observed with regard to age, sex, etiology, Child-Pugh class, tumor size, puncture number, needle size, location at the liver margin, or location adjacent to a main vessel. The respective mean diameters of the greatest long- and short-axis dimensions of the RFA-induced ablated area were 46.3 mm ± 10.3 and 33.0 mm ± 6.9 in the sorafenib-RFA group and 32.9 mm ± 7.6 and 25.6 mm ± 5.7 in the control group; both of these dimensions were significantly larger in the sorafenib-RFA group (both P < .001).Sorafenib-RFA may be superior to standard RFA alone in the treatment of HCC tumors smaller than 3 cm in diameter.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Digestive System
