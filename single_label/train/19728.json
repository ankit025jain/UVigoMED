{"id":19728,"title":"New insights into the relationship between viral infection and pregnancy complications.","abstract":"A recent study by McDonnold and coinvestigators published in Am J Obstet Gynecol reports an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and preeclampsia. The investigation was based on the hypothesis that HPV trophoblast infection results in failed trophoblast invasion, and placental dysfunction and hypoxia. The findings from this study along with previous data addressing the relationship between viral infection and obstetrical complications highlight the relevance of viral infection during pregnancy. A better understanding of mechanisms via which virus leads to pregnancy complications will drive us closer to finding a strategy to prevent adverse outcomes.
