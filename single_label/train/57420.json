{"id":57420,"title":"World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project: I. Surgical phenotype data collection in endometriosis research.","abstract":"To standardize the recording of surgical phenotypic information on endometriosis and related sample collections obtained at laparoscopy, allowing large-scale collaborative research into the condition.An international collaboration involving 34 clinical/academic centers and three industry collaborators from 16 countries.Two workshops were conducted in 2013, bringing together 54 clinical, academic, and industry leaders in endometriosis research and management worldwide.None.A postsurgical scoring sheet containing general and gynecological patient and procedural information, extent of disease, the location and type of endometriotic lesion, and any other findings was developed during several rounds of review. Comments and any systematic surgical data collection tools used in the reviewers' centers were incorporated.The development of a standard recommended (SSF) and minimum required (MSF) form to collect data on the surgical phenotype of endometriosis.SSF and MSF include detailed descriptions of lesions, modes of procedures and sample collection, comorbidities, and potential residual disease at the end of surgery, along with previously published instruments such as the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine and Endometriosis Fertility Index classification tools for comparison and validation.This is the first multicenter, international collaboration between academic centers and industry addressing standardization of phenotypic data collection for a specific disease. The Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project SSF and MSF are essential tools to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis by allowing large-scale collaborative research into the condition.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150390","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.509956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.471952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.355079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.334504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.210309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.187801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0492993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"American Society for Reproductive Medicine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Reproductive_Medicine"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Reproductive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_medicine"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
