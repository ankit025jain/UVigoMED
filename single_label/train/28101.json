{"id":28101,"title":"[The impact of psilocybin on visual perception and spatial orientation--neuropsychological approach].","abstract":"Psilocybin is a substance of natural origin, occurring in hallucinogenic mushrooms (most common in the Psilocybe family). After its synthesis in 1958 research began on its psychoactive properties, particularly strong effects on visual perception and spatial orientation. Due to the very broad spectrum of psilocybin effects research began on the different ranges of its actions--including the effect on physiological processes (such as eye saccada movements). Neuro-imaging and neurophysiological research (positron emission tomography-PET and electroencephalography-EEG), indicate a change in the rate of metabolism of the brain and desync cerebral hemispheres. Experimental studies show the changes in visual perception and distortion from psilocybin in the handwriting style of patients examined. There are widely described subjective experiences reported by the subjects. There are also efforts to apply testing via questionnaire on people under the influence of psilocybin, in the context of the similarity of psilocybin-induced state to the initial stages of schizophrenia, as well as research aimed at creating an 'artificial' model of the disease.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007546","annotations":[{"name":"Psilocybin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.70242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Hallucinogen","weight":0.687646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.649749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Psilocybin mushroom","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.598102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Qualia","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.490766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.487178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Mushroom","weight":0.47894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.355676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Psilocybe","weight":0.112303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybe"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Orientation (mental)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(mental)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
