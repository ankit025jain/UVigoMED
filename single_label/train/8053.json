{"id":8053,"title":"Prevention of abdominal aortic aneurysm by anti-microRNA-712 or anti-microRNA-205 in angiotensin II-infused mice.","abstract":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized as a progressive dilation and degradation of the aortic wall, associated with activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammation. Emerging evidence indicates a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in AAA pathogenesis, but it is unclear whether abdominal aortic endothelial miRNAs play a role in the disease process. We aimed to identify miRNAs in the abdominal aortic endothelium that play a critical role in AAA development.The mouse model of AAA induced by angiotensin II infusion was used in this study. Through a miRNA array and validation study, we initially identified the murine-specific miR-712 and subsequently its human/murine homolog miR-205 as angiotensin II-induced miRNAs in the abdominal aortic endothelium in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, miR-712 stimulated MMP activity in the aortic wall by directly targeting 2 MMP inhibitors: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK). Silencing of miR-712 and miR-205 by using anti-miR-712 and anti-miR-205, respectively, significantly decreased the aortic MMP activity and inflammation, preventing AAA development in angiotensin II-infused ApoE(-/-) mice. Further, upregulation of 4 angiotensin II-sensitive miRNAs, miR-205, -21, -133b, and -378, identified in this murine study were confirmed in human AAA samples compared with nondiseased control.Our results demonstrate that angiotensin II-sensitive miR-712 and its human homolog miR-205 downregulate TIMP3 and RECK, which in turn stimulate aortic MMP activity and inflammation, leading to AAA development. Targeting these miRNAs may be a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent AAA.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812324","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.717131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.702896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.647214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.619996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.510248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.457162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.419937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.332256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.330124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.29073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.132057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.110315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"TIMP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMP3"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Abdominal aorta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta"}]}
