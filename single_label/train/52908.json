{"id":52908,"title":"Concordance of nasal and diabetic foot ulcer staphylococcal colonization.","abstract":"Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is an important risk factor for surgical site infections. The goal of this study was to investigate the concordance between nasal and diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) SA carriage. Seventy-nine subjects with DFUs were assessed for nasal and DFU colonization with SA, including methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA). Twenty-five (31.6%) subjects had nares colonization with SA; 29 (36.7%) had DFU colonization with SA. Seven (8.8%) subjects had nares colonization with MRSA, and 7 (8.8%) had DFU colonization with MRSA. Ulcer duration was associated with MRSA presence (P = 0.01). Sensitivity and specificity of positive nasal SA colonization with positive DFU colonization were 41% and 74%. We found substantial discordance between SA strains colonizing DFU and the nasal cavity. The poor positive predictive values for SA isolation in a DFU based on nasal carriage suggests that SA colonization of a DFU by endogenous SA strains cannot be assumed.
