{"id":11037,"title":"What investigators need to know about the use of animals.","abstract":"Investigators conducting research with animal subjects have an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure they are treated humanely. The system of animal research oversight in the United States consists of a framework of federal, state, local, and institutional requirements. Institutions supported by the Public Health Service (PHS) are required to follow the guidelines mandated by the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and establish institutional animal care and use committees (IACUC) to oversee animal research activities. This system of self-monitoring at the local level is central to assuring an effective and compliant animal care and use program. Integral to this system is the responsibility of the investigator for the stewardship of their research animal subjects. No activities may be conducted without IACUC approval. Investigators are accountable for all aspects of their animal research activities from preparing their funding applications and complying with the terms and conditions of awards to protecting the investment in research with animals. This review acts as a succinct resource and provides references for investigators supported by the PHS to understand the main expectations and requirements when using animals in research.
