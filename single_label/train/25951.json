{"id":25951,"title":"[Plasminogen activation and regulation of fibrinolysis].","abstract":"Plasminogen activator-plasmin system is the central role for thrombus degradation. The system is finely tuned to allow healing of a blood vessel lesion without compromising the stability of the fibrin thrombus, and to localize fibrinolytic activity to the damaged area. There is a dynamic balance between fibrinolytic factors (plasminogen activators and plasmin) and inhibitory proteins (PAL-1, alpha2-plasmin inhibitor, and TAFIa). An alternative pathway for fibrinolysis that comprises leukocyte elastase and its interaction with the plasminogen activator-plasmin system has been suggested.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163311","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Elastase","weight":0.697919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastase"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.658078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.43011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.253045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.131806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Neutrophil elastase","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_elastase"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"PAL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Fine-tuned Universe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Tire balance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_balance"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
