{"id":10662,"title":"Targeted overexpression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-4 modifies post-myocardial infarction remodeling in mice.","abstract":"Myocardial infarction (MI) causes an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and is associated with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling. A uniform reduction in TIMP-4 post-MI has been observed.To examine post-MI remodeling with cardiac-restricted overexpression of TIMP-4, either through a transgenic or viral delivery approach.MI was induced in mice and then randomized to targeted injection of an adenoviral construct (10 ?L; 8Ã—10(9) plaque forming units/mL) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the full-length human TIMP-4 (Ad-GFP-TIMP4) or GFP. A transgenic construct with cardiac-restricted overexpression TIMP-4 (hTIMP-4exp) was used in a parallel set of studies. LV end-diastolic volume, an index of LV remodeling, increased by >60% from baseline at 5 days post-MI and by >100% at 21 days post-MI in the Ad-GFP only group. However, LV dilation was reduced by ?50% in both the Ad-GFP-TIMP4 and hTIMP-4exp groups at these post-MI time points. LV ejection fraction was improved with either Ad-GFP-TIMP-4 or hTIMP-4exp. Fibrillar collagen expression and content were increased within the MI region with both TIMP-4 interventions, suggestive of matrix stabilization.This study is the first to demonstrate that selective myocardial targeting for TIMP-4 induction through either a viral or transgenic approach favorably altered the course of adverse LV remodeling post-MI. Thus, localized induction of endogenous matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, such as TIMP-4, holds promise as a means to interrupt the progression of post-MI remodeling.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637197","annotations":[{"name":"Green fluorescent
