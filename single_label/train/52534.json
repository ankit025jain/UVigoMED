{"id":52534,"title":"Strength training alters MCT1-protein expression and exercise-induced translocation in erythrocytes of men with non-insulin-dependent type-2 diabetes.","abstract":"We investigated the cellular distribution of lactate transporter (MCT1) and its chaperone CD147 (using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting) in the erythrocytes of men with non-insulin-dependent type-2 diabetes (NIDDM, n = 11, 61 Â± 8 years of age) under acute exercise (ergometer cycling test, World Health Organisation scheme) performed before and after a 3-month strength training program. Cytosolic MCT1 distribution and membraneous CD147 density did not change after acute exercise (ergometer). After the 3-month strength training, MCT1-density was increased and the reaction of MCT1 (but not that of CD147) towards acute exercise (ergometer) was altered. MCT1 localisation was shifted from the centre to the cellular membrane. This resulted in a decrease in the immunohistochemically measured cytosolic MCT1-density. We conclude that strength training alters the acute exercise reaction of MCT1 but not that of CD147 in erythrocytes in patients with NIDDM. This reaction may contribute to long-term normalisation and stabilisation of the regulation of lactate plasma concentration in NIDDM.
