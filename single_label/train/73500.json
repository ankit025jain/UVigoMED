{"id":73500,"title":"Non-cutaneous melanoma: is there a role for (18)F-FDG PET-CT?","abstract":"Non-cutaneous melanomas (NCM) are diverse and relatively uncommon. They often differ from cutaneous melanomas in their epidemiology, genetic profile and biological behaviour. Despite the growing body of evidence regarding the utility of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in cutaneous melanoma, the data on its use in NCM are scarce. In this review, we will summarize the existing literature and present cases from our experience with NCM to illustrate current knowledge on the potential role and limitations of fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose PET/CT in NCM.
