{"id":47738,"title":"Overview of single-port laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancers: past, present, and the future.","abstract":"Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) is implemented through a tailored minimal single incision through which a number of laparoscopic instruments access. Introduction of operation-customized port system, utilization of a camera without a separate external light, and instruments with different lengths has brought the favorable environment for SPLS. However, performing SPLS still creates several hardships compared to multiport laparoscopic surgery; a single-port system inevitably leads to clashing of surgical instruments due to crowding. To overcome such difficulties, investigators has developed novel concepts and maneuvers, including the concept of inverse triangulation and the maneuvers of pivoting, spreading out dissection, hanging suture, and transluminal traction. The final destination of SPLS is expected to be a completely seamless operation, maximizing the minimal invasiveness. Specimen extraction through the umbilicus can undermine cosmesis by inducing a larger incision. Therefore, hybrid laparoscopic technique, which combined laparoscopic surgical technique with natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE)--i.e., transvaginal or transanal route-, has been developed. SPLS and NOSE seemed to be the best combination in pursuit of minimal invasiveness. In the near future, robotic SPLS with natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery's way of specimen extraction seems to be pursued. It is expected to provide a completely or nearly complete seamless operation regardless of location of the lesion in the abdomen.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574772","annotations":[{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.726578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.708486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.700622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.665782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.653301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.502511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.476702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgical instrument","weight":0.382205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_instrument"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.135174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Hanging","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging"},{"name":"Triangulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation"},{"name":"Cosmesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmesis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Ports collection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ports_collection"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Seamless","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamless"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
