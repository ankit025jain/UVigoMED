{"id":74236,"title":"Direct oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism--evidence from major clinical trials.","abstract":"For decades the antithrombotic management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was limited to parenteral heparin formulations and oral vitamin K antagonists. Even though both classes of anticoagulants are effective, they have several limitations, including a narrow therapeutic window and the need to monitor anticoagulant activity. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) that specifically target factor IIa or Xa have emerged. Recent data suggest that they are at least as effective and as safe as conventional therapy and have practical advantages, such as fixed dose regimen and no need for laboratory monitoring. Hence, they represent a major step forward in the acute treatment and long-term prevention of VTE. In this review, we outline the use of DOACs in the management of VTE and provide an overview of recently published major trials.
