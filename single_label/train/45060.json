{"id":45060,"title":"Jejunal feeding in patients with pancreatitis.","abstract":"Patients with severe acute pancreatitis complicated by organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis or fluid collections should have placement of a double-lumen nasogastric-jejunal tube to be used for both gastric decompression and jejunal feeding. These patients are at risk for gastric outlet obstruction, which may be treated so that complications such as aspiration and reflux are avoided. Furthermore, early enteral feeding can prevent ileus, suppress further organ failure, and ultimately restore gut function if continued in an uninterrupted manner. Ultimately, this patient population will benefit from pancreatic rest and jejunal feeding specifically when compared with patients using nasogastric feeding tubes.
