{"id":79437,"title":"Do newly built homes affect rhinitis in children? The ISAAC phase III study in Korea.","abstract":"As Korea has experienced rapid economic development, the lifestyles of Koreans have become more Westernized, in terms of urbanization and dietary habits. Also, the prevalences of allergic diseases, such as rhinitis, asthma, and dermatitis, have increased rapidly. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the symptoms of rhinitis conditions, including rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, overlapped rhinitis, and overlapped allergic rhinitis, among Korean children aged 6-7 years.The study subjects were drawn from participants in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) study in 2010 and were aged 6-7 years. We analysed data for a total of 3804 children.The prevalences of symptoms suggestive of rhinitis and allergic rhinitis in the previous 12 months were 43.4% and 22.1%, respectively. For overlapped rhinitis and overlapped allergic rhinitis, only 2.5% and 1.9% of the children had overlapping symptoms, having rhinitis with asthma and eczema simultaneously. Gender, a parental history of allergic disease, mould or dampness at home, and the risk factors for 'sick building syndrome' (SBS) were risk factors influencing rhinitis diseases. In particular, a history of moving to a newly built home in the child's infancy was strongly associated with symptoms of all the rhinitis diseases examined.This study identified patterns of the prevalence of rhinitis conditions among Korean children that were similar to those reported in Western countries. We confirmed that a history of moving to a newly built home during infancy was associated with a considerable risk of rhinitis conditions.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428419","annotations":[{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.863895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.745403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.708347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mold","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.61387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.396664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Urbanization","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization"},{"name":"Sick building syndrome","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_building_syndrome"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Koreans","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans"},{"name":"Special Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Economic development","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.0279451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Water content","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_content"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
