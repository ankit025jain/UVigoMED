{"id":16305,"title":"[Clinical analysis of 29 cases of cervical necrotizing fasciitis].","abstract":"To study the experience of clinical features and treatment of deep cervical necrotizing fasciitis.All 29 cases of cervical necrotizing fasciitis patients were diagnosed by CT, 12 cases underwent tracheostomies, lateral neck incisions and drainage operations, the other 17 patients underwent lateral neck incisions and drainage operations. Sequently washing, dressing changes and anti infection treatments were taken.Twenty-eight cases were cured, 1 cases died. During a follow-up of half a year,no relapse.When patient was sufferd the cervical necrotizing fasciitis, surgical operation for exploration should be taken as soon as possible,and incision and drainage in the treatment of cervical abscess would obtain a satisfactory curative effect, which would prevent serious complications.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026831","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.787992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.74466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.325845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.224413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Necrotizing fasciitis","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_fasciitis"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Incision and drainage","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incision_and_drainage"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Fasciitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciitis"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Washing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing"}]}
