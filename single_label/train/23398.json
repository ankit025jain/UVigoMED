{"id":23398,"title":"Intrinsic CD4+ T cell sensitivity and response to a pathogen are set and sustained by avidity for thymic and peripheral complexes of self peptide and MHC.","abstract":"Interactions of T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) with complexes of self peptide and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are crucial to T cell development, but their role in peripheral T cell responses remains unclear. Specific and nonspecific stimulation of LLO56 and LLO118 T cells, which transgenically express a TCR specific for the same Listeria monocytogenes epitope, elicited distinct interleukin 2 (IL-2) and phosphorylated kinase Erk responses, the strength of which was set in the thymus and maintained in the periphery in proportion to the avidity of the binding of the TCR to the self peptide-MHC complex. Deprivation of self peptide-MHC substantially compromised the population expansion of LLO56 T cells in response to L. monocytogenes in vivo. Despite their very different self-reactivity, LLO56 T cells and LLO118 T cells bound cognate peptide-MHC with an identical affinity, which challenges associations made between these parameters. Our findings highlight a crucial role for selecting ligands encountered during thymic 'education' in determining the intrinsic functionality of CD4+ T cells.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487322","annotations":[{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.922904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.891139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.725933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Avidity","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidity"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.647315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.613683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.417779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
