{"id":92689,"title":"CCL27 is downregulated by interferon gamma via epidermal growth factor receptor in normal human epidermal keratinocytes.","abstract":"The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK)/CCL27 is indispensable in skin inflammation. CTACK/CCL27 is exclusively produced by epidermal keratinocytes to attract CCR10-expressing T lymphocytes to the skin. We investigated the mechanism of CTACK/CCL27 production from normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF? and IFN?. CTACK/CCL27 production was induced by TNF? via ERK, JNK, p38, and NF?B. The induction of CTACK/CCL27 by TNF? was suppressed by IFN? via a pathway dependent on JAK, STAT1, and STAT3. Our results also demonstrated that IFN? and TNF? induced the phosphorylation of EGFR and the following phosphorylation of ERK, which is partly responsible for the suppressive effect of IFN? on TNF?-induced production of CTACK/CCL27. Peri-lesional skin of psoriasis demonstrates early inflammatory changes as we have previously reported. CTACK/CCL27 expression was diffuse in the peri-lesional epidermis, while it was restricted to basal layer in lesional epidermis, suggesting that CTACK/CCL27 expression was induced in the early stage of psoriatic plaque formation, and IFN? could participate in the suppression of CTACK/CCL27 expression in the lesional epidermis, reflecting the later stage of psoriatic plaque formation. Our study suggests that CTACK/CCL27 may have a pivotal role in the early stage of psoriasis plaque formation, but should be downregulated in the later stage to induce inflammation characteristic for chronic psoriasis plaques.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710735","annotations":[{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"STAT1","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT1"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.777114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.760895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.695105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.598879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.405764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.325768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.289481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.24466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
