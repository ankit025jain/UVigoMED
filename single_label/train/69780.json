{"id":69780,"title":"Papillary haemangioma: a case report of multiple facial location.","abstract":"Papillary haemangiomas were recently defined as morphologically distinct and benign cutaneous haemangiomas showing a predominantly intravascular capillary proliferation within dilated thin-walled dermal blood vessels. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with multiple eruptive red-bluish raised papules and nodules distributed over the skin of the chin that were related to a papillary haemangioma.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291870","annotations":[{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.704236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.554805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.449421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Chin","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Renal papilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_papilla"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
