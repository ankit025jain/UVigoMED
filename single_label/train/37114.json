{"id":37114,"title":"[Total anorectal reconstruction after proctocolectomy: surgical results and functional outcome].","abstract":"The aim of this report is to describe a novel technical approach to total anorectal reconstruction and show surgical results and functional outcome. The technique is an innovative surgery to restore gastrointestinal perineal continuity after coloproctectomy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. We made the internal anal sphincter replacement with demucosated small bowel plication, the external anal sphincter replacement with an artificial bowel sphincter (ABS) and the restitution of intestinal transit with and ileal \"S\" pouch. After 12 months follow-up the control of gas is irregular, normal continence to solid stool was achieved with only occasional minimal soiling after defecation. The Jorge-Wexner incontinence score is 6 (moderate incontinence). The fecal incontinence quality of life (FIQL) comparing stoma vs. non-stomas, shows a relevant clinical difference, with improvement in all scales. This study has limitations because it is preliminary, observational and with no control group. We conclude that this recent surgical technique requires expertise in pelvic floor surgery and management of fecal incontinence. The surgeon should be able not only to introduce an artificial anal sphincter, but also to make the plication of intestinal muscle layer to create a zone of high pressure in anal canal and the ileal pouch.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516957","annotations":[{"name":"Stoma (medicine)","weight":0.911406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Sphincter ani internus muscle","weight":0.822088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter_ani_internus_muscle"},{"name":"Pelvic floor","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Familial adenomatous polyposis","weight":0.714882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis"},{"name":"Anal canal","weight":0.703031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.697123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Sphincter ani externus muscle","weight":0.632366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter_ani_externus_muscle"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.406734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Proctocolectomy","weight":0.350303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctocolectomy"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Ileo-anal pouch","weight":0.261584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileo-anal_pouch"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Pouch (marsupial)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouch_(marsupial)"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
