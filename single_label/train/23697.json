{"id":23697,"title":"Antibacterial resistance: an overview.","abstract":"The development of antibiotics, represents one of the most important advances in the therapeutics both in control or cure of serious infections and in the prevention, treatment of infection complications. However as the antibiotics are vastly overprescribed in OPD settings and the availability of these drugs without prescription, are facilitating the development of resistance, the present article outlines the causes and mechanisms of antibacterial resistance as well as simple preventive measures at various levels and future prospects.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475559","annotations":[{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.604901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Outpatient department","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_department"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
