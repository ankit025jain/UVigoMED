{"id":56122,"title":"Time course of dichoptic masking in normals and suppression in amblyopes.","abstract":"To better understand the relationship between dichoptic masking in normal vision and suppression in amblyopia we address three questions: First, what is the time course of dichoptic masking in normals and amblyopes? Second, is interocular suppression low-pass or band-pass in its spatial dependence? And third, in the above two regards, is dichoptic masking in normals different from amblyopic suppression?We measured the dependence of dichoptic masking in normal controls and amblyopes on the temporal duration of presentation under three conditions; monocular (the nontested eye-i.e., dominant eye of normals or nonamblyopic eye of amblyopes, being patched), dichoptic-luminance (the nontested eye seeing a mean luminance-i.e., a DC component) and dichoptic-contrast (the nontested eye seeing high-contrast visual noise). The subject had to detect a letter in the other eye, the contrast of which was varied.We found that threshold elevation relative to the patched condition occurred in both normals and amblyopes when the nontested eye saw either 1/f or band-pass filtered noise, but not just mean luminance (i.e., there was no masking from the DC component that corresponds to a channel responsive to a spatial frequency of 0 cyc/deg); longer presentation of the target (corresponding to lower temporal frequencies) produced greater threshold elevation.Dichoptic masking exhibits similar properties in both subject groups, being low-pass temporally and band-pass spatially, so that masking was greatest at the longest presentation durations and was not greatly affected by mean luminance in the nontested eye.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744203","annotations":[{"name":"Luminance","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Spatial frequency","weight":0.795292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.615129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.54244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.438578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Low-pass filter","weight":0.392566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter"},{"name":"Band-pass filter","weight":0.26931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-pass_filter"},{"name":"Channel (communications)","weight":0.184596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(communications)"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.157746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Spatial dependence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Direct current","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Auditory masking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_masking"},{"name":"Filter (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Monocular","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular"},{"name":"Ocular dominance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_dominance"},{"name":"DC bias","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
