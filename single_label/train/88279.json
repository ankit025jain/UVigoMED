{"id":88279,"title":"Amputation characteristics vary by branch of service.","abstract":"This study examines the amputees from the Army and Marine Corps, the two military branches that have sustained the majority of combat-related amputations. All U.S. service members who sustained major extremity amputations from October 2001 through July 2011 were analyzed. Amputation levels, demographics, and mounted or dismounted status at injury were examined. There were 835 Army and 344 Marine amputees; 52.9% of all Marine amputees occurred during 2010 and 2011. Over 50% of Marine and 44% of Army amputees sustaining an amputation during 2010 and 2011 sustained multiple amputations. Dismounted service members had significantly (p < .0001) higher Injury Severity Scores and were significantly more likely to sustain double (p = .0082) and triple (p < .0001) amputations than mounted personnel. Marine amputees were significantly (p < .0001) more likely to be dismounted than Army amputees. The number of multiple amputees increased substantially in 2010 and 2011. Marine amputees, particularly dismounted, are at an increased risk of sustaining multiple amputations.
