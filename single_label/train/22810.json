{"id":22810,"title":"CD14 -159C/T polymorphism contributes to the susceptibility to tuberculosis: evidence from pooled 1,700 cases and 1,816 controls.","abstract":"CD14 is a receptor for lipopolysaccharide and plays an important role in innate immune against infections induced by microorganisms. A functional polymorphism in promoter region of CD14 gene, -159C/T, was extensively investigated with tuberculosis (TB) risk, but the association results were inconclusive. We performed a meta-analysis to synthesize association results of CD14 -159C/T polymorphism with TB risk from 8 studies including 1,700 TB cases and 1,816 controls. Based on the heterogeneity between studies evaluated by ?2-based Q test, a fixed- or random-effect model was applied to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Potential publication bias was evaluated with the funnel plot as well as the linear regression asymmetry test proposed by Egger et al. We found that the -159T allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of TB (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.61) as compared with -159C allele. Individuals with -159TT genotype showed a significantly increased risk of TB than those with -159CT/CC genotype (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.11-2.08). These associations were not attributed to potential publication bias (P>0.05 for Egger's test). The results from this meta-analysis indicate that CD14 -159C/T polymorphism is associated with TB predisposition and may serve as a candidate of susceptibility biomarker for TB.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
