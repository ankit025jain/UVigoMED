{"id":20181,"title":"Reduced incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease after introduction of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine in Navarre, Spain, 2001-2013.","abstract":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) were licensed for use in children and became available for private purchase in Spain in 2001 (PCV7), 2009 (PCV10) and 2010 (PCV13). This study evaluates changes in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and the pattern of serotypes isolated in Navarre, Spain, between the period of use of PCV7 (2004-2009) and that of PCV13 (2010-2013). The percentage of children <2 years who received at least one dose of PCV in these periods ranged from 25 to 61% and 61 to 78%, respectively. Between the periods 2004-2009 and 2010-2013 IPD incidence declined by 37%, from 14.9 to 9.4 cases/100,000 inhabitants (p<0.001). In children <5 years it fell by 69% (p<0.001), in persons aged 5-64 years, by 34% (p<0.001), and in those ? 65, by 23% (p=0.024). The incidence of cases due to PCV13 serotypes declined by 81% (p<0.001) in children <5 years and by 52% (p<0.001) in the whole population. No significant changes were seen in the distribution of clinical presentations or in disease severity. The incidence of IPD has declined and the pattern of serotypes causing IPD has changed notably in children and moderately in adults following the replacement of PCV7 by PCV13.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674661","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.524587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.520962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.217545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Navarre","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarre"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"City of license","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_license"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
