{"id":20189,"title":"Co-colonization of vanA and vanB Enterococcus faecium of clonal complex 17 in a patient with bacteremia due to vanA E. faecium.","abstract":"A 53-year-old Vietnamese man with liver cirrhosis was transferred from a Vietnamese hospital to our tertiary care hospital in Korea in order to undergo a liver transplantation. Bacteremia due to vanA Enterococcus faecium was diagnosed, and stool surveillance cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were positive for both vanA and vanB E. faecium. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the 2 vanA VRE isolates from the blood and stool were clonal, but the vanB VRE was unrelated to the vanA VRE. vanA and vanB VRE were ST64 and ST18, single-allele variations of clonal complex 17, respectively. This is the first case report of vanA VRE bacteremia in a Vietnamese patient and demonstrates the reemergence of vanB VRE since a single outbreak occurred 15years ago in Korea. The reemergence of vanB VRE emphasizes the importance of VRE genotyping to prevent the spread of new VRE strains.
