{"id":35178,"title":"Chronic neuronopathic type of Gaucher's disease with progressive myoclonic epilepsy in the absence of visceromegaly and bone involvement.","abstract":"Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Gaucher's disease has three clinical types: non-neuronopathic (Type 1), Acute Neuropathic (Type 2) and chronic neuronopathic (Type 3). The chronic neuronopathic (Type 3) is characterised by a variety of disease variants with onset in childhood with hepatomegaly, skeletal lesions and later slow horizontal saccades, treatment-resistant generalised tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, dementia, progressive spasticity, cognitive deterioration, ataxia and death in the second or third decade of life.We describe a case of a 17-year-old girl who was born normally but subsequently developed treatment-refractory seizures at the age of nine with myoclonus, oculomotor apraxia, ataxia and cognitive decline. Enzyme activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase was found to be low without visceromegaly or bone involvement.Screening for lysosomal enzyme activity should be done in patients exhibiting features suggestive of progressive myoclonic epilepsy.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671628","annotations":[{"name":"Gaucher's disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucher's_disease"},{"name":"Lysosomal storage disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosomal_storage_disease"},{"name":"Hepatomegaly","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatomegaly"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.888348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Myoclonus","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoclonus"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Apraxia","weight":0.778803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.714257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Saccade","weight":0.450773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.436965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.351722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.345252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.183204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Oculomotor nerve","weight":0.119851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Glucocerebrosidase","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocerebrosidase"},{"name":"Progressive myoclonic epilepsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_myoclonic_epilepsy"},{"name":"Tonic-clonic seizure","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic-clonic_seizure"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"}]}
