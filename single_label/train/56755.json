{"id":56755,"title":"Active aspiration of suprachoroidal hemorrhage using a guarded needle.","abstract":"To describe a novel technique using a guarded needle to drain suprachoroidal hemorrhage.A guarded needle is used to drain suprachoroidal hemorrhage under direct microscope visualization. A scleral buckling sleeve is used to create a guarded 26-gauge needle to avoid over-penetration of the needle beyond the suprachoroidal space. Active extrusion can be used to drain suprachoroidal blood.The authors report two cases in which active aspiration using a guarded needle was successful in draining suprachoroidal hemorrhage without complications. In both cases, the vitreous cavity could be restored, allowing for subsequent pars plana vitrectomy.The technique of active aspiration using a guarded needle optimizes surgeon control of suprachoroidal hemorrhage drainage and also has the added benefit of easy transition to secondary vitrectomy after drainage has been completed.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635157","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.479276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Scleral buckle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_buckle"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Sleeve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Buckling","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling"},{"name":"Stopping power","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_power"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Phase transition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"}]}
