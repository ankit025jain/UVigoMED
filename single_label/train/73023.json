{"id":73023,"title":"Analysis of TFRNs associated with steroid hormone-related cancers.","abstract":"Estrogen and androgen are important endocrine hormones that control physiological functions in reproductive organs and play roles in the generation and/or progression of steroid hormone-related cancers. Their cognate receptors function as hormone-dependent transcription factors, which directly regulate the expression of their target genes. Genome-wide analysis of hormone receptor-related networks will provide new insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanism orchestrated by estrogen and androgen receptors, and will enable the development of new methods for the diagnosis and treatment of steroid hormone-related cancers.
