{"id":43875,"title":"[Optimized extraction technology of flavonoid compounds with anti-SMMC-7721 tumor activities in bark of Juglans mandshurica by orthogonal experimental design based on dose-effect fusion evaluation method].","abstract":"To optimize the extraction technology of total flavonoids with antineoplastic activities in Juglans mandshurica, and explore the correlation between total flavonoids and pharmacodynamics indicators.The quantity of antineoplastic components, ratio of extraction and cell inhibition rate were taken as the comprehensive indexes to optimize the main factors that influence the extraction of effective components by orthogonal experiment design. SPSS 17.0 software was used to analyze the Pearson correlation between effective components and pharmacodynamics indexes.The best extracting condition of total flavonoids were as follows: the ratio of 60% ethanol to Juglans mandshurica was 20: 1, extracting for 3 times, each time for 2 hour at 70 degrees C. Flavonoids extraction yield and cell inhibition rate was positively related in the straight line.This study provides a new insight into the optimization of extraction technology for traditional Chinese medicine, and lays a safe and reliable experimental basis for the clinical application of Juglans mandshurica.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System
