{"id":42245,"title":"Experience of managing complicated diverticulitis of colon: a retrospective case series from South Asian country.","abstract":"To assess the morbidity and mortality associated with complicated diverticulitis in Pakistan.The retrospective case series was conducted at an urban tertiary care university hospital of Karachi, Pakistan, comprising data from December 1989 to November 2010. International Classification of Diseases codes for diverticular disease and diverticulitis with abscess, fistula, stricture, bowel obstruction and perforation were obtained from the medical record department. SPSS 19 was used for statistical analysis.A total of 60 (1.9%) cases with complicated diverticulitis were located from among 3170 records reviewed. Mean age was 62.7 +/- 13 years with male-to-female ratio being 36:24. In 37 (62%) patients, the diagnosis was established on computed tomography scan of the abdomen, followed by barium enema in 12 (20%) and colonoscopy in 11 (18%). Post-operative morbidity was observed in 24 (40%) and 7 (16%) expired within 28 days of surgery. Post-operative intra-abdominal sepsis, wound dehiscence and incisional hernia were significantly associated with generalised peritonitis (p < 0.05), while admission to intensive care unit was associated with age over 60 years and faecal peritonitis. Post-operative mortality was significantly associated with high American Society of Anaesthesiologists-score III and IV and age above 60 years.Complicated diverticulitis carries significant morbidity and mortality in Pakistani population. Since the trend is on the rise, therefore we propose a prospective multi-centre cohort study to understand the spectrum of disease, management and identification of risk factors to achieve the best possible outcomes in patients with complicated diverticulitis.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Digestive System
