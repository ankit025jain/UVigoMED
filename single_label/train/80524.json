{"id":80524,"title":"Acaricidal activity of 9-oxo-10,11-dehydroageraphorone extracted from Eupatorium adenophorum in vitro.","abstract":"The acaricidal activity of the 9-oxo-10,11-dehydroageraphorone (euptox A), a cadenine sesquiterpene from Eupatorium adenophorum (E. adenophorum) against Sarcoptes scabiei and Psoroptes cuniculi was tested in vitro. A complementary log-log (CLL) model was used to analyze the data of the toxicity tests in vitro. The results showed euptox A had strong toxicity against mites, killing all S. scabiei at 3 and 4 mg/ml (m/v) concentration, while 4 mg/ml euptox A was also found to kill all P. cuniculi within a 4 h period. Similarly, 2, 3 and 4 mg/ml concentration of euptox A had strong toxicity against S. scabiei, with median lethal time (LT50) values at 0.687, 0.526, 0.326 h, respectively. 3 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml showed strong acaricidal action against P. cuniculi; the LT50 values were 0.693 and 0.493 h, respectively. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 1.068 mg/ml for Scabies mite and 0.902 mg/ml for P. cuniculi in 2 h. The results indicate that euptox A has strong acaricidal activity and may exploit as novel drugs for the effective control of animal acariasis.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631419","annotations":[{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.612649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Acaricide","weight":0.448874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acaricide"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.434781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Scabies","weight":0.390004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies"},{"name":"Sarcoptes scabiei","weight":0.266559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoptes_scabiei"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.181754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Terpene","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Eupatorium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupatorium"},{"name":"Acariasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acariasis"},{"name":"Ageratina adenophora","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageratina_adenophora"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Exploit (computer security)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)"},{"name":"Ketone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"526","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/526"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 687","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_687"},{"name":"Area code 902","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_902"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"},{"name":"Mv","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mv"}]}
