{"id":24975,"title":"Mycophenolate mofetil--a new atheropreventive drug?","abstract":"Atherosclerosis is a form of chronic inflammation in which endothelial cell dysfunction, fibroproliferative process, oxidative stress and inflammatory cell activation are linked to plaque development and destabilization. T-lymphocytes also play a key role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. As a consequence, the suggested concept that modulation of an immunological response could be an appropriate target in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, is an important focus of research. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), that exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apototic effects, particularly on activated T-lymphocytes. MMF has other anti-atherogenic effects at the level of endothelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, smooth muscle cells and dendritic cells. In addition, MMF exhibits anti-oxidative properties. The present review paper provides an overview about the mechanisms of anti-atherosclerotic properties of MMF.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265813","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Mycophenolate mofetil","weight":0.852371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolate_mofetil"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.642772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Inosine","weight":0.490147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inosine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.319916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.302713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.224795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
