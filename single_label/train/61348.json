{"id":61348,"title":"Haematological complete remission by ponatinib and bortezomib in a patient with relapsed, Ph? pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","abstract":"A 74-year-old man was previously diagnosed with BCR-ABL1-positive pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B ALL) based on bone marrow cytology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridisation findings. Following a highly complicated hospital course, the patient achieved cytogenetic remission by consolidated chemotherapy and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. He subsequently presented with relapsed pre-B ALL after 3 years in remission. In consideration of his challenging clinical history, he was started on concurrent ponatinib (45 mg daily) and bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) intravenous weekly). The major molecular response was achieved (<0.0893% BCR-ABL1 transcripts) after 3 months. Bone marrow now demonstrates a BCR-ABL1-negative, complete cytogenetic response. The patient continues to do well with mild thrombocytopenia and improved anaemia on bortezomib and 30 mg daily ponatinib. Our experience with a single patient suggests the feasibility of combined targeted therapy with ponatinib and bortezomib. This novel treatment approach achieved clinical remission with a manageable toxicity profile.
