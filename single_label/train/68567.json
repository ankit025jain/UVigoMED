{"id":68567,"title":"Accumulation of FGF9 in prostate cancer correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and induction of VEGF-A expression.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-9 in prostate cancer cells.Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)s and cadherins in LNCaP cells by incubation with FGF9 was assessed by western blot analysis. Tissues obtained during a radical prostatectomy in 88 patients were immunohistochemically-stained using anti-FGF9, anti-cadherin, and anti-VEGF antibodies.Expression of N-cadherin and VEGF-A were induced in LNCaP cells incubated in FGF9-containing medium. The biochemical relapse-free survival rate in cases with FGF9, N-cadherin and VEGF-A-positive cells was significantly lower than the rate in cases where positive cells were not detectable. The prevalence of both VEGF-A- and N-cadherin-positive cells in the sample with FGF9-positive cells were significantly higher in comparison to FGF9-negative cases.FGF9 can be associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion by inducing VEGF-A expression in prostate cancer cells.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511001","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cadherin","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadherin"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.707819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.69143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.686102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.613738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.519937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.468822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.388766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.240173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.164214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"LNCaP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNCaP"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
