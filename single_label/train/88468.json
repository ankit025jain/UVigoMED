{"id":88468,"title":"[Treatment of severe displaced proximal humeral fractures with titanium elastic nails in older children].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of titanium elastic nails for severe displaced proximal humeral fractures in older children.Between April 2009 and July 2012, 31 cases of severe displaced proximal humeral fractures were treated with closed or open reduction and fixation with 2 titanium elastic nails, and the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. There were 23 boys and 8 girls, aged from 10 to 15 years (mean, 12.8 years). The causes of injury were sports injury (16 cases), traffic accident (11 cases), and falling from height (4 cases). The interval from injury to operation was 6 hours to 7 days (mean, 72 hours). According to Neer-Horwitz classification, 17 cases were rated as type III fracture and 14 cases as type IV fracture. There were 21 cases of metaphyseal fractures and 10 cases of epiphyseal fractures.Satisfactory reduction of fracture and stable fixation were obtained in all patients (closed reduction in 23 cases and open reduction in 8 cases). Primary healing was achieved in all incisions; no infection and neurovascular injury occurred. All patients were followed up 12-36 months with an average of 20 months. X-ray films showed that all fractures healed at 7-10 weeks (mean, 8 weeks). During follow-up, no disturbance of development or angulation deformity caused by premature physeal closure or bone bridge formation was observed. At last follow-up, the average Neer score of the shoulder was 95.7 (range, 83-100). The appearance and motion of the shoulder were normal. There was no significant difference in the upper extremity length between affected side and contralateral side [(67.68 +/- 2.56) cm vs. (67.61 +/- 2.54) cm; t = 1.867, P = 0.072].Titanium elastic nails for severe displaced humeral fractures in older children is a safe and effective method with a low complication incidence.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Wounds and
