{"id":88776,"title":"Mangiferin regulates interleukin-6 and cystathionine-b-synthase in lipopolysaccharide-induced brain injury.","abstract":"Mangiferin has been extensively applied in different fields due to its anti-inflammatory properties. However, the precise mechanism used by mangiferin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation has not been elucidated. Here, we discuss the potential mechanism of mangiferin during a LPS-induced brain injury. Brain injury was induced in ICR mice via intraperitoneal LPS injection (5 mg/kg). Open- and closed-field tests were used to detect the behaviors of mice, while immunoblotting was performed to measure the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cystathionine-b-synthase (CBS) in the hippocampus after mangiferin was orally administered (p.o.). Mangiferin relieved LPS-induced sickness 6 and 24 h after LPS injection; in addition, this compound suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production after 24 h of LPS induction as well as the downregulation of LPS-induced CBS expression after 6 and 24 h of LPS treatment in the hippocampus. Therefore, mangiferin attenuated sickness behavior by regulating the expression of IL-6 and CBS.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794713","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.853922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.802421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.776194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.644641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.605531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.562161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.541879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.457962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Sickness behavior","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickness_behavior"},{"name":"CBS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Intelligent character recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_character_recognition"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
