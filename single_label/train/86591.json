{"id":86591,"title":"Serum periostin: a novel biomarker for asthma management.","abstract":"Chronic airway inflammation and remodeling are fundamental features of asthma. Even with adequate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment, there are still patients who exhibit Th2/eosinophilic inflammation and develop airflow limitation, a functional consequence of airway remodeling. There are few biomarkers that are applicable in the clinical setting that reflect refractory Th2/eosinophilic inflammation and remodeling of the asthmatic airways. Therefore, establishing such biomarkers is essential for managing patients who suffer from these conditions. This review addresses the importance of serum periostin measurements by describing observations made in a KiHAC multicenter cohort with periostin used as a marker of pulmonary function decline and refractory Th2/eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma receiving long-term ICS treatment. Furthermore, serum periostin could be a companion diagnostic for targeted therapy against refractory Th2/eosinophilic inflammation. Finally, the distinct characteristics of serum periostin as compared to conventional biomarkers are addressed.
