{"id":68044,"title":"[Dapoxetine (Priligy): on demand treatment of premature ejaculation].","abstract":"Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common sexual dysfunction, affecting approximately 20-24% of men. Managing PE has been a challenge for physicians and psycho-sexologists as well because no drug for PE has been approved by European (EMA) or U.S. (FDA) drug agencies. Over the past decade, clinical evidence has emerged indicating a beneficial effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tramadol, penile anesthesia and, in some cases, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 for the treatment of men with PE. A psycho-sexological care helps support. In spite of their efficacy, adverse effects represent the major concern for the chronic use of SSRIs in patients with PE and they may prompt discontinuation from therapy. Dapoxetine, marketed as Priligy, is the first compound developed specially for the treatment of PE, on demand before intercourse. Dapoxetine works by inhibiting the serotonin transporter, increasing serotonin's action at the postsynaptic cleft, and as a consequence promoting ejaculatory delay. Dapoxetine is quickly absorbed and eliminated rapidly from the body. Its fast acting property makes it suitable for the on demand treatment of PE.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564032","annotations":[{"name":"Premature ejaculation","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation"},{"name":"Dapoxetine","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapoxetine"},{"name":"Tramadol","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol"},{"name":"Serotonin transporter","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_transporter"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"European Medicines Agency","weight":0.626825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.595958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.565454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.462569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.341954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Phosphodiesterase","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"},{"name":"CGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGMP-specific_phosphodiesterase_type_5"}]}
