{"id":73563,"title":"The role of preclinical SPECT in oncological and neurological  research in combination with either CT or MRI.","abstract":"Preclinical imaging with SPECT combined with CT or MRI is used more and more frequently and has proven to be very useful in translational research. In this article, an overview of current preclinical research applications and trends of SPECT combined with CT or MRI, mainly in tumour imaging and neuroscience imaging, is given and the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches are described. Today SPECT and CT systems are often integrated into a single device (commonly called a SPECT/CT system), whereas at present combined SPECT and MRI is almost always carried out with separate systems and fiducial markers to combine the separately acquired images. While preclinical SPECT/CT is most widely applied in oncology research, SPECT combined with MRI (SPECT/MRI when integrated in one system) offers the potential for both neuroscience applications and oncological applications. Today CT and MRI are still mainly used to localize radiotracer binding and to improve SPECT quantification, although both CT and MRI have additional potential. Future technology developments may include fast sequential or simultaneous acquisition of (dynamic) multimodality data, spectroscopy, fMRI along with high-resolution anatomic MRI, advanced CT procedures, and combinations of more than two modalities such as combinations of SPECT, PET, MRI and CT all together. This will all strongly depend on new technologies. With further advances in biology and chemistry for imaging molecular targets and (patho)physiological processes in vivo, the introduction of new imaging procedures and promising new radiopharmaceuticals in clinical practice may be accelerated.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895751","annotations":[{"name":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.526739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Preclinical imaging","weight":0.5,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preclinical_imaging"},{"name":"Translational research","weight":0.413128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_research"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.406987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.395489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.381715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.262524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.225021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Radiopharmacology","weight":0.212143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiopharmacology"},{"name":"Fiduciary marker","weight":0.191123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary_marker"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Today (NBC program)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Purchasing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing"}]}
