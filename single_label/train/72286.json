{"id":72286,"title":"Circulating cell-free cancer-testis MAGE-A RNA, BORIS RNA, let-7b and miR-202 in the blood of patients with breast cancer and benign breast diseases.","abstract":"MAGE-A (melanoma-associated antigen-A) are promising targets for specific immunotherapy and their expression may be induced by the epigenetic factor BORIS.To determine their relevance for breast cancer, we quantified the levels of MAGE-A1, -A2, -A3, -A12 and BORIS mRNA, as well as microRNAs let-7b and miR-202 in pre- and postoperative serum of 102 and 34 breast cancer patients, respectively, and in serum of 26 patients with benign breast diseases and 37 healthy women by real-time PCR. The mean follow-up time of the cancer patients was 6.2 years.The serum levels of MAGE-A and BORIS mRNA, as well as let-7b were significantly higher in patients with invasive carcinomas than in patients with benign breast diseases or healthy women (P<0.001), whereas the levels of miR-202 were elevated in both patient cohorts (P<0.001). In uni- and multivariate analyses, high levels of miR-202 significantly correlated with poor overall survival (P=0.0001). Transfection of breast cancer cells with synthetic microRNAs and their inhibitors showed that let-7b and miR-202 did not affect the protein expression of MAGE-A1.Based on their cancer-specific increase in breast cancer patients, circulating MAGE-A and BORIS mRNAs may be further explored for early detection of breast cancer and monitoring of MAGE-directed immunotherapies. Moreover, serum miR-202 is associated with prognosis.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983365","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.355214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.269337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.267187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.140536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Breast disease","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"}]}
