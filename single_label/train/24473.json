{"id":24473,"title":"Stroke in community-acquired bacterial meningitis: a Danish population-based study.","abstract":"Stroke is a serious complication in community-acquired bacterial meningitis (CABM), but the incidence, predispositions, and outcome need further clarification; this pertains in particular to the impact of pre-existing atherosclerosis risk factors. Therefore, we aimed to assess these features in a retrospective population-based cohort study.We included all patients over 16 years of age with CABM in North Denmark Region, 1998-2010. All data were retrieved from the patient records. A Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-4 was defined as an unfavourable outcome and 5 as favourable.We identified 152 episodes of CABM. In 22 (14%) of the episodes, the patient had a stroke; 15 strokes were ischaemic, three were haemorrhagic, and four were a combination of both. Age and atherosclerosis risk factors were not significantly associated with stroke. However, stroke was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality (27% vs. 16%; age adjusted risk ratio (age aj. RR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-3.04), unfavourable outcome (86% vs. 37%; age adj. RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.59-2.75), and long-term sequelae among survivors (88% vs. 40%, age adj. RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.53-2.65) compared with patients without stroke.Stroke is a common complication among adult CABM patients and is associated with long-term sequelae and possibly also death. However, stroke seemed not to be related to atherosclerosis risk factors.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433981","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.721754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.576919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.509082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Bacterial meningitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_meningitis"},{"name":"North Denmark Region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Denmark_Region"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"592","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/592"},{"name":"673","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/673"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Clarification and stabilization of wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarification_and_stabilization_of_wine"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"}]}
