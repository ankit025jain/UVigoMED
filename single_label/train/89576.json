{"id":89576,"title":"Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.","abstract":"The application of percutaneous techniques for the management of thoracolumbar fractures is gaining popularity. Short-segment or long-segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation can be used to treat a wide variety of thoracolumbar fractures in patients who are neurologically normal. This approach provides internal fixation, allowing the fracture to heal and sparing the motion segments above and below the fracture, as the instrumentation can be removed later.
