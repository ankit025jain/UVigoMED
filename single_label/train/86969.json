{"id":86969,"title":"Chickenpox in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"A number of chickenpox cases, occurring especially in children, indicates the rationale for the use of chickenpox vaccinations. In Poland since 2002, chickenpox vaccination is included in the National Immunisation Programme as recommended.To assess epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2012 in comparison to previous years.The descriptive analysis was based on data retrieved from routine mandatory surveillance system and published in the annual bulletins \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2012\" (Czarkowski MP i in., Warszawa 2013, NIZP-PZH i GIS). National Immunisation Programme for year 2012 was also used.In 2012, 208 276 cases of chickenpox were registered in Poland. The highest number of cases was reported in ?l?skie voivodeship, the lowest in Podlaskie voivodeship. Mumps incidence was 540.5 per 100 000 and was higher than in 2011 (448.7). The highest incidence was recorded in children aged 4 years (7 611.5 per 100 000). The chickenpox incidence among men (570.7) was higher than among women (512.2). The incidence among rural residents (553.9) was higher than among urban residents (531.8). Number of cases hospitalized due to mumps was 1 361. Number of people vaccinated against chickenpox was 56 213.In 2012, there was an increase in the incidence of smallpox in Poland. This trend is continuing since 2004, which can be partly explained by improved surveillance of the disease.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135499","annotations":[{"name":"Chickenpox","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Mumps","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.731134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Geographic information system","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Warsaw","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Voivodeship","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeship"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"531","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/531"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"553","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/553"},{"name":"570","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/570"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"208","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/208"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"448","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/448"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Podlaskie Voivodeship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podlaskie_Voivodeship"}]}
