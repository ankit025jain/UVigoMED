{"id":13921,"title":"Protective effect of Thunbergia laurifolia (Linn.) on lead induced acetylcholinesterase dysfunction and cognitive impairment in mice.","abstract":"Thunbergia laurifolia (linn., TL), a natural phenolic compound, has been reported to have many benefits and medicinal properties. The current study ascertains the total phenolic content present in TL aqueous leaf extract and also examines the antioxidant ability of the extract in preserving acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of mice exposed to lead in vivo and in vitro model. Mice were given lead acetate (Pb) in drinking water (1 g/L) together with TL 100 and 200 mg/kg/day. The result showed that Pb induced AChE dysfunction in both in vitro and in vivo studies. TL significantly prevented Pb induced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner which was indicated by comparatively better performance of TL treated mice in Morris Water Maze Swimming Test and increased AChE activity in the tissue sample collected from the brains of these mice. TL also exhibited the greatest amount of phenolic content, which has a significant positive correlation with its antioxidant capacity (P < 0.05). Taken together, these data suggested that the total phenolic compounds in TL could exhibit antioxidant and in part neuroprotective properties. It may play a potential treatment strategy for Pb contamination.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455676","annotations":[{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.805364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.803149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.744733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.646472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Phenolic compounds in wine","weight":0.640126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenolic_compounds_in_wine"},{"name":"Phenols","weight":0.634577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenols"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.631935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.575724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.563085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.419741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.256173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.238635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.208017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Morris water navigation task","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_water_navigation_task"},{"name":"Lead(II) acetate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_acetate"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
