{"id":63852,"title":"Thrombocytosis in a patient with systemic lupus.","abstract":"Systemic lupus is an autoimmune disease of worldwide distribution. The disease is characterized clinically by multisystem manifestations. Haematological manifestations are diverse. Thrombocytosis has rarely been reported in association with SLE and may occur as a result of active disease or reactive due to underlying inflammatory process. Our patient was a 14 years old female who was diagnosed as having systemic lupus and had thrombocytosis which persisted despite control of the underlying disease with corticosteroids. Persistent thrombocytosis raised the possibility of Hyposplenism which was confirmed by peripheral smears and radiological investigations. Patient was given appropriate vaccinations in order to prevent the risk of sepsis in a hyposplenic patient.","date":"2014-01-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392567","annotations":[{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.360173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hyposplenism","weight":0.0994642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyposplenism"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}]}
