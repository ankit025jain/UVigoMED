{"id":89923,"title":"Treatment of complex intercondylar humeral fractures in adolescents by open reduction and internal fixation through the transolecranon approach.","abstract":"This is a review of six cases of complex intercondylar fractures of the humerus in adolescents, treated operatively through a transolecranon approach. Outcome was assessed by means of the Mayo Elbow score, the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, and the Oxford Elbow score. All patients reported 'good' to 'excellent' results. One patient required revision surgery because of fracture nonunion, and all patients underwent removal of hardware from the olecranon after osteotomy union. The transolecranon approach is effective in visualization of complex intercondylar fractures, and good outcomes are expected following stable surgical fixation in adolescents.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667148","annotations":[{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.80816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Olecranon","weight":0.536921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.53453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.438568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.423481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.141193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.0809308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Oxford","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
