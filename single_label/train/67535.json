{"id":67535,"title":"[Inhibitory effect of 2'-hydroxyflavanone on proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells in vitro via blocking AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway].","abstract":"To study the effect of 2'-hydroxyflavanone on proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells and its mechanism.MTT assay was used to detect the effect of 2'-hydroxyflavanone on proliferation of bladdercancer cells, and the proliferation inhibition rate was calculated. Wound healing assay and Transwell (TM); assay were conducted to study the effect of 2'-hydroxyflavanone on migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells, respectively. Western blotting was performed to investigate the change of migration-associated proteins after 2'-hydroxyflavanone treatment.2'-hydroxyflavanone inhibited the proliferation of bladder cancer cells (5637, T24, UMUC-3, 253J) in a time- and dose- dependent manner. The migration and invasion abilities of T24 cells were significantly reduced by 2'-hydroxyflavanone treatment (P<0.05), which was accompanied by the down-regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9, p-AKT and p-STAT3 protein expressions.2'-hydroxyflavanone can effectively inhibit bladder cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration, in which the inhibition of AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway may play an important role.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606737","annotations":[{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.643117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.610369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.536871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.475373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.416564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.411427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
