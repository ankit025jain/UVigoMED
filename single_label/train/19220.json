{"id":19220,"title":"Tuberculosis and HIV at the national level in Kenya: results from the Second Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey.","abstract":"Co-morbidity with tuberculosis and HIV is a common cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. In the second Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, we collected data on knowledge and experience of HIV and tuberculosis, as well as on access to and coverage of relevant treatment services and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kenya.A national, population-based household survey was conducted from October 2012 to February 2013. Information was collected through household questionnaires, and blood samples were taken for HIV, CD4 cell counts, and HIV viral load testing at a central laboratory.Overall, 13,720 persons aged 15-64 years participated; 96.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.3 to 97.1] had heard of tuberculosis, of whom 2.0% (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.2) reported having prior tuberculosis. Among those with laboratory-confirmed HIV infection, 11.6% (95% CI: 8.9 to 14.3) reported prior tuberculosis. The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed HIV infection in persons reporting prior tuberculosis was 33.2% (95% CI: 26.2 to 40.2) compared to 5.1% (95% CI: 4.5 to 5.8) in persons without prior tuberculosis. Among those in care, coverage of ART for treatment-eligible persons was 100% for those with prior tuberculosis and 88.6% (95% CI: 81.6 to 95.7) for those without. Among all HIV-infected persons, ART coverage among treatment-eligible persons was 86.9% (95% CI: 74.2 to 99.5) for persons with prior tuberculosis and 58.3% (95% CI: 47.6 to 69.0) for those without.Morbidity from tuberculosis and HIV remain major health challenges in Kenya. Tuberculosis is an important entry point for HIV diagnosis and treatment. Lack of knowledge of HIV serostatus is an obstacle to access to HIV services and timely ART for prevention of HIV transmission and HIV-associated disease, including tuberculosis.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732814","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.734551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.703707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.65237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.647628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.510532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.418419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.360544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.156166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Leptospirosis","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
