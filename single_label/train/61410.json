{"id":61410,"title":"CNS intravascular lymphoma: an underappreciated cause of rapidly progressive dementia.","abstract":"Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of extranodal large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is usually seen in the elderly. It can occasionally present with neurological symptoms in the form of dementia, focal neurological deficit and seizure. Diagnosis is difficult because of non-specific clinical manifestation. We report a case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with rapidly progressive dementia and seizure. MRI of the brain showed bilateral diffuse involvement of cortex and subcortical white matter. Brain biopsy disclosed the aetiological confirmation of intravascular B-cell lymphoma. The patient was treated with monthly cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone regimen, but unfortunately, she died after two chemotherapy cycles. So, high index of suspicion is warranted to diagnose and treat the condition early to have a better outcome.
