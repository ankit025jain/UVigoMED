{"id":53746,"title":"Complete resolution of hypercortisolism with sorafenib in a patient with advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma and ectopic ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) syndrome.","abstract":"The treatment of advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has evolved significantly over the past decade. The discovery of genetic abnormalities in MTC has led to the development of targeted therapies such as vandetanib and cabozantinib. Other kinase inhibitors (KI), such as sorafenib, have been investigated in this setting and are an alternative therapeutic option. The lack of specificity of these KIs to a single target may result in additional, unexpected effects. In this report, we describe a patient with metastatic MTC and Ectopic ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) Syndrome in whom treatment with sorafenib resulted in complete resolution of hypercortisolism.A 45-year-old male with progressive metastatic MTC presented with clinical manifestations suspicious for Cushing's syndrome. Investigation revealed ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism suggestive of Ectopic ACTH Syndrome. Treatment with sorafenib 400?mg twice a day was initiated resulting in a rapid and significant reduction of cortisol and ACTH levels associated with dramatic clinical improvement. The rapid and effective control of hypercortisolism in the absence of a significant tumor reduction raises the question of whether sorafenib may have a direct effect on ACTH or cortisol hypersecretion.This report suggests a previously unknown potential effect of sorafenib on the pituitary-adrenal axis. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the role of sorafenib in other cases of ACTH excess and to understand the mechanisms by which it alters steroid synthesis, action, or secretion.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499195","annotations":[{"name":"Cushing's syndrome","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_syndrome"},{"name":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.749935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.721393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.587362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.584947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.32225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.157444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.153699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Vandetanib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandetanib"},{"name":"Cabozantinib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabozantinib"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adrenal medulla","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_medulla"},{"name":"Potassium iodide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_iodide"}]}
