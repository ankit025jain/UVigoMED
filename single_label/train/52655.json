{"id":52655,"title":"Assessment of serum apelin and lipocalin-2 levels in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.","abstract":"Subclinical hypothyroidism is the precursor to hypothyroidism because it has a tendency to transform into hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is considered one of the risk factors causing metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome can be characterized by plasma levels of apelin and lipocalin-2, both released from adipocytes. In the present study, we aimed to measure serum apelin and lipocalin-2 levels of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and compare them with serum apelin and lipocalin-2 levels from healthy individuals.This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 80 subjects were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: Group A included 39 patients (females, n=34) diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, and Group B (the control group) comprised 41 healthy volunteers (females, n=38). Serum samples were obtained from each participant for the measurement of apelin and lipocalin-2. These were then stored at minus 80Â°C until the time of analysis, when serum apelin and lipocalin-2 levels of the two groups were compared.Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (Group A and Group B subjects [healthy controls]) were comparable with respect to gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.412, P=0.863, and P=0.269, respectively), nor was there a statistically significant difference between groups in terms of apelin and lipocalin-2 levels (P=0.87, and P=0.67, respectively). Apelin levels showed a positive and significant correlation with BMI (P=0.034). Serum lipocalin-2 levels showed significant positive correlations with BMI and creatinine levels (P=0.002, and P=0.025, respectively).In the present study, no significant difference of serum apelin and lipocalin-2 levels was observed between patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and healthy control subjects. Positive correlations were found, however, between serum apelin level and BMI as well as between serum lipocalin-2 and BMI and creatinine levels.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582591","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.815465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.663999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.524632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.404527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Apelin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apelin"},{"name":"Lipocalin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipocalin"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"863","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/863"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
