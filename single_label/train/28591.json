{"id":28591,"title":"Long-term safety and sustained efficacy of extended-release pramipexole in early and advanced Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of pramipexole as a once-daily (q.d.) extended-release oral formulation in early or advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).In two double-blind (DB) studies of early PD and one of advanced PD,active-treatment arms received pramipexole immediate release (IR) or extended release (ER), with exposure lasting up to 33 weeks. In open-label (OL) extensions that followed immediately, subjects took ER q.d. for up to 80 weeks, with dosage adjustment permitted (range 0.375-4.5 mg q.d.).Of 590 subjects completing an early-PD DB study, 511 entered the early-PD OL extension; 408 completed it. Reported adverse events (AEs) with incidence ?10.0% were somnolence (15.1%), peripheral edema (11.7%) and back pain (10.6%). Of 465 subjects completing the advanced-PD DB study, 391 entered the advanced-PD OL extension; 329 completed it. Reported AEs with incidence ?10.0%were dyskinesia (27.4%) and somnolence (13.6%). Impulse control disorders were identified by semi-structured interview in 13 subjects (1.4% of 902). In exploratory analyses, adjusted mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) PartsII + III scores (excluding ex-placebo recipients) remained substantially improved from DB baseline scores prior to pramipexole introduction, at -6.6 and -6.3 points amongst ex-DB-ER and ex-DB-IR recipients after 113 weeks of pramipexole (33 DB plus 80 OL) in early PD, and -11.5 and -9.1 after up to 113 weeks (up to 33 DB plus 80 OL) in advanced PD.These results support the long-term safety and efficacy of pramipexole ER in early and advanced PD. AEs were typical for dopaminergic medications, and UPDRS scores suggested sustained symptomatic benefit.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834511","annotations":[{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.662118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Pramipexole","weight":0.645103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramipexole"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Peripheral edema","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_edema"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.404008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.223991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.139751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Impulse control disorder","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_control_disorder"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"408","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/408"},{"name":"590","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/590"},{"name":"Deutsche Bahn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Area code 902","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_902"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
