{"id":59922,"title":"Chronic eosinophilic leukemia: a rare cause of hypereosinophilic syndrome.","abstract":"Hypereosinophilic syndromes are a wide group of entities. We present a 24-year-old-male with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, elevated eosinophil counts and splenomegaly. Molecular analysis was positive for FIP1LI -PDGFRA gene compatible with chronic eosinophilic leukemia. He was managed with Imatinib producing resolution of the disease.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065049","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.890122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.755469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.538226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hypereosinophilic syndrome","weight":0.32545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereosinophilic_syndrome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"PDGFRA","weight":0.200254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDGFRA"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Eosinophilic","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic"},{"name":"Chronic eosinophilic leukemia","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_eosinophilic_leukemia"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Liberal International","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_International"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"}]}
