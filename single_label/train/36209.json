{"id":36209,"title":"Brugada syndrome ECG is highly prevalent in schizophrenia.","abstract":"The causes of increased risk of sudden cardiac death in schizophrenia are not resolved. We aimed to establish (1) whether ECG markers of sudden cardiac death risk, in particular Brugada-ECG pattern, are more prevalent among patients with schizophrenia, and (2) whether increased prevalence of these ECG markers in schizophrenia is explained by confounding factors, notably sodium channel-blocking medication.In a cross-sectional study, we analyzed ECGs of a cohort of 275 patients with schizophrenia, along with medication use. We determined whether Brugada-ECG was present and assessed standard ECG measures (heart rate, PQ-, QRS-, and QT-intervals). We compared the findings with nonschizophrenic individuals of comparable age (the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety [NESDA] cohort; N=179) and, to account for assumed increased aging rate in schizophrenia, with individuals 20 years older (Hoorn cohort; n=1168), using multivariate regression models. Brugada-ECG was significantly more prevalent in the schizophrenia cohort (11.6%) compared with NESDA controls (1.1%) or Hoorn controls (2.4%). Moreover, patients with schizophrenia had longer QT-intervals (410.9 versus 393.1 and 401.9 ms; both P<0.05), increased proportion of mild or severe QTc prolongation (13.1% and 5.8% versus 3.4% and 0.0% [NESDA], versus 5.1 and 2.8% [Hoorn]), and higher heart rates (80.8 versus 61.7 and 68.0 beats per minute; both P<0.05). The prevalence of Brugada-ECG was still increased (9.6%) when patients with schizophrenia without sodium channel-blocking medication were compared with either of the control cohorts.Brugada-ECG has increased prevalence among patients with schizophrenia. This association is not explained by the use of sodium channel-blocking medication.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591540","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.680856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.587366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.486957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.430537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.403889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.218068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.103201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"QRS complex","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex"},{"name":"Tempo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo"},{"name":"Hoorn","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoorn"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/393"},{"name":"1168","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1168"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Beat (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Quebec","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"}]}
