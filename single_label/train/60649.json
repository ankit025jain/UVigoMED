{"id":60649,"title":"Translocation t(2;11) in CLL cells results in CXCR4/MAML2 fusion oncogene.","abstract":"Recent investigations of chromosomal aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) led to a better understanding of the molecular causes of CLL. Here we report a rearrangement between MAML2 (mastermind-like protein 2) and CXCR4 (specific receptor for CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1) in CLL cells of a patient with a t(2;11)(q22.1;q21) chromosomal translocation. The rearrangement between MAML2 and CXCR4, created by a t(2;11)(q22.1;q21) translocation, results in a new fusion gene in which a portion of CXCR4 is linked to the MAML2 gene. This fusion gene encodes for CXCR4/MAML2 protein chimera in which the N-terminal basic domain of MAML2 is replaced by the N-terminal domain of CXCR4.
