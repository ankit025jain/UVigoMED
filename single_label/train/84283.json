{"id":84283,"title":"[Effect of advanced glycation end products on the function and angiogenesis of adipose tissue-derived stem cells and the protective effect of danhong injection: an experimental study].","abstract":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine albumin (CMLs), a primary advanced glycation end products (AGEPs) isoform in diabetic body, on the function and angiogenesis of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and the protective effect of Danhong Injection (DH). METHODS Human ADSCs were cultured and separated from human subcutaneous fatty tissue using enzymatic digestion and centrifugation. The morphology was observed using optical microscope and differentiation capacities assessed. Cells were exposed to 5 different interventions respectively for 24 h, i.e., PBS, 60 1 microg/mL BSA, 60 microg/mL CML-BSA, 100 microL/mL DH, and 60 micro./mL CML-BSA +100 microL/mL DH. Their effect on the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and secretion were observed using WST-1 assay, Transwell assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI flow meter test reagent kit, human VEGF reagent kit, ELISA reagent kit, respectively. The effect on ADSCs angiogenesis was observed by in vitro angiogenesis test.Compared with the BSA group, the capacities of proliferation and migration could be significantly inhibited by CML-BSA, the apoptosis promoted, the secretion of VEGF reduced, and the angiogenesis of ADSCs weakened (P < 0.05). Compared with the blank control group, 100 microL/mL DH could significantly promote the proliferation and migration capacities of ADSCs, inhibit apoptosis of ADSCs, increase the secretion of VEGF, and improve the angiogenesis of ADSCs (P < 0.05). Compared with the CML-BSA group, the inhibition of CML-BSA on the proliferation and migration capacities of ADSCs could be significantly reversed, the promotion of CML-BSA on the apoptosis of ADSCs improved, the secretion of VEGF increased, and the angiogenesis of ADSCs elevated (P < 0.05).clusion CMLs could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration capacities of ADSCs, promote their apoptosis, and inhibit their angiogeneses, which could be improved by DH.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
