{"id":68720,"title":"Circulating purine compounds, uric acid, and xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase relationship in essential hypertension and end stage renal disease.","abstract":"Purine nucleotide liberation and their metabolic rate of interconversion may be important in the development of hypertension and its renal consequences. In the present study, blood triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) breakdown pathway was evaluated in relation to uric acid concentration and xanthine dehydrogenase/xanthine oxidase (XDH/XO) in patients with essential hypertension, patients with chronic renal diseases on dialysis, and control individuals. The pattern of nucleotide catabolism was significantly shifted toward catabolic compounds, including ADP, AMP, and uric acid in patients on dialysis program. A significant fall of ATP was more expressed in a group of patients on dialysis program, compared with the control value (p<0.001), while ADP and AMP were significantly increased in both groups of patients compared with control healthy individuals (p<0.001), together with their final degradation product, uric acid (p<0.001). The index of ATP/ADP and ATP/uric acid showed gradual significant fall in both the groups, compared with the control value (p<0.001), near five times in a group on dialysis. Total XOD was up-regulated significantly in a group with essential hypertension, more than in a group on dialysis. The activity of XO, which dominantly contributes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, significantly increased in dialysis group, more than in a group with essential hypertension. In conclusion, the examination of the role of circulating purine nucleotides and uric acid in pathogenesis of hypertension and possible development of renal disease, together with XO role in ROS production, may help in modulating their liberation and ROS production in slowing progression from hypertension to renal failure.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502620","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Adenosine diphosphate","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate"},{"name":"Purine","weight":0.821902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine"},{"name":"Xanthine","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.800967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.705162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.692838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Adenosine monophosphate","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.640592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.583329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.524595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Polyphosphate","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphosphate"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.118537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.0501171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"}]}
