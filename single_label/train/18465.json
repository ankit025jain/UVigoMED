{"id":18465,"title":"Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) analysis of Listeria monocytogenes.","abstract":"Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a digest of total genomic DNA. Genomic DNA extracted from a purified bacterial isolate is completely digested with two endonucleases generating fragments which are ligated to specific double-stranded adaptors. The ligated fragments are then amplified by PCR using fluorescently labelled primers. Fluorescent amplified fragments are separated by size on an automated sequencer with a size standard. fAFLP is a rapid, highly reproducible technique which can be used to discriminate and subtype Listeria monocytogenes strains.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792551","annotations":[{"name":"Restriction digest","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_digest"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.790424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.731467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Endonuclease","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonuclease"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Amplified fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplified_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.445974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.345291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.26342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Music sequencer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"DNA extraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction"}]}
