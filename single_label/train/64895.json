{"id":64895,"title":"Phytotherapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A minireview.","abstract":"Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition affecting older men, with an incidence that is age-dependent. Histological BPH, which typically develops after the age of 40 years, ranges in prevalence from >50% at 60 years to as high as 90% by 85 years of age. Typical symptoms include increased frequency of urination, nocturia, urgency, hesitancy, and weak urine stream. Conventional medicines used for the treatment of BPH include alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. This articles review the mode of action, the efficacy, and the safety, including herb-drug interactions of the most common botanicals (Serenoa repens, Pygeum africanum, Urtica dioica, and Cucurbita pepo) and nutraceuticals (isoflavones, lycopene, selenium, and ?-Sitosterol) in controlling the lower urinary tract symptoms associated to BPH.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25165780","annotations":[{"name":"Prunus africana","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_africana"},{"name":"Cucurbita pepo","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita_pepo"},{"name":"Nocturia","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturia"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Serenoa","weight":0.840395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenoa"},{"name":"Stinging nettle","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinging_nettle"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Beta-Sitosterol","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Sitosterol"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Pygeum (herbal remedy)","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygeum_(herbal_remedy)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Isoflavones","weight":0.41889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavones"},{"name":"Phytotherapy","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytotherapy"},{"name":"Nettle","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettle"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Lycopene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Nutraceutical","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutraceutical"},{"name":"Cucurbita","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita"}]}
