{"id":68297,"title":"Design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel heteroaromatic analogs of curcumin as anti-cancer agents.","abstract":"To improve the potential of curcumin to treat advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer, three series (A-C) of heteroaromatic analogs (thirty two compounds) with different monoketone linkers have been synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxicity against two human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145). Among them, thirty analogs are more potent than curcumin against PC-3 cells, and twenty one analogs are more cytotoxic towards DU-145 cells relative to curcumin. The most potent compounds (44, 45, 51, and 52) also showed impressive cytotoxicity against three other metastatic cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and A549), with IC50 values ranging from 50 nM to 390 nM. All four most potent analogs exhibited no apparent cytotoxicity towards the MCF-10A normal mammary epithelial cells. Taken together, selective enhancement of cell death in prostate cancer cell lines and other aggressive cancer cell lines suggests that nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings are promising bioisosteres of the substituted phenyl ring in curcumin.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531225","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.801885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.795552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.729272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.720181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.572164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.570646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.541252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.524765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.458923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"HeLa","weight":0.386382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.219918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Substituent","weight":0.0811588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
