{"id":88018,"title":"Early thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients with blunt solid abdominal organ injuries undergoing nonoperative management: is it safe?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the safety of early (?48 hours), intermediate (48 to 72 hours), and late (?72 hours) venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injury managed nonoperatively.We performed a 6-year (2006 to 2011) retrospective review of all trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injuries. Patients were matched using propensity score matching in a 2:1:1 (early:intermediate:late) for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and type and grade of organs injured. Our primary outcome measures were: hemorrhage complications and need for intervention (operative intervention and/or angioembolization).A total of 116 patients (58 early, 29 intermediate, and 29 late) were included. There were no differences in age (P = .5), Injury Severity Score (P = .6), type (P = .1), and grade of injury of the organ (P = .6) between the 3 groups. There were 67 liver (43.2%), 63 spleen (40.6%), 49 kidney (31.6%), and 24 multiple solid organ (15.4%) injuries. There was no difference in operative intervention (P = .8) and postprophylaxis blood transfusion (P = .3) between the 3 groups.Early enoxaparin-based anticoagulation may be a safe option in trauma patients with blunt solid organ injury. This study showed no significant correlation between early anticoagulation and development of bleeding complications.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928334","annotations":[{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.844821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.789545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.71719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.70516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.475431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
