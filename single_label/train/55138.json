{"id":55138,"title":"Visual outcomes of eyes implanted with a toric multifocal intraocular lens.","abstract":"To investigate the predictability, efficacy, and safety of a ReSTOR multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX).This retrospective, noncomparative case study included 70 eyes of 44 patients implanted with a ReSTOR toric multifocal IOL (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). Patients were examined preoperatively and approximately 3 months postoperatively. Uncorrected and distance-corrected distance and near visual acuities were measured. Refractive and topographic astigmatism were recorded. Improvement, number of lines gained and lost, and correlation of attempted and achieved astigmatic correction values were also investigated as measurements of efficacy, safety, and predictability.Mean follow-up time was 2.3 ± 1.2 months. Postoperative values of uncorrected distance and near visual acuity were 0.02 ± 0.05 logMAR (20/21 ± 20/22 Snellen) and 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (20/20 ± 20/22 Snellen), respectively. Statistical analyses revealed a significant improvement when comparing preoperative and postoperative values of manifest refraction spherical equivalent (P < .0001), uncorrected distance visual acuity (P < .0001), and astigmatism (P < .0001); 95.7% of eyes were 20/25 or better and 100% of eyes were 20/30 or better. At the last follow-up visit, none of the examined eyes had lost any lines. One hundred percent of the eyes remained unchanged or improved after surgery. Mean postoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent was -0.06 ± 0.27 at the last follow-up visit. The residual manifest astigmatism was 0.22 ± 0.21. There was a highly significant correlation between preoperative attempted topographic astigmatism and postoperative achieved refractive astigmatism.The study provides clinical evidence that the new toric multifocal IOL seems to be predictable, safe, and effective, providing satisfactory visual acuity for far and near and correcting astigmatism.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983831","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.727484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.670602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.465351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.453754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Progressive lens","weight":0.407882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_lens"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fort Worth, Texas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas"},{"name":"Alcon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"2021","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021"},{"name":"2022","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022"},{"name":"2025","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
