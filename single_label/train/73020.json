{"id":73020,"title":"Dendritic cells transduced with CPEB4 induced antitumor immune response.","abstract":"Much evidence leads to the exploration of immunologic approaches for eliminating tumor cells. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4) is considered to be a novel therapeutical target for glioblastoma. In this study, we transduced DCs with CPEB4 to explore the immune response in vivo. We found that DCs transduced with recombinant adenovirus encoding CPEB4 could induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to lyse glioma cells and augment the number of IFN-? secreting T-cells in mice. In addition, the modified DCs could effectively protect mice from lethal challenges against glioma cells, reduce tumor growth and increase the mice life span. These results suggest that the DC transduced with CPEB4 may induce anti-tumor immunity against glioma cells and might be used as an efficient tumor vaccine in clinical applications.
