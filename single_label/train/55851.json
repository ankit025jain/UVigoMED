{"id":55851,"title":"Intracameral triamcinolone acetonide in glaucoma surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracameral triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in glaucoma surgery.Prospective randomized clinical trial.Institutional-Wills Eye Hospital.Patients undergoing trabeculectomy (with or without cataract surgery) or tube shunt surgery.Patients were randomized to receive intracameral TA or balanced salt solution at the end of surgery. Follow-up time was 6 months.Intraocular pressure, visual acuity, inflammation measured by slit-lamp examination and laser flare meter, cataract grading, bleb appearance, dry eye scores, use of supplemental medical therapy, surgical success, and rate of complications.Seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the study, including 37 in the TA group and 40 in the control group. There were no significant differences in success rates between the 2 groups (P=.60). Intraocular pressure and medication use were similar between the groups for each follow-up visit. Dry eye scores were lower in the TA group at month 1 (P=.042), while flare scores were higher in the TA group on day 1 (P=.015) but lower at month 1 (P=.044). The complication rates were higher in the TA group on day 1 (P=.04). All other outcome measures were similar for both groups.Intracameral TA did not affect the success rates or change the complication rates of glaucoma surgery.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794283","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.907611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Triamcinolone","weight":0.856854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.801885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.778183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.770604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.65303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.629726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Trabeculectomy","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabeculectomy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.182075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Triamcinolone acetonide","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone_acetonide"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Flare (pyrotechnic)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_(pyrotechnic)"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"}]}
