{"id":35453,"title":"Bilirubin uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase variation is a genetic basis of breast milk jaundice.","abstract":"To evaluate the role of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 1, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) gene variations on prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia associated with breast milk feeding (breast milk jaundice [BMJ]).UGT1A1 gene allelic variation was analyzed in 170 Japanese infants with BMJ with polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing, and their genotypes compared with serum bilirubin concentrations. In 62 of 170 infants, serum bilirubin concentration was followed after 4 months of life. Genotypes were examined in 55 infants without BMJ.Of 170 infants with BMJ, 88 (51.8%) were homozygous UGT1A1*6. Serum bilirubin concentrations (21.8 Â± 3.65 mg/dL) were significantly greater than in infants with other genotypes (P < .0001). The Gilbert UGT1A1*28 allele was not detected in infants with BMJ, except in an infant who was compound heterozygous with UGT1A1*6. At 4 months of age, serum bilirubin concentration improved to >1 mg/dL, except in 2 infants who were homozygous UGT1A1*7. Homozygous UGT1A1*6 was not detected in the control group.One-half of the infants with BMJ were homozygous UGT1A1*6 and exhibited a serum bilirubin concentration significantly greater than other genotypes. This finding indicates that UGT1A1*6 is a major cause of BMJ in infants in East Asia. Previous finding have demonstrated that 5?-pregnane-3?,20?-diol present in breast milk inhibits p.G71R-UGT1A1 bilirubin glucuronidation activity. Thus, prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may develop in infants with UGT1A1*6 who are fed breast milk.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650397","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.827577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glucuronidation","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronidation"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.78087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Human breast milk","weight":0.72334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_breast_milk"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.68381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1","weight":0.651355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_glucuronosyltransferase_1_family,_polypeptide_A1"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Glucuronosyltransferase","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronosyltransferase"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.32551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.134583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Uridine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uridine"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"BMJ","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMJ"},{"name":"Compound heterozygosity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_heterozygosity"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0126761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"}]}
