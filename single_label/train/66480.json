{"id":66480,"title":"Multiparametric MRI identifies and stratifies prostate cancer lesions: implications for targeting intraprostatic targets.","abstract":"To assess the ability of multiparametric (mp) MRI (mp-MRI) to identify, stratify, and localize biopsy-proven prostate cancer lesions in a risk-stratified patient population.We retrospectively analyzed 57 patients who had mp-MRI and core needle biopsy during diagnostic prostate cancer evaluation. The MRI sequences were scored for suspicion of cancer with a previously described system. Distributions of mp-MRI scores were compared across National Comprehensive Cancer Network prostate cancer risk groups. The mp-MRI-identified lesions were compared with the location of positive core needle biopsies to assess mp-MRI localization of true lesions.The mp-MRI scoring system identified lesions in 84% (48/57) of the patients, including 100% (12/12) in the high-risk group. Scores assigned to lesions in patients in intermediate- and high-risk groups were statistically higher than those in the low-risk group, with a relative risk of 6.72 (95% confidence interval: 2.32-19.51, p<0.001) of having an aggressive score assigned in high-risk patients compared with the low-risk patients. In comparing the localization data from core needle biopsy, 68% of the patients had an MRI-identified lesion in or within one adjacent sextant of the same prostate hemigland, including 85% of aggressive lesions.Use of mp-MRI at the time of diagnosis can identify intraprostatic lesions and assign suspicion for high-risk disease. These data show that high-risk patients are more likely to have suspicious imaging-identified lesions that correlate to the location of biopsy-proven prostate cancer. At this time, the use of mp-MRI to define focal targets represents a complementary tool to patient evaluation for focal therapy strategies.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709516","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.644811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.602129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.582679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.530211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.416895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.409281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"National Comprehensive Cancer Network","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Comprehensive_Cancer_Network"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Sextant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant"},{"name":"Melting point","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1212","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1212"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"}]}
