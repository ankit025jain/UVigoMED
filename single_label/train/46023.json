{"id":46023,"title":"Emergency presentation of node-negative colorectal cancer treated with curative surgery is associated with poorer short and longer-term survival.","abstract":"The majority of patients with node-negative colorectal cancer have excellent 5-year survival prospects, but up to a third relapse. Strategies to identify patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes are desirable to enable optimal treatment and follow-up. The aim of this study was to examine postoperative mortality and longer-term survival by mode of presentation for patients with node-negative colorectal cancer undergoing surgery with curative intent.Patients from 16 hospitals in the west of Scotland between 2001 and 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained regional clinical audit database. Postoperative mortality and 5-year relative survival by mode of presentation were recorded.Of 1,877 patients with node-negative disease, 251 (13.4%) presented as an emergency. Those presenting as an emergency were more likely to be older (P?=?0.023), have colon rather than rectal cancer (P?<?0.001), have pT4 stage disease (P?<?0.001), have extramural vascular invasion (P?=?0.001), and receive surgery under the care of a nonspecialist surgeon (P?<?0.001) compared to those presenting electively. The postoperative mortality rate was 3.3% after elective and 12.8% after emergency presentation (P?<?0.001). Five-year relative survival was 91.8% after elective and 66.8% after emergency presentation (P?<?0.001). The adjusted relative excess risk ratio for 5-year relative survival after emergency relative to elective presentation was 2.59 (95% CI 1.67-4.01; P?<?0.001) and 1.90 (95% CI 1.00-3.62; P?=?0.049) after exclusion of postoperative deaths.Emergency presentation of node-negative colorectal cancer treated with curative intent was independently associated with higher postoperative mortality and poorer 5-year relative survival compared to elective presentation.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651957","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Scotland","weight":0.84096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.640491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.451722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.302966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Relative survival","weight":0.0619954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_survival"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Clinical audit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_audit"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
