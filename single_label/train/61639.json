{"id":61639,"title":"Screening for coronary artery disease after mediastinal irradiation in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors: phase II study of indication and acceptanceâ€ .","abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common nonmalignant cause of death in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors, especially after mediastinal irradiation. We investigated the role of computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA) as a screening tool for coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic HL survivors, and related CTA findings to exercise testing and subsequent interventions.Patients were eligible for this phase II study if at least 10 years disease-free and treated with mediastinal radiotherapy. Screening consisted of electrocardiogram, exercise testing and CTA. Primary end point was significant CAD (stenosis >50%) on CTA. CTA screening was considered to be indicated for testing in a larger population if ?6 of 50 CTA scanned patients (12%) would need revascularization. Screening was evaluated with a questionnaire before and after screening.Fifty-two patients were included, and 48 patients underwent CTA. Median age was 47 years, time since HL diagnosis 21 years. There were 45 evaluable scans. Significant CAD on CTA was found in 20% (N = 9), significantly increased compared with the 7% expected abnormalities (P = 0.01, 95% confidence interval 8.3% to 31.7%). In 11% (N = 5), significant stenosis was confirmed at coronary angiography, and revascularization was carried out. Additionally, two patients were treated with optimal medical therapy. Ninety percent of patients were content with screening, regardless whether the CTA showed abnormalities.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692582","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.823103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.780386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.588502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.278431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.249893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.201466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.177599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.158269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
