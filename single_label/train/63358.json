{"id":63358,"title":"SET-NUP214 is a recurrent ?? lineage-specific fusion transcript associated with corticosteroid/chemotherapy resistance in adult T-ALL.","abstract":"The SET-NUP214 (TAF1/CAN) fusion gene is a rare genetic event in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Eleven (6%) of 196 T-ALL patients enrolled in the French Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL) 2003 and 2005 trials harbored a SET-NUP214 transcript. SET-NUP214-positive patients were predominantly (10 [91%] of 11) T-cell receptor (TCR)-negative and strikingly associated with TCR?? lineage T-ALLs, as defined by expression of TCR??, TCR? and/or TCR? rearrangements but no complete TCR? variable diversity joining rearrangement in surface CD3/TCR-negative cases. When compared with SET-NUP214-negative patients, SET-NUP214-positive patients showed a significantly higher rate of corticosteroid resistance (91% vs 44%; P = .003) and chemotherapy resistance (100% vs 44%; P = .0001). All SET-NUP214-positive patients but one achieved complete remission, and 9 were allografted. Despite the poor early-treatment sensitivity, the outcome of SET-NUP214-positive patients was similar to that of SET-NUP214-negative patients.
