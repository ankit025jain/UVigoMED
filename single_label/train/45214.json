{"id":45214,"title":"The natural history of autoimmune hepatitis presenting with jaundice.","abstract":"Forty percent of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) present with acute jaundice/hepatitis. Such patients, when treated promptly, are thought to have a good prognosis.The objective of this study was to describe the natural history of AIH in patients presenting with jaundice/hepatitis and to determine whether the diagnosis could have been made earlier, before presentation.This study is a retrospective review of 2249 consecutive patients who presented with jaundice to the Jaundice Hotline clinic, Truro, Cornwall, UK, over 15 years (1998-2013) and includes a review of the laboratory data over a 23-year period (1990-2013).Of the 955 patients with hepatocellular jaundice, 47 (5%) had criterion-referenced AIH: 35 female and 12 male, the median age was 65 years (range 15-91 years); the bilirubin concentration was 139 ?mol/l (range 23-634 ?mol/l) and the alanine transaminase level was 687 IU/l (range 22-2519 IU/l). Among the patients, 23/46 (50%) were cirrhotic on biopsy; 11/47 (23%) died: median time from diagnosis to death, 5 months (range 1-59); median age, 72 years (range 59-91 years). All 8/11 patients who died of liver-related causes were cirrhotic. Weight loss (P=0.04) and presence of cirrhosis (P=0.004) and varices (P=0.015) were more common among those who died. Among patients who died from liver-related causes, 6/8 (75%) died less than 6 months from diagnosis. Cirrhosis at presentation and oesophageal varices were associated with early liver-related deaths (P=0.011, 0.002 respectively). Liver function test results were available in 33/47 (70%) patients before presentation. Among these patients, 16 (49%) had abnormal alanine transaminase levels previously, and eight (50%) were cirrhotic at presentation.AIH presenting as jaundice/hepatitis was mainly observed in older women: 50% of the patients were cirrhotic, and liver-related mortality was high. Some of these deaths were potentially preventable by earlier diagnosis, as the patients had abnormal liver function test results previously, which had not been investigated.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694760","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.770627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.55743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.549527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.539713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.502821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.308895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.229902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.210525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0530024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cornwall","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
