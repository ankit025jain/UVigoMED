{"id":90349,"title":"[Modern aspects of diagnostics and treatment of orbital fractures].","abstract":"Data on etiology, clinical presentation, and main characteristics of orbital fractures from major Russian and foreign literature sources is reviewed. Features of early and late posttraumatic orbital deformities, such as diplopia, enophthalmos, and hypoglobus, as well as treatment options are described. Capabilities of up-to-date computed tomography in diagnostics of orbital fractures are covered in detail. Data from different authors concerning major problems of orbital reconstruction, treatment tactics, surgical approaches and techniques is provided. Specifics of different materials for orbital walls reconstruction are described, advantages and disadvantages discussed. The absence of a common opinion on these issues among surgeons is accentuated. Possible complications of surgical treatment of orbital fractures are described. Limited use of conservative therapy potential is noted and the necessity of finding new ways of improving diagnostics, planning, and performance of surgical and complex treatment of orbital trauma patients is stressed.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624810","annotations":[{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.467719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.397802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.379135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Enophthalmos","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enophthalmos"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Russians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Doxa","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxa"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
