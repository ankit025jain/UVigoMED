{"id":77185,"title":"Communication about childhood obesity on Twitter.","abstract":"Little is known about the use of social media as a tool for health communication. We used a mixed-methods design to examine communication about childhood obesity on Twitter.NodeXL was used to collect tweets sent in June 2013 containing the hashtag #childhoodobesity. Tweets were coded for content; tweeters were classified by sector and health focus. Data were also collected on the network of follower connections among the tweeters. We used descriptive statistics and exponential random graph modeling to examine tweet content, characteristics of tweeters, and the composition and structure of the network of connections facilitating communication among tweeters.We collected 1110 tweets originating from 576 unique Twitter users. More individuals (65.6%) than organizations (32.9%) tweeted. More tweets focused on individual behavior than environment or policy. Few government and educational tweeters were in the network, but they were more likely than private individuals to be followed by others.There is an opportunity to better disseminate evidence-based information to a broad audience through Twitter by increasing the presence of credible sources in the #childhoodobesity conversation and focusing the content of tweets on scientific evidence.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832138","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.370077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Twitter","weight":0.230556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"},{"name":"Conversation","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation"},{"name":"Human behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.130041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Audience","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Social media","weight":0.092158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Graph (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)"},{"name":"World energy consumption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption"},{"name":"Health communication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_communication"},{"name":"Source criticism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
