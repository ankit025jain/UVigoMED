{"id":78384,"title":"[Differential diagnosis of hoarseness].","abstract":"Hoarseness can be the leading symptom of dysphonia. In combination with impaired vocal performance and subjective voice-related discomfort, it can represent an individually different handicap for patients and lead to limited participation in social and professional life. Since the reasons for dysphonia may be not only functional but also organic with a potentially poor prognosis, hoarseness must be clarified using differential diagnosis. In addition to the knowledge of possible diseases, pathogenesis, and treatment options for dysphonia, the differential diagnostic approach requires profound knowledge of the various diagnostic methods, and of the interpretation of the results in particular. The etiology of dysphonia is very diverse and rarely monocausal. Therefore, a team-based and interdisciplinary differential diagnostic approach is recommended.
