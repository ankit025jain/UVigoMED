{"id":21735,"title":"In vitro culture of a novel genotype of Ehrlichia sp. from Brazil.","abstract":"Ehrlichiae are obligate intracytoplasmic Gram-negative, tick-borne bacteria belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family. Ehrlichioses are considered emerging diseases in both humans and animals. Several members of the genus Ehrlichia have been isolated and propagated in vitro. This study describes the continuous propagation of a Brazilian Ehrlichia sp. isolate in IDE8 tick cells, canine DH82 cells and bovine aorta cells. Initially, the organisms were isolated from the haemolymph of a Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus tick into IDE8 cells. Infected IDE8 cells were brought from Brazil to Germany, where the organisms were continuously propagated in IDE8, DH82 and bovine aorta cells. Bovine aorta cells were infected and propagated for 3 months, corresponding to six subcultures, whereas the other two infected cell lines were kept for more than 1 year. During the cultivation period, 36 and 14 subcultures were carried out in IDE8 and DH82 cell cultures, respectively. Reinfection of IDE8 cells with organisms grown in DH82 cells was achieved. Sequence analysis made with a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene showed that this Ehrlicha sp. is closely related to Ehrlichia canis. However, the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree shows that it falls in a separate phylogenetic clade from E. canis.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589106","annotations":[{"name":"Hemolymph","weight":0.891514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolymph"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Clade","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Phylogenetic tree","weight":0.804172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.521606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.361989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.356024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.355411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.272142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.231809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Plant propagation","weight":0.159155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Tick-borne disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_disease"},{"name":"Ehrlichia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichia"},{"name":"Maximum likelihood","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood"},{"name":"Obligate parasite","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligate_parasite"},{"name":"Canis","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Subculture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture"},{"name":"Hard water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
