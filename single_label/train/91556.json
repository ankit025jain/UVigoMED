{"id":91556,"title":"[Effect of nursing intervention on the prevention of burns in warm needling moxibustion].","abstract":"To explore the effect of nursing intervention on the prevention of burns in warm needling moxibustion.Two hundred patients received warm needling treatment were collected from January to December 2011 and were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 100 cases veceived ten hundreds of treatment in each group. In the control group, the routine nursing was applied in warm needling moxibustion. In the observation group, on the basic method as the control group, the nursing intervention was used. The burns incidence and the satisfaction of patients in warm needling moxibustion were recorded in the patients of the two groups.The burns incidence was 0.6% (6/1000) in the observation group, which was lower apparently than 1. 5% (15/1000) in the control group (P<0. 05). The satisfaction of patients in warm needling moxibustion was 99.0% (99/100) in the observation group, which was higher obviously than 88.0% (88/100) in the control group (P<0. 01).The nursing intervention prevents effectively from burns in warm needling moxibustion, reduces medical injuries, avoids the pains of patients and plays the active role in the patient satisfaction.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494292","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.629809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.461749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.164059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"}]}
