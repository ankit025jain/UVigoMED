{"id":23635,"title":"Two-photon intravital imaging of lungs during anthrax infection reveals long-lasting macrophage-dendritic cell contacts.","abstract":"The dynamics of the lung immune system at the microscopic level are largely unknown because of inefficient methods of restraining chest motion during image acquisition. In this study, we developed an improved intravital method for two-photon lung imaging uniquely based on a posteriori parenchymal tissue motion correction. We took advantage of the alveolar collagen pattern given by the second harmonic generation signal as a reference for frame registration. We describe here for the first time a detailed dynamic account of two major lung immune cell populations, alveolar macrophages and CD11b-positive dendritic cells, during homeostasis and infection by spores of Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax. We show that after alveolar macrophages capture spores, CD11b-positive dendritic cells come in prolonged contact with infected macrophages. Dendritic cells are known to carry spores to the draining lymph nodes and elicit the immune response in pulmonary anthrax. The intimate and long-lasting contacts between these two lines of defense may therefore coordinate immune responses in the lung through an immunological synapse-like process.
