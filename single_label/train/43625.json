{"id":43625,"title":"Establishment of a novel cell line from intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct.","abstract":"Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) is a novel and increasingly-occurring disease. Its characteristics remain uncertain because of the lack of an in vitro culture system. We established and characterized a novel cell line from a human IPNB.We obtained tumor tissue from a surgical specimen from a patient with IPNB. Cells were primary co-cultured with mouse stromal cells in serum-free medium. Tumor characteristics were compared among the primary IPNB, established cell line, and xenograft.We successfully established an IPNB cell line. We temporary termed this cell line Kobe Bile Duct Cancer (KBDC)-11. Xenograft formed a tumor which had ductal structures and mucus production as the primary tumor did. Overexpression of p53, MUC staining pattern, and CD133 expression were common among the primary IPNB, KBDC-11, and the xenograft.This novel cell line established from IPNB exhibited the same features as IPNB and might contribute to studies of IPNB and its process of malignant transformation.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778022","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.778993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.361854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.350708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.271555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.260332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lactiferous duct","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactiferous_duct"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
