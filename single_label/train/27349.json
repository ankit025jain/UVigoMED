{"id":27349,"title":"Repeat coronary computed tomographic angiography in patients with a prior scan excluding significant stenosis.","abstract":"ACCF/SCCT/ACR/AHA/ASE/ASNC/NASCI/SCAI/SCMR 2010 Appropriate Use Criteria for Cardiac Computed Tomography (AUC2010) does not incorporate prior coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) results in the appropriateness of a CCTA examination. The purpose of this study was to explore the criteria for forgoing repeat CCTA among patients with clinical scenarios suggesting CCTA as appropriate after prior CCTA excluding coronary artery disease.Among patients from a single center (February 2006 to April 2013) who underwent appropriate CCTA based on AUC2010, consecutive 555 CCTAs, which had a prior CCTA excluding significant stenosis (>50% stenosis in diameter), were selected. The median time difference between the studies was 34.2 (Q1-Q3, 22.9-50.1) months. Significant stenosis was detected at the time of repeat scan (by CCTA or subsequent catheter angiography) in 13.3% (74 of 555). A multivariable logistic model (C-statistic, 0.74; bootstrapped overfitting bias, 0.8%) identified 3 predictors of significant stenosis: time difference between the studies >3 years (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.5), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval,1.4-4.3), and 26% to 50% stenosis on the initial CCTA (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-9.6). When these 3 factors were all absent (corresponding to 31.9% of the population), the probability of significant stenosis was 4.5% (95% confidence interval, 2.7-7.4%), whereas 17.1% of patients had significant stenosis among those with at least 1 positive variable. When coronary arteries were completely normal at the initial scan, the prevalence of significant stenosis was only 1.8% irrespective of other factors, and no patient underwent revascularization.Nondiabetic patients with a prior CCTA <3 years showing no or ?25% stenosis had a <5% prevalence of significant stenosis. The value of repeat CCTA in this group is likely small, especially when the prior CCTA demonstrated normal coronaries, even if the clinical scenario considered a CCTA appropriate.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25037056","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery
