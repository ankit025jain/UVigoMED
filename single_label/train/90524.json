{"id":90524,"title":"[Case-control study on injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation and injured vertebra bone grafting for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures].","abstract":"To compare the clinical effects of injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation and injured vertebra bone grafting in treating thoracolumbar fractures.A retrospective study was performed on 48 patients with single thoracolumbar fractures (type A3) from August 2008 to August 2010. Twenty-four patients were treated with injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation (group A) and 24 were treated with injured vertebra bone grafting (group B). There were 14 males and 10 females with an average age of (44.0 +/- 7.4) years old (34 to 56) in group A and there were 13 males and 11 females with an average age of (42.5 +/- 7.1) years(ranged, 31 to 54) in group B. Operation time, volume of blood loss, complications and the relative parameter of imageology were compared between two groups.There was no significant difference in gender,age, position of injury, volume of blood loss between two groups. Operation time of group A was shorter than that of group B. Cobb angle and injured vertebral height obviously improved at the immediately postoperatively between two groups; there was no significant difference in group A between the immediately and three months postoperatively, but there was significant difference in group B; there was no significant difference between three months and one year postoperatively in two groups. The failure rate of group B was significantly higher than that of group A.Pedicle screw fixation in the injured vertebrae has advantage of short operation time,can obtain satisfactory effects and is better than injured vertebra bone grafting in maintaining the reduction in treating single thoracolumbar fractures.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605744","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.482045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.46404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.433686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.344756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.117923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Cobb angle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_angle"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"2010 Winter Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
