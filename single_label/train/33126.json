{"id":33126,"title":"The genetics of lissencephaly.","abstract":"Lissencephaly is a spectrum of severe brain malformations caused by the failure of migrating neurons to reach optimal positions in the developing cerebral cortex. Several syndromes associated with lissencephaly have been characterized in recent years. Identification of the genetic basis of these disorders has brought fascinating insights into the mechanisms of brain development, as well as benefits to patients through improved molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling. This review explores the clinical presentation, radiological features, histological findings and molecular basis of lissencephaly with the aim of facilitating the selection and interpretation of gene tests in patients with 'smooth brain' phenotypes.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862549","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.657876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lissencephaly","weight":0.578148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissencephaly"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.298053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.272072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.222105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"}]}
