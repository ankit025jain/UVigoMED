{"id":52783,"title":"Self-management program participation by older adults with diabetes: Chronic Disease Self-Management Program and Diabetes Self-Management Program.","abstract":"The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program and the Diabetes Self-Management Program offer evidence-based self-management for persons with diabetes. We examined participation and completion rates for older adults in the Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative and found that completion is more likely (1) in Diabetes Self-Management Program for individuals with diabetes; (2) for Chronic Disease Self-Management Program and Diabetes Self-Management Program with introductory class zero; and (3) in small classes. We also found that participants reporting depression were less likely to complete either workshop. Future research is needed to examine workshop availability and selection, health and behavioral outcomes, and participant/completer experience.
