{"id":16036,"title":"The Joint Commission cracks down on vial misuse in hospitals.","abstract":"Unsafe injection practices with respect to the misuse and unsafe use of vials is being targeted by The Joint Commission (TJC). The accrediting agency has issued a Sentinel Event Alert, putting hospitals on notice that they need to take strong steps to insure that health care workers fully understand and are carrying out practices that protect patients from the dangers of vial misuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, since 2001, at least 49 outbreaks related to the mishandling of injectable medical products have occurred, and during this time period, more than 150,000 patients have had to be notified to undergo blood-borne pathogen testing because of their potential exposure to unsafe injections. TJC cites a survey of 5,446 health care practitioners, which reveals significant gaps in basic infection control practices related to vial use. Experts suggest vial misuse is often due to a lack of understanding of how to apply safe injection practices. To make improvements, experts recommend that hospital administrators first take steps to observe what is happening in their care environments, and then develop targeted action plans.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076609","annotations":[{"name":"Blood-borne disease","weight":0.821198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-borne_disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Joint Commission","weight":0.337453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Commission"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.263432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.230015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Atlanta","weight":0.114562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta"},{"name":"Health administration","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_administration"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Educational accreditation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_accreditation"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"446","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/446"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"Happening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happening"},{"name":"Alert, Nunavut","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alert,_Nunavut"},{"name":"Penning trap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penning_trap"},{"name":"Vial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vial"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"January Events (Lithuania)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_Events_(Lithuania)"},{"name":"The Joint (music venue)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joint_(music_venue)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
