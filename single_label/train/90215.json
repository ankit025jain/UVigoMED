{"id":90215,"title":"[Pleurisy of unexpected etiology: a foreign body within the pleural cavity].","abstract":"Following three brief clinical reports, we review the literature concerning a rare cause of exudative pleural effusion: the presence of a foreign body in the pleural cavity. Frequently iatrogenical, this rare etiology of pleural effusion must be envisaged when this complication develops after any invasive peri-thoracic surgery and must be included in the differential diagnosis of recurrent pleural effusions. These effusions have a favorable prognosis after withdrawal of the foreign body.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640307","annotations":[{"name":"Pleurisy","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.416632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.416275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.394691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.173369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"}]}
