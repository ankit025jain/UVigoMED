{"id":52453,"title":"Masked and overt autoantibodies specific to the DPD epitope of 65-kDa glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65-DPD) are associated with preserved ?-cell functional reserve in ketosis-prone diabetes.","abstract":"Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD), defined by presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), comprises 4 subgroups based on the presence or absence of islet cell autoantibodies (A(-) or A(+)) and ?-cell functional reserve (?(-) or ?(+)). Among A(+) KPD, autoantibody epitope reactivity to 65-kDa glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65), defined by monoclonal GAD65Ab(DPD), was associated with greater ?-cell functional reserve. In a majority of healthy individuals, GAD65Ab are present in the sera but are masked by anti-idiotypic antibodies; in contrast, overtly GAD65Ab-positive patients with autoimmune type 1 diabetes patients lack these anti-idiotypic antibodies.Our objective was to determine the presence of masked and overt GAD65Ab(DPD) in relation to ?-cell function and genetic risk factors in KPD patients.We investigated the associations of masked and overt GAD65Ab(DPD) with ?-cell functional reserve, and their relationship with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II haplotypes linked to autoimmune diabetes susceptibility or resistance, in a large KPD cohort.Adult KPD patients (n = 384) were followed longitudinally in a research clinic.?-Cell function, autoantibody status, GAD65Ab epitopes, and HLA class II haplotypes were evaluated.Overall, KPD patients with ?-cell functional reserve (?(+) subgroups) showed significantly higher frequency of masked GAD65Ab(DPD) than patients without ?-cell functional reserve (?(-) subgroups): 112 of 144 (79%) compared with 59 of 100 (59%), respectively (P = .002). Masked or overt GAD65Ab(DPD) were also more frequent among autoantibody-positive patients with preserved ?-cell functional reserve (A(+)?(+) KPD) than those lacking ?-cell function (A(+)?(-) KPD): 77% compared with 55% (P = .01). The susceptibility HLA haplotypes DQA1*0301/DQB1*0302 and DQA1*0301/DQB1*0201 were associated with absence of overt or masked GAD65Ab(DPD) (odds Ratios 2.3 and 2.2, respectively).Masked GAD65Ab(DPD) are strongly associated with preserved ?-cell functional reserve among patients with KPD. Absence of GAD65Ab(DPD) reactivity is associated with 2 HLA class II susceptibility haplotypes for autoimmune type 1 diabetes.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601691","annotations":[{"name":"Glutamate decarboxylase","weight":0.918295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_decarboxylase"},{"name":"Diabetic ketoacidosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.769445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.683796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.620804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Ketoacidosis","weight":0.515767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.100192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
