{"id":51384,"title":"Evolution of abnormal plasma glucagon responses to mixed-meal feedings in youth with type 1 diabetes during the first 2 years after diagnosis.","abstract":"To examine the evolution of the dysregulated glucagon responses to mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTTs) in youth with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D).MMTTs were performed in 25 youth (9-18 years of age) with 1.5-12 months disease duration (year 1); 22 subjects were restudied 1 year later (year 2). Twenty nondiabetic (ND) control children were also studied.In T1D children, MMTT-stimulated increases in glucagon were significantly greater than that in ND children (median increments: year 1, 21 pg/mL [16-30]; year 2, 25 pg/mL [16-30]; ND, 9 pg/mL [5-16]; P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively).In comparison with ND control children, exaggerated plasma glucagon responses to mixed-meal feedings are observed in youth with T1D within the first 2 years of diagnosis. Further studies to determine whether suppression of these abnormal responses may help to improve glycemic control are warranted.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696460","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.423569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glucagon","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.252612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0311801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"North Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota"},{"name":"1630","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1630"},{"name":"1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1"},{"name":"918","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/918"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0156704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
