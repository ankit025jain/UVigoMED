{"id":66846,"title":"Contrast-induced nephropathy in aged critically ill patients.","abstract":"Aging is associated with renal structural changes and functional decline. The attributable risk for renal dysfunction from radiocontrast agents in critically ill older patients has not been well established.In this prospective study, we assessed the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in critically ill patients with stable renal function who underwent computed tomography with intravenous contrast media. Patients were categorized into two age groups: <65 (YG) or ? 65 years old (OG). CIN was defined as 25% or greater increase from baseline of serum creatinine or as an absolute increase by 0.5 mg/dL until the 5th day after the infusion of contrast agent. We also evaluated the alterations in oxidative stress by assessing serum 8-isoprostane.CIN occurred in 5 of 13 OG patients (38.46%) whereas no YG patient presented CIN (P = 0.015). Serum creatinine kinetics in older patients demonstrated a rise over five days following contrast infusion time while a decline was observed in the YG (P = 0.005).Older critically ill patients are more prone to develop renal dysfunction after the intravenous infusion of contrast agent in relation to their younger counterparts.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672639","annotations":[{"name":"Radiocontrast","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.85059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.523122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.454175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.376457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.3352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.323358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.160274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
