{"id":45144,"title":"Nutritional management of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome.","abstract":"To summarize the latest information on the nutritional management of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), focusing on the foods implicated and how to avoid these whilst maintaining a nutritionally sound diet.A number of foods are implicated in FPIES such as milk, soy and grains, particularly rice. The number of foods implicated in FPIES per individual differs, but the majority of reported cases have two or fewer food triggers involved.FPIES is a complex presentation of non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Dietary management is complicated as both common food allergens as well as atypical food allergens can trigger FPIES. Sound nutritional advice is required to ensure appropriate food avoidance, adequate consumption of other foods and sufficient nutritional intake to maintain and ensure growth and development.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699338","annotations":[{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Soybean","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"},{"name":"Cereal","weight":0.542338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.468799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.280357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Food intolerance","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Enterocolitis","weight":0.0184336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
