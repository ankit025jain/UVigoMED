{"id":69225,"title":"Clinical prognostic factors and survival outcome in renal cell carcinoma patients--a malaysian single centre perspective.","abstract":"This study concerns clinical characteristics and survival of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients in University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), as well as the prognostic significance of presenting symptoms.The clinical characteristics, presenting symptoms and survival of RCC patients (n=151) treated at UMMC from 2003-2012 were analysed. Symptoms evaluated were macrohaematuria, flank pain, palpable abdominal mass, fever, lethargy, loss of weight, anaemia, elevated ALP, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytosis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of these presenting symptoms. Kaplan Meier and log rank tests were employed for survival analysis.The 2002 TNM staging was a prognostic factor (p<0.001) but Fuhrman grading was not significantly correlated with survival (p=0.088). At presentation, 76.8% of the patients were symptomatic. Generally, symptomatic tumours had a worse survival prognosis compared to asymptomatic cases (p=0.009; HR 4.74). All symptoms significantly affect disease specific survival except frank haematuria and loin pain on univariate Cox regression analysis. On multivariate analysis adjusted for stage, only clinically palpable abdominal mass remained statistically significant (p=0.027). The mean tumour size of palpable abdominal masses, 9.5±4.3cm, was larger than non palpable masses, 5.3±2.7cm (p<0.001).This is the first report which includes survival information of RCC patients from Malaysia. Here the TNM stage and a palpable abdominal mass were independent predictors for survival. Further investigations using a multicentre cohort to analyse mortality and survival rates may aid in improving management of these patients.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460324","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.654509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.597426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.588739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.571584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.44725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.287499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Abdominal mass","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_mass"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.180511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Hypoalbuminemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalbuminemia"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"}]}
