{"id":62027,"title":"MATILDE chemotherapy regimen for primary CNS lymphoma: results at a median follow-up of 12 years.","abstract":"We report updated results at a median follow-up of 12 years of a phase II trial assessing first-line MATILDE chemotherapy and response-tailored radiotherapy in patients with primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL).Forty-one HIV-negative patients (18-70 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ?3) with histologically confirmed PCNSL received 3 courses of MATILDE chemotherapy followed by whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Chemotherapy activity was the primary endpoint.Overall response rate was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 63%-89%) after chemotherapy and 83% (95% CI 71%-95%) after chemotherapy ± radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 144 months (range 47-153), 31 patients experienced an event: relapse in 24, progressive disease in 3, and toxic death in 4, with a 5-year progression-free survival of 24% ± 8%. Two patients experienced a late relapse (100 and 101 months). Nine patients are alive and disease-free, 8 of whom are alive at >10 years, with a 5-year overall survival of 30% ± 7%. At 10 years from diagnosis, no patient showed chronic hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of ?29 in all cases but one.At a median follow-up of 12 years, MATILDE regimen followed by WBRT confirmed the previously reported survival plateau, which further proves its long-lasting efficacy with acceptable neurologic deficits.This study provides Class IV evidence that in patients with PCNSL, MATILDE chemotherapy followed by response-tailored radiotherapy increases the probability of disease remission at 12 years.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634458","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.745397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma","weight":0.627859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_central_nervous_system_lymphoma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.381251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.286659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.263456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.193355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.127538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cooperative_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
