{"id":67903,"title":"The Glu298Asp polymorphism in the NOS3 gene and the risk of prostate cancer.","abstract":"The Glu298Asp polymorphism in the NOS3 gene has been implicated as a risk factor for prostate cancer. To date, several studies have evaluated the associations between the Glu298Asp polymorphism and prostate cancer risk; however, the results were inconclusive. The aim of the current study was to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the association between the polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer. A total of 3,206 cases and 3,880 controls from eight case-control studies were included for data synthesis. The overall results suggested no significant association between the polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.92-1.11, p?=?0.83 for Asp/Asp+Glu/Asp vs. Glu/Glu). In the stratified analysis according to ethnicity, no significant associations were observed in Asians and Europeans. The current meta-analysis suggested that the Glu298Asp polymorphism of the NOS3 gene might not contribute to the risk of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577889","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.746632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.67526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.538961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.536507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.497399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.295852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Nitrous oxide","weight":0.223991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0436208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Endothelial NOS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_NOS"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"921","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/921"},{"name":"298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/298"},{"name":"880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/880"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
