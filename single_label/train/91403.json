{"id":91403,"title":"Delayed massive hemothorax complicating simple rib fracture associated with diaphragmatic injury.","abstract":"Traumatic hemothorax is potentially life threatening. Rib fractures are the commonest injury after chest trauma, which accounts for 10% of patients after trauma. A delayed massive hemothorax after simple rib fracture is rare. The possibility of delayed sequelae after chest trauma should be considered, and patients should be informed of this possibility. We present a case of this uncommon situation with delayed massive hemothorax caused by simple fracture of the lower ribs. Admission should be considered for close observation when presenting with fracture of the lower ribs because of the possibility of diaphragmatic injury or intra-abdominal injury, even if a simple rib fracture is found initially.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507452","annotations":[{"name":"Rib fracture","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.411024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Hemothorax","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemothorax"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.206125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
