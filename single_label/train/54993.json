{"id":54993,"title":"Additive Effect of preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.1% in treatment of dry eye syndrome with diquafosol 3% eye drops.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment effect of diquafosol 3% with preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.1% eye drops in dry eye syndrome.In total, 150 patients with dry eye syndrome were divided randomly into 3 groups. Group 1 (50 patients) was treated 4 times daily with preserved sodium hyaluronate 0.1%, group 2 (50 patients) was treated 4 times daily with diquafosol 3%, and group 3 (50 patients) was treated 4 times daily with diquafosol 3% and preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.1% eye drops for 3 months. Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score, tear film break-up time, Schirmer I test, corneal fluorescein staining, and impression cytology were evaluated.There were significant improvements in the OSDI score, tear film break-up time, Schirmer I score, fluorescein and Rose Bengal staining, goblet cell density, and impression cytological findings in groups 2 and 3 compared with those for group 1 in patients with dry eye syndrome at 1, 2, and 3 months (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant improvements in the OSDI score (-8.48 ± 0.97, -5.69 ± 0.78; P = 0.02), fluorescein (-1.43 ± 0.21, -1.02 ± 0.18; P = 0.03), and Rose Bengal staining (-1.12 ± 0.26, -0.75 ± 0.12; P = 0.03), goblet cell density (89.65 ± 14.39, 70.36 ± 16.75; P = 0.03), and impression cytological findings (-0.53 ± 0.12, -0.34 ± 0.90; P = 0.01) in group 3 compared with those in group 2 at 3 months.Treatment with diquafosol 3% with preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.1% was more effective than diquafosol 3% monotherapy or treatment with preserved sodium hyaluronate 0.1% in dry eye syndrome. Preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.1% eye drops can increase the effect of diquafosol 3% in dry eye syndrome.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055152","annotations":[{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.694783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.685203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.582396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.535589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.441559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Rose bengal","weight":0.417693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_bengal"},{"name":"Goblet cell","weight":0.413707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.347898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"G.
