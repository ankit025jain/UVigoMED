{"id":71188,"title":"[Re-entrainment to physical activity in the global management of breast cancer: pilot study in a mono-institutional experience].","abstract":"The objective of the present study is to report the pilot experience at the \"Loire cardiorespiratory readaptation center\" of re-entrainment of physical activity for patients suffering from breast cancer. Between January 2012 and February 2013, 63 patients took the program at the readaptation center. The program is composed of three sessions a week during seven weeks. During the care, a medical team intervenes. It is composed of a cardiologist, a physiotherapist, a sophrologist, a psychologist and a dietician who take part in turns and/or together. During the first session of the program, the warm-up power chosen on the exercise bike was on average of 14.72 watts (min?=?5; max?=?30), and it went up to 44.84 watts (min?=?15; max?=?85) on average during the last session. The maximal power used by the patient was on average of 39.08 watts (min?=?10; max?=?70) during the first session. On the last day of training, the average maximal power between the patients was of 76.03 watts (min?=?30; max?=?110). The tests used into practice tend to confirm a physical progression between the beginning and the end of the re-training program. This study particularly shows that it is possible today to propose this type of program to the patients in daily practice.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091652","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Psychologist","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.530849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.525739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.365988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.35035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.333035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.276152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Medicine in medieval Islam","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_in_medieval_Islam"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Stationary bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_bicycle"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Center (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_football)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Watt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt"},{"name":"Retraining","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraining"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Loire","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire"}]}
