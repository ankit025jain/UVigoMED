{"id":41117,"title":"Efficacy and safety of esomeprazole with flupentixol/melitracen in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with emotional disorders.","abstract":"This study was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of esomeprazole combined with flupentixol/melitracen for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients with emotional disorders. METHODS Two hundred eighty-nine GERD patients with emotional disorders were divided randomly into two groups: group 1 received esomeprazole only (monotherapy) and group 2 received esomeprazole and flupentixol/melitracen (combination therapy). The patients' GERD questionnaire (GerdQ) and hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scores were obtained before and after treatment. Changes in the scores, rates of symptom remission, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups.After 2 weeks of treatment, the average decrease in GerdQ score in the combination group (4.04 ± 2.34) was significantly greater than that in the monotherapy group (3.34 ± 2.74; P < 0.05). Significant differences between the two groups were also found for changes in HAD anxiety scores (5.45 ± 2.41 vs 3.34 ± 2.43, P < 0.05), depression scores (5.47 ± 2.47 vs 3.00 ± 3.28, P < 0.05), and anxiety-depression scores (5.20 ± 2.71 vs 3.60 ± 2.56, P < 0.05). The remission of symptoms (eructation, abdominal pain, anorexia, and other accompanying symptoms) in the combination group was significantly better than that in the monotherapy group, and no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was observed between the two groups.The combination therapy has better efficacy than the monotherapy in improving the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with emotional disorders. In addition, this combination treatment is safe, with a low incidence of adverse events.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955450","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.74998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.710558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.49134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.261899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Esomeprazole","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Emotional and behavioral disorders","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_and_behavioral_disorders"},{"name":"Belching","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belching"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
