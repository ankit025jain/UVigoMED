{"id":4887,"title":"Seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus in two localities in the state of Morelos, Mexico.","abstract":"Humoral immune response against dengue virus (DENV) is an important component in dengue-endemic transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional nested cohort study to determine the seroprevalence and frequency of neutralizing antibodies against DENV serotypes in two endemic localities in the state of Morelos, Mexico. The cohort participants (N = 1,196) were screened to determine previous exposure to DENV. Overall seroprevalence was 76.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 73.6-79.2), and prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in the 5- to 9-year-old group was 82.5% (95% CI = 67.2-92.7), 45% (95% CI = 29.3-61.5), and 65% (95% CI = 48.3-79.4) for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, respectively. For participants older than 10 years, the observed seroprevalence was above 60% for each serotype, except DENV-4 in the 10- to 25-year-old group (42.9%); 81% of humoral responses were multitypic. The outcomes of our study contribute to understanding the immune component of dengue transmission and provide focal information for the evaluation of vaccine candidates under development.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294613","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.847873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.603533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.426182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.387592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Dengue virus","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Morelos","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morelos"},{"name":"Denver Gold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Gold"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"379","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/379"},{"name":"679","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/679"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
