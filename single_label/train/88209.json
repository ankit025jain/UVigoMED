{"id":88209,"title":"Open reduction and closed reduction internal fixation in treatment of femoral neck fractures: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between healing rate, avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head and two reductions-open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction internal fixation (CRIF) for femoral neck fracture.A literature-based search was conducted to identify all relevant studies published before September 10, 2013. The odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for estimating the effects of the two reduction methods. Data were independently extracted by two investigators who reached a consensus on all of the items. The heterogeneity between studies was examined by ?2-based Q statistic. Egger's regression analysis was used to evaluate publication bias. Statistical analysis was performed by Stata 10.0 software.We examined 14 publications. The results of the present meta-analysis showed that AVN of femoral head were significant associated with the two reductions (CRIF vs. ORIF, OR=1.746, 95% CI 1.159-2.628, p=0.008), while the healing rate were not (CRIF vs. ORIF, OR=0.853, 95% CI 0.573-1.270, p=0.433).The present meta-analysis indicated the risk of AVN of femoral head was significant higher after CRIF fixation compared with ORIF, but no association between the healing rate and the two reductions for femoral neck fracture.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885566","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.9065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.777398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.328474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.321849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.227465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Statistic","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.19775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"September 10","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_10"},{"name":"628","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/628"},{"name":"1592","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1592"},{"name":"853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/853"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Parity (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"}]}
