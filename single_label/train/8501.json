{"id":8501,"title":"Chemical stimulation of the intracranial dura activates NALP3 inflammasome in trigeminal ganglia neurons.","abstract":"Inflammasomes are molecular platforms that upon activation by cellular infection or stress trigger the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1? to engage innate immune defenses. Increased production of IL-1? in pain and inflammation such as headache is well documented. However, limited evidence addresses the participation of inflammasomes in inflammatory pain. The present study used rat inflammatory dural stimulation-induced model of intracranial pain to assess whether headache-related pain can induce the activation of NACHT, LRR, and PYD-containing protein (NALP)-3 inflammasome pathway in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and which cells express NALP3 inflammasome proteins and IL-1?. Chemical stimulation of the intracranial dura caused a total drug dose- and time-dependent induction of activated caspase-1 and mature IL-1? proteins. Application of a selective caspase-1 inhibitor diminished these effects. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both NALP3 inflammasome and IL-1? immunoreactivity were existed mainly in small to medium-sized C-type neurons and increased over time, with intense cytoplasmic staining after 3 days of dural inflammation. Overall, the present observation indicated that dural inflammation promoted assembly of the multiprotein NALP3 complex, activated caspase-1, and induced processing of IL-1?, which provides an indirect evidence of the participation of NALP3 inflammasome in the cascade of events involved in the genesis of headaches by promoting IL-1? maturation in the TG. This may contribute to strategies for headache control.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Animal
