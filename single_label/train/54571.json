{"id":54571,"title":"The effects of lowering nighttime and breakfast glucose levels with sensor-augmented pump therapy on hemoglobin A1c levels in type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"This study determined the association of continuous glucose monitoring glucose (CGM-glucose) levels at different times of the day with improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The potential application of these data is to focus effort to improve glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes.Data were analyzed from 196 patients with type 1 diabetes who were randomized to receive sensor-augmented pump therapy in the 1-year STAR 3 trial. CGM-glucose values and HbA1c levels from baseline and after 1 year were evaluated to determine associations of improvement in CGM-glucose at different times of the day with longitudinal improvement in HbA1c.Improvement in HbA1c levels after 1 year was related to improvement in mean CGM-glucose levels in daytime (6 a.m.-midnight), overnight (midnight-6 a.m.), and each mealtime period (P<0.0001 for each). In multivariable analysis, only improvement in breakfast meal period was associated with improvement in HbA1c after 1 year, explaining 59% of the HbA1c improvement using the partial R(2) test. Moreover, among those patients who only improved CGM-glucose in the overnight period there was an associated improvement in breakfast meal period CGM-glucose of 26 Â± 22 mg/dL (P<0.01).Breakfast period glucose improvement had the greatest effect on lowering HbA1c levels in patients with type 1 diabetes. Improving glucose control overnight resulted in subsequent improvement in the breakfast period. Although glucose control should be improved at all times, methods to improve overnight and post-breakfast glucose levels may be of primary importance in improving glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450776","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.83303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.650234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.633295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.25402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.151152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"Midnight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Breakfast","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
