{"id":23628,"title":"Comparison of two assays for molecular determination of rifampin resistance in clinical samples from patients with Buruli ulcer disease.","abstract":"This study evaluates a novel assay for detecting rifampin resistance in clinical Mycobacterium ulcerans isolates. Although highly susceptible for PCR inhibitors in 50% of the samples tested, the assay was 100% M. ulcerans specific and yielded >98% analyzable sequences with a lower limit of detection of 100 to 200 copies of the target sequence.
