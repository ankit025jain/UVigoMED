{"id":72116,"title":"Unusual case of recurrent thigh lump in a girl: a case report.","abstract":"Lipofibromatosis is a rare fibro-fatty tumour with a predilection to involve distal extremities. It has only recently been described as a distinctive clinicopathologic entity, and subsequently only a few cases have been published in the literature. To address the clinicopathologic significance of this rare entity, we here describe a case of lipofibromatosis occurring on the left thigh of a Sri Lankan girl who developed a recurrence following excision.A 15-year-old previously healthy girl of Sri Lankan ethnicity presented with a painless progressively enlarging mass in her left thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging of her thigh lump, revealed a septated mass arising from subcutaneous tissue of anterolateral and medial aspects of her thigh. Histological assessment revealed evidence of lipofibromatosis, and the lesion was excised followed by split-skin grafting. She presented again with a local recurrence at the same site.Adequate surgical excision leads to complete cure of this benign lesion, but recurrences are common following incomplete excision. Therefore awareness among clinicians of this rare entity is vital in offering the best possible care to the patients.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998416","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.754072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.555561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.507387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.505819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.280998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Sri Lanka","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0408852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.0367544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
