{"id":47473,"title":"Role of CXCR3/CXCL10 axis in immune cell recruitment into the small intestine in celiac disease.","abstract":"Lymphocytic infiltration in the lamina propria (LP), which is primarily composed of CD4(+) Th1 cells and plasma cells, and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), is a characteristic finding in active celiac disease (CD). Signals for this selective cell recruitment have not been fully established. CXCR3 and its ligands, particularly CXCL10, have been suggested to be one of the most relevant pathways in the attraction of cells into inflamed tissues. In addition, CXCR3 is characteristically expressed by Th1 cells. The aim of this work was to investigate the participation of the chemokine CXCL10/CXCR3 axis in CD pathogenesis. A higher concentration of CXCL10 was found in the serum of untreated CD patients. The mRNA levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 but not CXCL9 were significantly higher in duodenal biopsies from untreated CD patients compared with non-CD controls or treated patients. The results demonstrate that CXCL10 is abundantly produced in untreated CD and reduced in treated patients, and the expression of CXCL10 was found to be correlated with the IFN? levels in the tissue. Plasma cells and enterocytes were identified as CXCL10-producing cells. Moreover, the CXCL10 expression in intestinal tissues was upregulated by poly I:C and IL-15. IELs, LP T lymphocytes, and plasma cells, which infiltrate the intestinal mucosa in untreated CD, express CXCR3. The CXCR3/CXCL10 signalling axis is overactivated in the small intestinal mucosa in untreated patients, and this finding explains the specific recruitment of the major cell populations that infiltrate the epithelium and the LP in CD.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586509","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.754566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.742078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Enterocyte","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocyte"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.700638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.69807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.677484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.648484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.423625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Interleukin 15","weight":0.379467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_15"},{"name":"Intestinal mucosa","weight":0.334347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_mucosa"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"CXC chemokine receptors","weight":0.10897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Lymphocytic colitis","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytic_colitis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"}]}
