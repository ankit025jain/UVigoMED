{"id":52073,"title":"Primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension: assessment of cardiovascular risk at diagnosis and after treatment.","abstract":"Primary aldosteronism (PA), the most frequent form of secondary hypertension, is characterized by a higher rate of cardiovascular (CV) events than essential hypertension (EH). Aim of the study was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk according to the ESH/ESC 2007 guidelines, in patients with PA and with EH, at diagnosis and after treatment.We prospectively studied 102 PA patients (40 with aldosterone producing adenoma-APA and 62 with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism-IHA) and 132 essential hypertensives at basal and after surgical or medical treatment (mean follow-up period 44 months for PA and 42 months for EH). At baseline evaluation the stratification of CV risk was significantly different: the predominant risk category was the high CV risk (50% in total PA, 53% in PA matched for blood pressure values and 55% in EH), but the very high risk category was twice in PA than in EH patients (36% in total PA and 33% in matched PA vs. 17% in EH, p < 0.05). The worse risk profile of PA was due to a higher prevalence of glycemic alterations, metabolic syndrome and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p < 0.05). After adequate treatment, the CV risk was significantly reduced becoming comparable in PA and in EH patient due to a reduction of hypertension grading, prevalence of metabolic syndrome, hypertension persistence and LVH (p < 0.05).Patients with PA present a high CV risk, which is in part reversible after specific treatment, due both to the reduced blood pressure values and to the improvement of end-organ damage.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630976","annotations":[{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.671449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.607706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.494927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.478737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.170769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Primary aldosteronism","weight":0.141784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_aldosteronism"},{"name":"Secondary hypertension","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_hypertension"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hyperaldosteronism","weight":0.0940385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaldosteronism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
