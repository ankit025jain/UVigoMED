{"id":71674,"title":"An exploration of the existential experiences of patients following curative treatment for cancer: reflections from a U.K. Sample.","abstract":"The existential experiences associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment are well researched, but the posttreatment phase is relatively underexplored. Using semistructured interviews and theory-led thematic analysis this qualitative study investigated the existential experiences of eight cancer survivors who had successfully completed curative treatment. Being in remission had led to deep existential reflections (i.e., death anxiety, freedom, isolation, and meaning making), and some participants faced considerable challenges that affected their emotional well-being. Understanding cancer survivors' existential challenges should enable health care professionals to engage with the emerging shift from the predominantly medically focused posttreatment care to a more holistic approach.
