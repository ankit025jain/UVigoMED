{"id":60570,"title":"Asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine are associated with coronary artery lesions in Kawasaki disease.","abstract":"To determine whether 3 biomarkers, L-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), can predict outcomes in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD).Plasma levels of L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA were measured in 39 patients with KD and 27 febrile control patients.Plasma L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA levels were lower in patients with KD than in control patients before treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; P=.027, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). After treatment with IVIG, L-arginine, ADMA, L-arginine/ADMA ratios, and arginine methylation ([ADMA+SDMA]/L-arginine) increased significantly (P<.001, P=.001, P=.014, and P=.001, respectively). Compared with control patients, persistent lower SDMA and higher ADMA/SDMA ratios existed in patients with KD. Furthermore, a lesser magnitude of change in terms of L-arginine and ADMA/SDMA ratios after IVIG treatment was associated with the formation of coronary dilation (P=.025, and .029, respectively).Levels of L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA appear to be associated with KD. Lower L-arginine levels and ADMA/SDMA after treatment with IVIG was associated with coronary artery abnormalities patients with KD.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874168","annotations":[{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.807151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.725634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.717974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.677896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.596043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.587257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.563785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.480419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Space-division multiple access","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-division_multiple_access"},{"name":"Coronary artery anomaly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_anomaly"},{"name":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dimethylarginine"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Asymmetric synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_synthesis"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
