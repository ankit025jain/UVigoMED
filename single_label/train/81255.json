{"id":81255,"title":"[Prevalence of dental caries among 12-year old schoolchildren in the Dakar region].","abstract":"Oral diseases are considered as major public health problem. Dental caries restricts the school activities and are the dominant cause of dental morbidity. The aims of this survey were to determine prevalence of dental caries among pupils of Dakar and to study their food habits and oral hygiene. A descriptive transversal study was conducted from February 15th to May 07th, 2011 with respect of WHO directives (protocol of 1997) readjusted to Senegalese context. Our results showed a prevalence of 41.8%; a mean DMF index of 0.644; a proportion of teeth decayed of 65%, 32.2% for missing teeth and 2.7% of filled teeth. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that snacking, consumption of sweetened drinks far from meals and brushing teeth before the meals were significantly linked to the presence of dental caries. These results showed that the state of oral health and the prevention level of dental caries among these children were not so good. A new orientation of oral health policy based on messages regarding the main etiologic factors is imperative.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223148","annotations":[{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.936804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Health policy","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.570133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.553642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.463391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"School","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.136059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Ethology","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Dakar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Sugar substitute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_substitute"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Snack food","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack_food"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"}]}
