{"id":84699,"title":"Superolateral hoffa fat-pad edema and patellofemoral maltracking: predictive modeling.","abstract":"Superolateral Hoffa fat-pad edema is a frequent finding with patellar maltracking and may precede clinically significant chondrosis. The purpose of this study was to clarify which patellofemoral measurements are most highly associated and to develop a prediction rule to guide clinical decision making.Twenty-three patellofemoral measurements were performed on 71 knees retrospectively identified as having superolateral Hoffa fat-pad edema at MRI (Hoffa group) and on 45 normal knees (normal group). Univariate analysis was performed to examine the association between these measurements and Hoffa fat-pad edema. Classification and regression tree analysis with 10-fold cross validation was used to generate a prediction model.For 16 of the 23 patellofemoral measurements, there was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the Hoffa and normal groups. Classification and regression tree analysis identified a prediction model in which a patient is placed into the Hoffa group if one of three conditions is met: lateral patellar displacement greater than -3.6 mm and Insall-Salvati ratio greater than 0.99; lateral patellar displacement of -3.6 mm or less and Insall-Salvati ratio greater than 1.23; or lateral patellar displacement of -3.6 mm or less, Insall-Salvati ratio of 1.23 or less, and lateral trochlear inclination of 16.5Â° or less. In fitting of the original sample, this model had 91.6% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for identifying the Hoffa group. When 10-fold cross validation was applied, the estimated generalizable sensitivity and specificity were 85.9% and 75.6%.Superolateral Hoffa fat-pad is strongly associated with a number of measures of patellar maltracking. A prediction model based on these measurements is accurate for differentiating knees with superolateral Hoffa fat-pad edema from normal knees.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055295","annotations":[{"name":"Decision tree learning","weight":0.916285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning"},{"name":"Predictive modelling","weight":0.829254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modelling"},{"name":"Cross-validation (statistics)","weight":0.814378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.795781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.558588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.29279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.159287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Trochlear nerve","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Hoffa","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffa"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Generalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
