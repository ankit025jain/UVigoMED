{"id":8339,"title":"Cardioprotective effects of thyroid hormones in a rat model of myocardial infarction are associated with oxidative stress reduction.","abstract":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved with progression from infarction to heart failure. Studies show that thyroid hormones (TH) present cardioprotective effects. This study aims to evaluate whether TH effects after infarction are associated to redox balance modulation. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Sham-operated (SHAM), infarcted (AMI), sham-operated+TH (SHAMT), and infarcted+TH (AMIT). During 26 days, animals received T3 (2 ?g/100g/day) and T4 (8 ?g/100g/day) by gavage. Echocardiographic parameters were assessed and heart tissue was collected to biochemical analysis. AMIT rats presented absence of lung congestion, less cardiac dilatation, and normalization in myocardial performance index, compared with AMI. AMI rats presented an increase in hydrogen peroxide levels and in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in GSH/GSSG. TH prevented these alterations in AMIT. In conclusion, TH seem to reduce the levels of ROS, preventing oxidative stress, and improving cardiac function in infarcted rats.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784706","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.93323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.855549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Thyroid hormone","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.463153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.436774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.415464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.368758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.242835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.190185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Stress management","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Tyrosine hydroxylase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
