{"id":65815,"title":"Enteric hyperoxaluria secondary to small bowel resection: use of computer simulation to characterize urinary risk factors for stone formation and assess potential treatment protocols.","abstract":"We used computer modeling to investigate the influence of physicochemical stone risk factors on urinary supersaturation (SS) of calcium oxalate (CaOx) in patients with severe hyperoxaluria, relative hypocalciuria, hypocitraturia, and CaOx nephrolithiasis after extensive small bowel resection, usually performed for Crohn's disease. We also simulated different treatment strategies, including oral calcium supplements and citrate, in such patients.A baseline urine model was derived by consolidating data acquired by ourselves with those from another patient cohort. Calcium and oxalate excretions in this model were altered to obtain an extreme case. For comparison, additional models were based on published urine data from normal subjects (N) and idiopathic CaOx stone formers (SF). The Joint Expert Speciation System was used to simulate different urine situations based on reported compositional values.[Ca(2+)][Ox(2-)] ionic concentration products and SS(CaOx) are substantially higher in enteric hyperoxaluric patients than in N and SF, despite their relatively lower calcium excretions. Molar Ca:Ox ratios are substantially lower in enteric hyperoxalurics than in N and SF. Oral calcium supplements can reduce SS(CaOx), but monitoring is required to avoid exceeding a safe dosing threshold. A simple calculation can alert the clinician that this threshold is being approached or even exceeded. Increasing urinary pH and citrate decreases SS(CaOx) but not to the same extent as decreasing Ox excretion.Calcium supplements can help reduce stone risk in patients with severe enteric hyperoxaluria, but initial efforts should be directed toward reducing urinary oxalate by reducing dietary oxalate. Citrate therapy that increases both urine pH and urinary citrate provides an additional therapeutic benefit.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Male Urogenital
