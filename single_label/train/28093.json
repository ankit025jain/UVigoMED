{"id":28093,"title":"[The analysis of the bipolarity features in students of arts and the students of technology].","abstract":"The aim of the research was to assess the prevalence of the bipolar spectrum features among students of a variety of faculties, by dividing them arbitrarily into 'art' or 'technology' cohorts.120 subjects were examined, including 57 students of arts, and 63 students of technology. The tools used included a basic socio-demographic questionnaire and the Hirschfeld Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ).The bipolar spectrum features (as identified by the MDQ responses) were significantly more prevalent among the students of arts, as compared to the students of technology (28.2% vs. 4.8%, p < or = 0.001; OR = 7.8; CI 95%: 2.13-28.51; p < 0.01). Moreover, in comparison to the students of technology, the students of arts were more likely to: 1) report mood patterns of intermittent 'highs' and 'lows' (49.1% vs. 15.9%, p < or = 0.0001; OR = 5.11; CI 95%: 2.18-11.99; p < or = 0.001); 2) seek for psychiatric or psychological support (12.3% vs. 1.5%; p < or = 0.05; OR = 5.2; CI 95%: 1.79-15.21; p < or = 0.01); 3) have a history of utilisation of psychotropic medications (31% vs. 7.9%, p < or = 0.001; OR = 8.7; CI 95%: 1.03-72.9; p < or = 0.05). They were also more likely to use psychoactive substances (other than alcohol).The considerable prevalence of the bipolarity features (as measured by the MDQ), combined with higher prevalence of intermittent periods of elevated or depressed mood, higher likelihood of seeking for psychiatric or psychological treatment, and higher prevalence of using psychoactive medications/substances in the cohort of the students of arts indicate a significant association between artistic talents and creativity, and the bipolar spectrum disorders.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011227","annotations":[{"name":"Creativity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.789416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mood disorder","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.679966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.235298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"The arts","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Bipolar spectrum","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_spectrum"},{"name":"Psychiatric rehabilitation","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Freedom of association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"}]}
