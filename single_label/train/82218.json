{"id":82218,"title":"Radiographic evaluation of crestal bone levels of delayed implants at medium-term follow-up.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the radiographic bone level changes after delayed implant placement at medium-term follow-up, with three elements kept constant: keratinized gingiva thickness, implant axes perpendicular to the opposing occlusal surface, and implants with a collar of 2 mm.Patients treated in a private practice setting were retrospectively enrolled in the study. They underwent delayed placement (4 to 8 weeks after extraction) of dental implants in edentulous premolar or molar regions. Implants followed a delayed loading protocol. Crestal bone levels were measured at baseline; at provisional prosthesis placement; at 1, 3, and 5 years; and at medium-term follow-up of healing from implant placement.One hundred twenty patients received 135 implants (one or two implants per patient); 3 implants were lost. After a mean follow-up period of 9.71 ± 4.88 years, a survival rate of 97.76% was reported. At 1 year after implant placement, mean bone loss of -1.5 ± 0.62 mm was found. At almost 3 years post-implant placement, a mean bone gain of +1.20 ± 0.49 mm was seen, which was statistically significantly different compared with 1 year. After this point, the bone levels remained stable; similar values were reported over time, with no significant differences.The mean vertical bone gain of +1.20 ± 0.49 mm seen at almost 3 years after implant placement in this study may be supported by both clinical parameters as presence of sufficiently thick keratinized gingiva (3 mm), implants with a 2-mm collar, and the axis of implant insertion perpendicular to the opposing occlusal surface.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683572","annotations":[{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.717944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.672698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.622812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.392977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.373382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.337968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.141379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.113403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.082094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Perpendicular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"Collar (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(clothing)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Practice of law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law"},{"name":"2005 World Series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_World_Series"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
