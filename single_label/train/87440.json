{"id":87440,"title":"[Analysis of clinical effects of percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous kyphoplasty in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture].","abstract":"To explore the clinical outcomes of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).From January 2007 to February 2010, the data of 40 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture underwent treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Of them,20 patients were treated with PVP (PVP group), there were 8 males and 12 females with an average age of (66.37 +/- 2.34) years old (54 to 81); 20 patients were treated with PKP (PKP group), there were 11 males and 9 females with an average of (65.12 +/- 3.21) years old (56 to 79). Postoperative at 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year, pain and daily life function were respectively assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and Barthel index (BI); and anterior height of responsibility vertebra, Cobb angle were measured by X-rays.In PVP group, 1 case complicated with bone cement leakage without clinical symptoms and no operation to treat. No postoperative infection and deep vein thrombosis were found between two groups. All patients were followed up more than 1 year, pain and daily life function has obviously improved than preoperative (P < 0.01); and there was no significant difference on 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year after operation (P > 0.05); there was no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). In PVP group, there was no significant difference in anterior height of responsibility vertebra, Cobb angle before and after operation;and in PKP group, postoperative data has obviously improved than preoperative (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference postoperative at 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year (P > 0.05); there was no significant difference between two groups at 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year after operation.Both the methods can obviously relieve pain and completely or partly recover daily life function in treating OVCF. But PKP has advantages of recovery of anterior height of responsibility vertebra and correction of Cobb angle, especially for serious compression.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167667","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.815286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.767865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.620292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.445291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.327918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.26113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.16181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Cobb angle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_angle"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Player versus player","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Thomas Barthel","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Barthel"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Business intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Polish State Railways","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_State_Railways"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"}]}
