{"id":77292,"title":"Associations between worker characteristics, workplace factors, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders: a cross-sectional study of male construction workers in Nigeria.","abstract":"This study assessed the association between worker characteristics, workplace factors, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in Nigeria's construction industry.A cross-sectional site-by-site survey was conducted in 5 existing construction companies in Uyo, Nigeria. The subjects (n = 1200 males), aged 18-55 years, filled in the semistructured Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire and the job content questionnaire on demographics, work and lifestyle characteristics, and workplace risk factors for WMSDs.The overall prevalence of WMSDs was 39.25%. Differences in age, race, weight, body mass index (BMI), education status, and employment status were significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. Prevalence according to trade was as follows: ironworkers highest at 49% and administrative staff lowest at 31%. Ironworkers (55.7%), administrative staff (53.3%), and security staff (38.7%) scored higher on physical, psychosocial, and individual risk factors, respectively. Workplace factors with increased odds for WMSDs were psychological demands and mental workload, age, BMI, low work experience, low education status, awkward movement of head and arms, working against force or vibration, fast work pace, and race.The recorded high prevalence was multifactorial in etiology; hence, multi-intervention strategies are required.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189749","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.833774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.597515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.472136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.338707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.321729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.251631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.129443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Trade","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Vibration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Work experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_experience"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Nordic countries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
