{"id":91630,"title":"Treating acute Essex-Lopresti injury with the TightRope device: a case study.","abstract":"Essex-Lopresti injury consists of a fracture or dislocation of the radial head, rupture of the interosseous membrane (IOM), which is the main pathology, and a dislocated distal radio-ulnar joint. There are several reports in the literature, including cadaveric studies, which suggest an operative solution for this complicated injury. The torn IOM is not treated during the traditional operative repair. In the following paper, we suggest a treatment for the IOM by unloading it with the TightRope device. This device temporarily takes the tension off the torn IOM and assists in reduction and maintenance of the longitudinal ratios between the radius and the ulna, while allowing its healing. Recently, we have treated one patient with this system. The application of the TightRope technique in this acute injury and the follow-up are described in this case report.
