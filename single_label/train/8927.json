{"id":8927,"title":"Motor criteria evaluation of iso-anisoperistaltic graft in oesophageal reconstruction -- an experimental study of isolated colic graft motility pattern in dogs.","abstract":"In the medical literature there are more than one opinion in favour of the isoperistaltic interposed loop, considering it to render a higher propulsive activity and thus with much better functionality, with less intense symptoms of regurgitation,reflux or aspiration. Technically, however, due to anatomical relationships, anisoperistaltic graft interposition is more convenient. Is this detrimental to functionality? What is the best peristaltic model? At first sight, it seems that due to the local anatomy and surgical technique involved, we compromise at the expense of better functionality. To find the answer to these questions, starting from the typical pattern of colonic motility in the transverse and left colon, we need to identify new motor behaviour of the isolated colic segment. Because motor activity is generated by electric waves discharged from the area control centre, their electromyographic registration would allow finding the contractile pattern of a transplanted loop.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742413","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Peristalsis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.531755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Horse colic","weight":0.467716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_colic"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.222892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.118447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Area Control Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_Control_Center"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Interposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interposition"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Prokinetic agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokinetic_agent"}]}
