{"id":68083,"title":"[Stage IV prostate cancer in Guadeloupe, a French Caribbean archipelago].","abstract":"To study clinical characteristics, in terms of survival and response to treatment, of patients with non-localized prostate cancer at diagnosis in an Afro-Caribbean population from Guadeloupe.Cases of stage IV prostate cancer (T4N0M0, TxN1M0 and TxNxM1) at diagnosis in the Pointe Ã  Pitre Hospital were selected from 1995 to 2012 and studied.One hundred and eighty-three patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 70.3 years old (79.2% were more than 65 years). A total of 81.5% of them was TxNxM1 and 11.5% was TxN1M0. Median disease free survival was 18.5 months. Median overall survival was 49.0 months.This study about non-localized prostate cancer at diagnosis in an Afro-Caribbean population from a French Caribbean archipelago seemed to show no difference with general population suffering from the same disease, although prostate cancer incidence in this area is one of the highest in the world.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560205","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.710201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Caribbean","weight":0.553577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean"},{"name":"France","weight":0.426797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.369512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Archipelago","weight":0.364456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.331976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.27107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Guadeloupe","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"List of grape diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_diseases"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Ironman 70.3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3"},{"name":"Astra 1M","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_1M"},{"name":"French Caribbean","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Caribbean"},{"name":"M0 motorway (Hungary)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M0_motorway_(Hungary)"}]}
