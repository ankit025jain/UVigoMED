{"id":66934,"title":"Intrafraction prostate translations and rotations during hypofractionated robotic radiation surgery: dosimetric impact of correction strategies and margins.","abstract":"To investigate the dosimetric impact of intrafraction prostate motion and the effect of robot correction strategies for hypofractionated CyberKnife treatments with a simultaneously integrated boost.A total of 548 real-time prostate motion tracks from 17 patients were available for dosimetric simulations of CyberKnife treatments, in which various correction strategies were included. Fixed time intervals between imaging/correction (15, 60, 180, and 360 seconds) were simulated, as well as adaptive timing (ie, the time interval reduced from 60 to 15 seconds in case prostate motion exceeded 3 mm or 2° in consecutive images). The simulated extent of robot corrections was also varied: no corrections, translational corrections only, and translational corrections combined with rotational corrections up to 5°, 10°, and perfect rotational correction. The correction strategies were evaluated for treatment plans with a 0-mm or 3-mm margin around the clinical target volume (CTV). We recorded CTV coverage (V100%) and dose-volume parameters of the peripheral zone (boost), rectum, bladder, and urethra.Planned dose parameters were increasingly preserved with larger extents of robot corrections. A time interval between corrections of 60 to 180 seconds provided optimal preservation of CTV coverage. To achieve 98% CTV coverage in 98% of the treatments, translational and rotational corrections up to 10° were required for the 0-mm margin plans, whereas translational and rotational corrections up to 5° were required for the 3-mm margin plans. Rectum and bladder were spared considerably better in the 0-mm margin plans. Adaptive timing did not improve delivered dose.Intrafraction prostate motion substantially affected the delivered dose but was compensated for effectively by robot corrections using a time interval of 60 to 180 seconds. A 0-mm margin required larger extents of additional rotational corrections than a 3-mm margin but resulted in lower doses to rectum and bladder.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661668","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.370527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.200212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.148197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.132302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"CTV Television Network","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Cyberknife","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberknife"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"548","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/548"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Euclidean group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group"},{"name":"Extent (file systems)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extent_(file_systems)"},{"name":"Perfection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Xbox 360","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Corrections","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"}]}
