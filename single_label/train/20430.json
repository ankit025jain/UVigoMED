{"id":20430,"title":"Serratia marcescens harbouring SME-type class A carbapenemases in Canada and the presence of blaSME on a novel genomic island, SmarGI1-1.","abstract":"An increasing prevalence since 2010 of Serratia marcescens harbouring the Ambler class A carbapenemase SME prompted us to further characterize these isolates.Isolates harbouring bla(SME) were identified by PCR and sequencing. Phenotypic analysis for carbapenemase activity was carried out by a modified Hodge test and a modified Carba NP test. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by Etest and Vitek 2. Typing was by PFGE of macrorestriction digests. Whole-genome sequencing of three isolates was carried out to characterize the genomic region harbouring the bla(SME)-type genes.All S. marcescens harbouring SME-type enzymes could be detected using a modified Carba NP test. Isolates harbouring bla(SME) were resistant to penicillins and carbapenems, but remained susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, as well as fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Isolates exhibited diverse genetic backgrounds, though 57% of isolates were found in three clusters. Analysis of whole-genome sequence data from three isolates revealed that the bla(SME) gene occurred in a novel cryptic prophage genomic island, SmarGI1-1.There has been an increasing occurrence of S. marcescens harbouring bla(SME) in Canada since 2010. The bla(SME) gene was found on a genomic island, SmarGI1-1, that can be excised and circularized, which probably contributes to its dissemination amongst S. marcescens.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659751","annotations":[{"name":"Prophage","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophage"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.620533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.608968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.498826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Serratia marcescens","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratia_marcescens"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.163972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Genomic island","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_island"},{"name":"Serratia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratia"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Small and medium enterprises","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium_enterprises"},{"name":"NP (complexity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Ambler, Pennsylvania","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambler,_Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Crypsis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypsis"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"}]}
