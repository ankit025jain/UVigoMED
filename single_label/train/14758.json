{"id":14758,"title":"Thiazolopyridone ureas as DNA gyrase B inhibitors: optimization of antitubercular activity and efficacy.","abstract":"Scaffold hopping from the thiazolopyridine ureas led to thiazolopyridone ureas with potent antitubercular activity acting through inhibition of DNA GyrB ATPase activity. Structural diversity was introduced, by extension of substituents from the thiazolopyridone N-4 position, to access hydrophobic interactions in the ribose pocket of the ATP binding region of GyrB. Further optimization of hydrogen bond interactions with arginines in site-2 of GyrB active site pocket led to potent inhibition of the enzyme (IC50 2 nM) along with potent cellular activity (MIC=0.1 ?M) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Efficacy was demonstrated in an acute mouse model of tuberculosis on oral administration.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405701","annotations":[{"name":"Hydrogen bond","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.848983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.809329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Ribose","weight":0.794664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.74964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Active site","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_site"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"DNA gyrase","weight":0.632693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_gyrase"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.554409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Substituent","weight":0.485768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent"},{"name":"ATPase","weight":0.421364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATPase"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.400529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.295549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.01593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
