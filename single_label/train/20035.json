{"id":20035,"title":"Molecular identification, genotyping, and antifungal susceptibility testing of clinically relevant Trichosporon species from Argentina.","abstract":"Trichosporon species are emerging causative agents of mycoses; most are documented in immunocompromised patients. Species identification is important for epidemiological purposes in order to better define species clinical associations and to improve antifungal treatment. Here, we studied a collection of 41 Trichosporon strains recovered from hospitalized patients in Argentina. All strains were identified by sequencing the D1/D2 domain of 26S, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, and intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) region. In addition, we determined the IGS1 region genotypes of the suspected T. asahii strains. Antifungal susceptibility of all strains was investigated. Thirty-eight of the 41 strains in this study were identified as follows: 29 T. asahii, 3 T. inkin, 3 T. montevideense, 2 T. faecale, and 1 T. dermatis. The identity of the three remaining strains could not be confirmed. Strain DMic 114126 (Culture collection of the Mycology Department (DMic), National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Dr. Carlos G. Malbr√°n\".) may represent a T. asahii subspecies or a new Trichosporon species, strain DMic 94750 was identified as T. cf. guehoae and strain DMic 114132 as T. cf. akiyoshidainum. The distribution of T. asahii genotypes was as follows: 12 genotype 3, 9 genotype 1, 4 genotype 4, 2 genotype 5, and 2 genotype 7. Amphotericin B minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were ?1 mg/l for 78% (32/41) of the strains. Fluconazole MICs were ?2 mg/l for 90% of the strains. However, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole MICs were ?1 mg/l for 100% of the strains. Terbinafine MICs were ?1 mg/l for 98% 40/41 of the strains.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682113","annotations":[{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.939184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Ketoconazole","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.807638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.741952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Posaconazole","weight":0.715959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posaconazole"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.574558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Terbinafine","weight":0.521772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terbinafine"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.455339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.393778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Mycology","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Subspecies","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"},{"name":"Trichosporon","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichosporon"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Internal transcribed spacer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_transcribed_spacer"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Domain (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
