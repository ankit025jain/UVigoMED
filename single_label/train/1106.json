{"id":1106,"title":"Provocative issues in heart disease prevention.","abstract":"In this article, new areas of cardiovascular (CV) prevention and rehabilitation research are discussed: high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and new concepts in nutrition. HIIT consists of brief periods of high-intensity exercise interspersed by periods of low-intensity exercise or rest. The optimal mode according our work (15-second exercise intervals at peak power with passive recovery intervals of the same duration) is associated with longer total exercise time, similar time spent near peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) VO2 peak, and lesser perceived exertion relative to other protocols that use longer intervals and active recovery periods. Evidence also suggests that compared with moderate-intensity continuous exercise training, HIIT has superior effects on cardiorespiratory function and on the attenuation of multiple cardiac and peripheral abnormalities. With respect to nutrition, a growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is influenced by lifestyle choices and might play a pivotal role in modulating CV disease development. For example, recent evidence linking processed (but not unprocessed) meats to increased CV risk pointed to the gut microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide as a potential culprit. In addition, altered gut microbiota could also mediate the proinflammatory and cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with excess added free sugar consumption, and in particular high-fructose corn syrup. Substantially more research is required, however, to fully understand how and which alterations in gut flora can prevent or lead to CV disease and other chronic illnesses. We conclude with thoughts about the appropriate role for HIIT in CV training and future research in the role of gut flora-directed interventions in CV prevention.
