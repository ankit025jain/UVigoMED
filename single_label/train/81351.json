{"id":81351,"title":"One-year clinical evaluation of a Glass Carbomer fissure sealant, a preliminary study.","abstract":"Glass Carbomer is a new generation of restorative material developed from glass-ionomer cements with possibility of gradual mineralization into fluorapatite. The aim of this clinical trial was to investigate the retention of Glass Carbomer fissure sealant after 12 months, in comparison to a commonly used conventional resin-based sealant. Forty-eight teeth in 24 patients [mean (SD) = 8 (2.3) years] with well-delineated fissure morphology were randomly divided into two equal groups and sealed with Bis-GMA resin-based Helioseal F (group A, Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein) and Glass Carbomer (group B, Glass Carbomer Sealant, Glass Carbomer Products, Leiden, Netherlands) using the split mouth design. Materials were placed and set according to the manufacturer's instructions using a polymerization unit Bluephase 16i (Vivadent, Liechtenstein). Complete sealant retentions in both groups were 100% and 75% after 6 and 12 months of clinical service, respectively. There were there were no secondary caries lesions in both groups after 6 months; two new carious lesions were detected in both groups after 12 months. The Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant difference between the two groups at both evaluations points (P > 0.05). Glass Carbomer material showed a similar retention rate when compared with a resin-based sealant. Future studies are required to examine the long-term performance of Glass Carbomer sealants.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134364","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Polymerization","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization"},{"name":"Liechtenstein","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.330597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.293831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Material","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material"},{"name":"Dental restorative materials","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restorative_materials"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Carbomer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbomer"},{"name":"Leiden","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden"},{"name":"Sealant","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealant"},{"name":"Fluorapatite","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorapatite"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Seal (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Retention rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_rate"},{"name":"Dental sealant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_sealant"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Dental cement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_cement"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
