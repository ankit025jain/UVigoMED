{"id":53085,"title":"Efficacy and safety of add on therapy of bromocriptine with metformin in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized open labeled phase IV clinical trial.","abstract":"To compare the effectiveness and safety of add on therapy of bromocriptine with metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.Adult type 2 DM patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized in three groups. Group A received metformin (1000 mg/ day), while group B patients were treated with metformin (1000 mg/day) plus bromocriptine (0.8 mg/day) and group C received metformin (1000 mg/day) plus bromocriptine (1.6 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPPG), and body weight were measured at week 4, 8, and 12 visits and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1C)) at week 12 visit.Metformin alone and in combination with bromocriptine in escalating dose (0.8 mg/day and 1.6 mg/day) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased FPG and PPPG levels at weeks 4, 8, and 12 compared with pretreatment values. HbA(1C) level in all three treatment groups significantly (P < 0.05) decreased at week 12 as compared with pretreatment baseline value. HbA1C level in groups B and C significantly (P < 0.05) decreased as compared with group A at week 12. Addition of bromocriptine to metformin also significantly (P < 0.05) decreased FPG and PPPG levels in a dose-dependent manner as compared with metformin alone. Intergroup analysis did not show any statistically significant change in weight of study subjects at different intervals.The combination of bromocriptine with metformin significantly decreased FPG, PPPG, and HbA1C compared with metformin alone in type 2 DM patients in a dose-dependent manner.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550580","annotations":[{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.834955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.554997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Bromocriptine","weight":0.453889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromocriptine"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.381855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.329879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.320694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.287057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.252555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
