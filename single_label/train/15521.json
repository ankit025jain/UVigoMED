{"id":15521,"title":"The role of surgical debridement in different clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis.","abstract":"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and is associated with high mortality rates. Early initiation of systemic antimould therapy remains the most important measure to reduce mortality. Surgical debridement is an important additional therapeutic option mainly in cases of extrapulmonary IA. The main intention for surgical intervention in IA is to obtain material for diagnosis and antifungal susceptibility testing. There are, however, also therapeutic implications for surgical interventions in rare manifestation of IA such as endocarditis or mycotic aneurysm. Here, we will review the role of surgical interventions in the treatment of different clinical manifestations of IA.
