{"id":90620,"title":"Percutaneous pulmonary vein stenosis angioplasty complicated by rupture: successful stenting with a polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent.","abstract":"A 47-year-old-man with prior pulmonary vein (PV) isolation for atrial fibrillation developed progressive shortness of breath and was found to have total occlusion of the left lower and significant stenosis in left upper PV. A ventilation/perfusion scan showed decreased left lung perfusion. Percutaneous PV stenosis angioplasty was complicated by the rupture of left lower PV with pericardial tamponade; successful stenting with a polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent was performed. Follow-up studies at nine months showed patency of both veins with a normal ventilation perfusion scan. In this article, we will discuss acquired PV stenosis following PV isolation, percutaneous PV intervention, and the literature supporting the procedure.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590687","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary vein","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.676651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.401131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.238585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Isolation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Human left lung","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_left_lung"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
