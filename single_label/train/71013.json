{"id":71013,"title":"Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms of monoclonal antibody therapy of cancer.","abstract":"Targeted therapies like treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have entered the arsenal of modern anticancer drugs. mAbs combine specificity with multiple effector functions that can lead to reduction of tumour burden. Direct mechanisms of action, including induction of apoptosis or growth inhibition, depend on the biology of the target antigen. Fc tails of mAbs have furthermore the potential to initiate complement-dependent lysis as well as immune effector cell-mediated tumour cell killing via binding to Fc receptors. Natural killer cells can induce apoptosis via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), whereas macrophages are able to phagocytose mAb-opsonized tumour cells (antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis; ADCP). Finally, neutrophils can induce non-apoptotic tumour cell death, especially in the presence of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antitumour mAbs. In spite of promising clinical successes in some malignancies, improvement of mAb immunotherapy is required to achieve overall complete remission in cancer patients. New strategies to enhance Fc receptor-mediated mechanisms of action or to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the tumour in mAb therapy of cancer are therefore currently being explored and will be addressed in this chapter.
