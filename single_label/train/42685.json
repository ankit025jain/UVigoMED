{"id":42685,"title":"Protective immunity against HEV.","abstract":"Rural community of Dongtai City in eastern China is endemic for hepatitis E virus (HEV), with the zoonotic genotype 4 virus predominating. The virus appears to be widely distributed in environment at generally low levels, such that infection is common, but >97% of which are asymptomatic and provoke a modest antibody response. Naturally acquired immunity affords 75% protection against infection, prevents disease caused by primary infection and alleviates severity of the disease caused by the residual infection that had evaded host immune surveillance. The protection, however, is extended to a minority, while leaving the majority of population essentially without the benefits of immune protection. Vaccination affords similar level of protection as does natural immunity, but expands the protective coverage to the entire population.
