{"id":6243,"title":"Crystalloid and colloid therapy.","abstract":"Fluid therapy is a cornerstone of emergency medicine, but equine practitioners should be aware of recent developments that have modified previous recommendations. First, new emphasis on the avoidance of hyperchloremia suggests that crystalloids with a lower chloride concentration may be more appropriate for use. Second, modifications to the understanding of the Starling equation suggest that the benefits of colloids may be more limited than previously thought. In addition, the negative effects of fluid overload on morbidity and mortality are becoming increasingly recognized. Although more specific research in horses is needed, these principles are likely to apply across all species.
