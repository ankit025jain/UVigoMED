{"id":68426,"title":"Efficacy of a mobile lithotripsy service: a one-year review of 222 patients.","abstract":"Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the management of choice for ureteric and renal stones 20 mm or smaller, with a stone clearance rate of up to 89%. This study determined whether such a high success rate could apply to centres using mobile ESWL, by reviewing the performance at one centre that provides such a service.Between July 2011 and July 2012, 222 patients (median age 51 years, range 18-90 years) underwent one to five sessions of ESWL for ureteric and renal stones (mean size 15 mm, range 4-22 mm). Stone clearance was regarded as residual fragments 2 mm or smaller after completion of sessions.In total, 110 out of 222 patients (49%) were clear of stones. Stones were radiopaque in 198 (89%) and radiolucent in 24 patients (11%), with clearance rates of 48% and 63%, respectively. Regarding size, 36 (16%) were 1-5 mm, 144 (65%) 5-10 mm, 28 (12%) 10-15 mm, eight (4%) 15-20 mm and six (3%) larger than 20 mm, with clearance rates of 61%, 55%, 18%, 13% and 50%, respectively. In total, 173 (78%) were renal stones and 49 (22%) ureteric, with respective clearance rates of 49% and 51%. For kidney stones, 15 (9%) were in the upper, 32 (18%) in the mid, 75 (43%) in the lower pole and 51 (30%) in the pelvis, with clearance rates of 52%, 59%, 49% and 41%; for ureteric stones, 32 (65%) were in the upper, 10 (20%) in the mid and seven (15%) in the lower ureter, with clearance rates of 47%, 70% and 43%, respectively.The performance of mobile ESWL was significantly poorer than expected, and this may be related to a lack of clinical ownership. The authors believe that such a service should be permanently placed on site.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521183","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.607184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.563317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.146844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_shock_wave_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Lithotripsy","weight":0.0540607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotripsy"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"1890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890"},{"name":"1520","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1520"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Mexican general election, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_general_election,_2012"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dipole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole"},{"name":"Clearance rate","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_rate"}]}
