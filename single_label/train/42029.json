{"id":42029,"title":"Gastritis cystica profunda recurrence after surgical resection: 2-year follow-up.","abstract":"Gastritis cystica profunda (GCP) is an uncommon disease characterized by multiple cystic gastric glands within the submucosa of the stomach.Here, we present a case of a 63-year-old man with intermittent epigastric discomfort in whom gastroscopy revealed multiple irregular elevated nodular lesions with smooth surfaces at the anterior of the antrum. Surgical resection of the nodular lesions was performed, and the diagnosis of gastritis cystica profunda (GCP) was confirmed by histological examination. Another elevated nodular lesion approximately 10 mm in diameter with an ulcer was found on the gastric side of the remnant stomach near the resection side from 6 to 24 months after the surgical resection. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and repeated biopsies of the new elevated lesion were performed. Homogeneous, anechoic masses originating from the submucosa without gastric adenocarcinoma in histological examination showed GCP recurrence may occur.We report a case of GCP recurrence within 6 months after surgical resection. GCP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of elevated lesions in the stomach.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885818","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.735611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Antrum","weight":0.627887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antrum"},{"name":"Endoscopic ultrasound","weight":0.554502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_ultrasound"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.376621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.366972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"}]}
