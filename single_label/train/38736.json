{"id":38736,"title":"Modified transseptal repair for total anomalous pulmonary venous connection repair in all age groups.","abstract":"Little data are available in late-presenting children with unobstructed totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Eleven patients underwent repair at a median age of 6.5 months using a modified transseptal approach to improve access and avoid circulatory arrest. There were no early or late deaths, and none of the patients presented pulmonary venous stenosis at a median follow-up of 8.7 years.
