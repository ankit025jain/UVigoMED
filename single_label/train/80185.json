{"id":80185,"title":"Habitat of in vivo transformation influences the levels of free radical scavengers in Clinostomum complanatum: implications for free radical scavenger based vaccines against trematode infections.","abstract":"Since free radical scavengers of parasite origin like glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase are being explored as prospective vaccine targets, availability of these molecules within the parasite infecting different hosts as well as different sites of infection is of considerable importance. Using Clinostomum complanatum, as a model helminth parasite, we analysed the effects of habitat of in vivo transformation on free radical scavengers of this trematode parasite.Using three different animal models for in vivo transformation and markedly different sites of infection, progenetic metacercaria of C. complanatum were transformed to adult ovigerous worms. Whole worm homogenates were used to estimate the levels of lipid peroxidation, a marker of oxidative stress and free radical scavengers.Site of in vivo transformation was found to drastically affect the levels of free radical scavengers in this model trematode parasite. It was observed that oxygen availability at the site of infection probably influences levels of free radical scavengers in trematode parasites.This is the first report showing that habitat of in vivo transformation affects levels of free radical scavengers in trematode parasites. Since free radical scavengers are prospective vaccine targets and parasite infection at ectopic sites is common, we propose that infections at different sites, may respond differently to free radical scavenger based vaccines.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759940","annotations":[{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.91647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Trematoda","weight":0.703668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.456676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.377647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoteny","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.204934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.174953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0647959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Trematode lifecycle stages","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematode_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Oviparity","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviparity"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
