{"id":74215,"title":"Early experience with ultrasound features after intrabeam intraoperative radiation for early stage breast cancer.","abstract":"Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is an emerging option for partial breast radiotherapy in select women with early stage breast cancer. We assessed short-term clinical and sonographic findings after breast conservation (BCT) and IORT.An IRB-approved, single institution retrospective chart review was conducted of patients (pts) treated with BCT/IORT from 1/2011 to 6/2012. Follow-up clinical breast exams and ultrasounds (US) obtained 6 and 12 months after BCT/IORT were retrospectively reviewed by a single breast radiologist (JD) for sonographic findings. P values were calculated using McNemar's test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and Chi-square.Seventy-one pts underwent BCT/IORT and 38 pts had an US. All 38 pts had a seroma, 10/38 (26%) pts were symptomatic. Eighteen pts had deep tissue closure (DTC) of the lumpectomy cavity with 5/18 (28%) DTC pts being symptomatic at follow-up versus 5/33 (15%) without DTC (P?=?0.296). At 6 months, DTC resulted in smaller seroma cavity volumes compared to those without DTC (P?=?0.03).Presence of a seroma is commonplace post BCT/IORT; symptomatic seromas are uncommon. DTC generated smaller seromas. Longer follow-up with serial US performed in all BCT/IORT pts could be considered to document natural progression/regression of symptoms and seromas.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862923","annotations":[{"name":"Lumpectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpectomy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intraoperative radiation therapy","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast self-examination","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_self-examination"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Seroma","weight":0.247041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.109783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"1038","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1038"},{"name":"Summation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Juris Doctor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Longer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longer"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
