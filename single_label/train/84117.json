{"id":84117,"title":"Knockout of histidine decarboxylase decreases bile duct ligation-induced biliary hyperplasia via downregulation of the histidine decarboxylase/VEGF axis through PKA-ERK1/2 signaling.","abstract":"Histidine is converted to histamine by histidine decarboxylase (HDC). We have shown that cholangiocytes 1) express HDC, 2) secrete histamine, and 3) proliferate after histamine treatment via ERK1/2 signaling. In bile duct-ligated (BDL) rodents, there is enhanced biliary hyperplasia, HDC expression, and histamine secretion. This studied aimed to demonstrate that knockdown of HDC inhibits biliary proliferation via downregulation of PKA/ERK1/2 signaling. HDC(-/-) mice and matching wild-type (WT) were subjected to sham or BDL. After 1 wk, serum, liver blocks, and cholangiocytes were collected. Immunohistochemistry was performed for 1) hematoxylin and eosin, 2) intrahepatic bile duct mass (IBDM) by cytokeratin-19, and 3) HDC biliary expression. We measured serum and cholangiocyte histamine levels by enzyme immunoassay. In total liver or cholangiocytes, we studied: 1) HDC and VEGF/HIF-1? expression and 2) PCNA and PKA/ERK1/2 protein expression. In vitro, cholangiocytes were stably transfected with shRNA-HDC plasmids (or control). After transfection we evaluated pPKA, pERK1/2, and cholangiocyte proliferation by immunoblots and MTT assay. In BDL HDC(-/-) mice, there was decreased IBDM, PCNA, VEGF, and HDC expression compared with BDL WT mice. Histamine levels were decreased in BDL HDC(-/-). BDL HDC(-/-) livers were void of necrosis and inflammation compared with BDL WT. PKA/ERK1/2 protein expression (increased in WT BDL) was lower in BDL HDC(-/-) cholangiocytes. In vitro, knockdown of HDC decreased proliferation and protein expression of PKA/ERK1/2 compared with control. In conclusion, loss of HDC decreases BDL-induced biliary mass and VEGF/HIF-1? expression via PKA/ERK1/2 signaling. Our data suggest that HDC is a key regulator of biliary proliferation.
