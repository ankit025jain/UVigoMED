{"id":83702,"title":"[Anti-depressant effect and mechanism of supercritical CO2 extract from Compound Chaigui Fang].","abstract":"The tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model were used to evaluate the anti-depressant effect of supercritical CO2 extract from Compound Chaigui Fang (FFCGF). A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics combined with multivariate statistical analysis was performed to explore the mechanism of FFCGF. Rats were conducted by CUMS procedure for 28 days and drugs were administrated at the same time. The body weight, sucrose preference, crossings and rearings in open-field tests were evaluated and the urine was collected simultaneously. The metabonomic profiles of rats' urine were analyzed by NMR and potential biomarkers were searched by multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that administration of FFCGF significantly decreasing the immobility time in FST and TST and improving rats' body weight, sucrose preference, crossings and rearings in CUMS, which were indication that the anti-depressant effect of FFCGF was abvious. Significant differences in the metabolic profile of the CUMS treated group and the control group were observed, which were consistent with the results of behavioral tests. Decreased levels of acetic acid, succinic acid, 2-oxidation glutaric acid and citric acid and increased glycine and pyruvic acid in urine were significantly affected by the CUMS procedure and the 6 biomarkers were reversed evidently after administration of FFCGF. These changes were suggestion that the anti-depressant mechanism of FFCGF was associated with energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272507","annotations":[{"name":"Pyruvic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.899068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Glycine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Citric acid","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.785026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.600011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.550423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.530339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.527193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.460235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.402252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.388867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.345466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.159241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Supercritical fluid","weight":0.149844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Glutaric acid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutaric_acid"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
