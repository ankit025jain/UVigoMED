{"id":19294,"title":"CE: Responding to the cholera epidemic in Haiti.","abstract":"While Haiti was still recovering from the January 12, 2010, magnitude-7 earthquake, an outbreak of cholera spread throughout the nation, soon reaching epidemic proportions. Working through the faith-based nongovernmental organization Samaritan's Purse, an NP, an epidemiologist, and a physician joined the effort to prevent the spread of disease and treat those affected. Here they describe the prevention and intervention campaigns their organization initiated, how they prepared for each, and the essential elements of their operations.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727409","annotations":[{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.808451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.613286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.56808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Nation","weight":0.539742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.494868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"January 12","weight":0.378273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_12"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.172547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0585634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Haiti cholera outbreak","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti_cholera_outbreak"},{"name":"Samaritan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"NP (complexity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"}]}
