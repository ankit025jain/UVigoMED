{"id":10471,"title":"[Effect of succinic acid derivatives and chitosan on the oxidation status of tissues in rats with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model].","abstract":"The administration of chitosan succinate and N-succinylchitosan to rats with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model damage leads to a decrease in the level of lactate (marker of ischemic injury development), parameters of biochemiluminescence (measure of free-radical oxidation intensity), and lipid peroxodation products in animal tissues as compared to untreated (pathologic) control. The obtained results show evidence of the ability of tested drugs to decrease the degree of oxidative stress manifestation under cerebral ischemia/reperfusion conditions, which is related to the positive control effect of chitosan-based drugs on the free-radical homeostasis.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649594","annotations":[{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.819078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.717984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.667554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.430793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
