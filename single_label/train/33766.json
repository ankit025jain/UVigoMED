{"id":33766,"title":"Metacarpophalangeal joint locking in 3 family members with brachymesophalangy: case report.","abstract":"We report painful locking of the metacarpophalangeal joint in a man, his mother, and his sister, all of whom have brachymesophalangy. Surgical excision of loose osteocartilaginous fragments relieved their symptoms. The fragments appeared to be unfused ossicles of the metacarpal head, unique to patients with brachymesophalangy.
