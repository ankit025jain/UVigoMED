{"id":79421,"title":"[ENT hemangiomas - a new method for their treatment].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to address intricate problems of the treatment of ENT hemangiomas. Fibro-Vein preparation (FVP) was used for the first time for the treatment of the patients presenting with the vascular tumour in ENT. The clinical application of FVP was preceded by an experiment designed to determine the minimal dose needed to induce tissue sclerosis and adhesion. Monotherapy with FVP was given to 76 patients having the ENT hemangioma. The results of the treatment give reason to state that the use of Fibro-Vein for the treatment of the patients presenting with ENT hemangioma is an effective and sparing treatment modality.
