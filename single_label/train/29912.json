{"id":29912,"title":"An examination of beliefs and opinions about drug use in relation to personal stigmatization towards drug users.","abstract":"Stigma can be harmful to drug users, particularly those in need of treatment. Beliefs and opinions about drug use may influence how individuals view or treat drug users, so research was needed to examine whether specific beliefs and opinions are related to stigma towards users. A sample of 531 adults was assessed to examine how stigmatization relates to specific beliefs and opinions about drug use. Eighty percent of the sample reported lifetime use of an illicit drug. While controlling for demographic characteristics, lifetime drug use and exposure to users, stigmatization towards users more than doubled the odds of reporting that addiction is a choice, and more than tripled the odds for reporting that marijuana and heroin are equally dangerous. Stigmatization, however, lowered the odds of reporting that drugs would be okay to use if legal. Individuals who stigmatize drug users may be under-educated about drug use; however, such individuals appear to be at low risk for use. Beliefs and opinions guided by misinformation may negatively affect users, so public health efforts are needed to educate individuals about drug use and addiction in an objective manner, and treat use as more of a health behavior and less of a moral behavior.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592661","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.483986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.472164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Moral","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
