{"id":80608,"title":"Chagas disease in the immunosuppressed patient.","abstract":"This review addresses relevant aspects of Chagas disease in the immunocompromised host. Chagas disease--one of the world's most neglected diseases-has become a global public health concern. Novel transmission modalities, such as organ transplantation, evidence of parasite persistence in chronically infected individuals--with the potential for reactivation under immunosuppression--and the prolonged survival of immunosuppressed patients call for an appraisal of the disease in this particular setting. The management and outcome of solid organ transplantation in the infected recipient with special focus on heart transplantation is addressed. The guidelines for management and the outcome of the recipients of organs from infected donors are discussed, and comments on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation are included. Finally, Chagas disease in other situations of impairment of the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and autoimmune diseases, are considered. Immunosuppression has become an increasingly frequent condition that might modify the natural history of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. A number of strategies are available for Chagas disease management in the immunosuppressed patient. First, according to recent recommendations from the health authorities in Argentina, most infected patients would benefit from being treated at diagnosis. This has not been validated for patients with different immunosuppressive disorders. A different strategy would involve treating only patients with documented reactivation (either parasitaemia or clinical manifestations). These different approaches are discussed. To reach a diagnosis of parasitaemia, monitoring is essential, either with conventional methods or with molecular techniques that are not yet available in all centres. Collaborative studies are needed to improve the level of evidence, which will allow for better guidelines.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602129","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.808084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.344321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.245896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
