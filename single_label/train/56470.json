{"id":56470,"title":"Comparative evaluation of dual Scheimpflug imaging parameters in keratoconus, early keratoconus, and normal eyes.","abstract":"To determine the efficacy of various parameters measured by dual Scheimpflug imaging technology in differentiating eyes with keratoconus or early keratoconus from normal eyes.Cornea Service, Wills Eye Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.Comparative case series.A retrospective evaluation was performed of the parameters provided by the Galilei dual Scheimpflug analyzer in keratoconus, early keratoconus, and normal eyes. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to compare the mean values and to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of these parameters.Many parameters were statistically significantly different between keratoconus and normal eyes compared with early keratoconus eyes (P<.05). Total cornea power-steep and posterior curvature-steep keratometry had the highest area under the curve (AUC) score (0.99) for differentiating keratoconus eyes from normal eyes. All anterior curvature parameters were statistically significant in differentiating keratoconus eyes from normal eyes, whereas only the anterior curvature-steep was statistically significant in differentiating early keratoconus eyes from normal eyes. The central pachymetry and thinnest pachymetry were statistically significant in differentiating keratoconus and early keratoconus eyes from normal eyes. Third-order root mean square (RMS) and total RMS had the highest AUC scores (0.83 and 0.82, respectively) for differentiating early keratoconus eyes from normal eyes.Total corneal power, anterior curvature, posterior curvature, pachymetry, and corneal aberration data generated from the dual Scheimpflug analyzer showed promising results in differentiating keratoconus and early keratoconus eyes from normal eyes.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye
