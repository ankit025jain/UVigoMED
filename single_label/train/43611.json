{"id":43611,"title":"The efficacy of liver resection for multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of liver resection for multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (MNHCC).A total of 399 patients who underwent R0 resection for HCC from 1992 to 2011 were subjected to analysis. Out of these 399 patients, 107 patients had multinodular HCC, while 292 had a single tumor.The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates of patients with MNHCC were 62.0% and 38.1% respectively. By a multivariate analysis of the survival of the 107 patients after liver resection for MNHCC, it was shown that the presence of four or more tumors and a lower serum albumin level were unfavorable prognostic factors for long-term survival. With respect to the patients with four or more HCCs, portal vein invasion was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for long-term survival. However, in patients with four or more HCCs without portal vein invasion, overall survival rates of those with preoperative serum albumin level >4.0 mg/dl and a platelet count >10(5)/mm(3) were significantly higher than those of patients with albumin <4.0mg/dl or platelet count <10(5)/mm(3) (p=0.049).Liver resection can provide a survival benefit, even for patients with multiple HCCs. Even if patients have four or more tumors without portal vein invasion and with well-preserved liver function, resection for HCC may be the treatment of choice.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778054","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.675808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.630393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.397521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.105572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"399","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/399"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"National Qualifications Framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Qualifications_Framework"},{"name":"M101 howitzer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M101_howitzer"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
