{"id":31111,"title":"Twelve-month employment intervention outcomes for drug-involved offenders.","abstract":"Employment has been identified as an important part of substance abuse treatment and is a predictor of treatment retention, treatment completion, and decreased relapse. Although employment interventions have been designed for substance abusers, few interventions have focused specifically on drug-involved offenders.The purpose of this study was to examine employment outcomes for drug-involved offenders who received a tailored employment intervention.In a randomized controlled trial, baseline and follow-up data were collected from 500 drug-involved offenders who were enrolled in a drug court program. Participants were randomly assigned to drug court as usual (control group) or to the employment intervention in addition to drug court.Intent-to-treat analyses found that the tailored intervention was associated only with more days of paid employment at follow-up (210.1 vs. 199.9 days). When focusing on those with greater employment assistance needs, a work trajectory analyses, which took into account participants' pre-baseline employment pattern (negative or positive), revealed that intervention group participants had higher rates of employment (82.1% vs. 64.1%), more days paid for employment (188.9 vs. 157.0 days), and more employment income ($8623 vs. $6888) at follow-up than control group participants.The present study adds to the growing substance abuse and employment literature. It demonstrates the efficacy of an innovative employment intervention tailored for drug-involved offenders by showing positive changes in 12-month employment outcomes, most strongly for those who have not had recent employment success.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405160","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.876008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.649368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.575423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.289281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Drug court","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_court"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
