{"id":38010,"title":"Significance of higher-order chromatin architecture for neuronal function and dysfunction.","abstract":"Recent studies in neurons indicate that the large-scale chromatin architectural framework, including chromosome territories or lamina-associated chromatin, undergoes dynamic changes that represent an emergent level of regulation of neuronal gene-expression. This phenomenon has been implicated in neuronal differentiation, long-term potentiation, seizures, and disorders of neural plasticity such as Rett syndrome and epilepsy.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456745","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Rett syndrome","weight":0.712931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.710501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.639645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.419121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.411784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.278019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.144071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Dynamics (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Enterprise Architecture framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architecture_framework"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"}]}
