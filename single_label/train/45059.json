{"id":45059,"title":"Thymosin beta 4 and thymosin beta 10 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Thymosin beta 4 (T?4) and thymosin beta 10 (T?10) are two members of the beta-thymosin family involved in many cellular processes such as cellular motility, angiogenesis, inflammation, cell survival and wound healing. Recently, a role for beta-thymosins has been proposed in the process of carcinogenesis as both peptides were detected in several types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern of T?4 and T?10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To this end, the expression pattern of both peptides was analyzed in liver samples obtained from 23 subjects diagnosed with HCC. Routinely formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded liver samples were immunostained by indirect immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antibodies to T?4 and T?10. Immunoreactivity for T?4 and T?10 was detected in the liver parenchyma of the surrounding tumor area. Both peptides showed an increase in granular reactivity from the periportal to the periterminal hepatocytes. Regarding HCC, T?4 reactivity was detected in 7/23 cases (30%) and T?10 reactivity in 22/23 (97%) cases analyzed, adding HCC to human cancers that express these beta-thymosins. Intriguing finding was seen looking at the reactivity of both peptides in tumor cells infiltrating the surrounding liver. Where T?10 showed a strong homogeneous expression, was T?4 completely absent in cells undergoing stromal invasion. The current study shows expression of both beta-thymosins in HCC with marked differences in their degree of expression and frequency of immunoreactivity. The higher incidence of T?10 expression and its higher reactivity in tumor cells involved in stromal invasion indicate a possible major role for T?10 in HCC progression.
