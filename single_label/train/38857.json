{"id":38857,"title":"Atrial shunts: presentation, investigation, and management, including recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging.","abstract":"Atrial shunts are a common finding in both paediatric and adult populations. Recent developments in advanced imaging have widened the options for diagnosis and evaluation of such shunts. This paper reviews the various types of interatrial communications, discusses the features of clinical presentation in adults and children, and provides an overview of the clinical assessment including physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Focus will be placed on recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging that may improve the non-invasive evaluation of atrial shunts.
