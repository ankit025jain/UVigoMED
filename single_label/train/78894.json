{"id":78894,"title":"[Gene therapy and stem cells for the inner ear: a review].","abstract":"Within the field of otolaryngology, the inner ear is perhaps the most important target for which stem cell and gene therapy may comprise elements of primary intervention strategies in the future. As it has done in the past, sensorineural hearing loss still represents a major therapeutic challenge-and it will continue to do so in the future. Current management strategies are not cause-orientated. Since the first experiments aimed at developing a middle ear-specific gene-based therapy by Fujiyoshi in 1994, several new discoveries have been made. In the laboratory, advances in the fields of genetics, molecular signalling, stem cell biology and hair cell development and regeneration have been made. Through these advances, the potential roll of cellular and intracellular tools for the future treatment of hearing loss has been recognized. This paper comprises a review of the current status of important areas of research.
