{"id":74322,"title":"Robot assisted laparoscopic excision of a paraganglioma: new therapeutic approach.","abstract":"The Paraganglioma is the most common extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma arising from neural crest (1) (It will better to write: The paraganglioma is an extra-adrenal pheocromocytoma arising from the neural crest. 10% of pheocromocytomas are extra-adrenal and can arise form chromaffin tissue derived from primitive neuroectoderm). Minimally invasive techniques allow surgeons to perform the procedure without wide exposure and mobilization of intra abdominal organs. To our knowledge we present the third case of robotic excision of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856498","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.6764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.556033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.520865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.469015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Neural crest","weight":0.288889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_crest"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Paraganglioma","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraganglioma"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Neuroectoderm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroectoderm"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Crest (heraldry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)"},{"name":"Medullary chromaffin cell","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_chromaffin_cell"}]}
