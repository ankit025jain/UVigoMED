{"id":66211,"title":"Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate AIDS to detect lesion progression.","abstract":"Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an accurate anatomical assessment of the tumor and its local staging. Herein, we report a case of intermediate-risk prostatic adenocarcinoma, initially followed on active surveillance, which upgraded from Gleason 7 (3 + 4) to Gleason 8 (4 + 4) on transrectal ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy after progression of MR spectroscopic findings and review of the role of multiparametric MRI in the follow-up of patients with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance.
