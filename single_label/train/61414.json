{"id":61414,"title":"ITMIG consensus statement on the use of the WHO histological classification of thymoma and thymic carcinoma: refined definitions, histological criteria, and reporting.","abstract":"The 2004 version of the World Health Organization classification subdivides thymic epithelial tumors into A, AB, B1, B2, and B3 (and rare other) thymomas and thymic carcinomas (TC). Due to a morphological continuum between some thymoma subtypes and some morphological overlap between thymomas and TC, a variable proportion of cases may pose problems in classification, contributing to the poor interobserver reproducibility in some studies.To overcome this problem, hematoxylin-eosin-stained and immunohistochemically processed sections of prototypic, \"borderland,\" and \"combined\" thymomas and TC (n = 72) were studied by 18 pathologists at an international consensus slide workshop supported by the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group.Consensus was achieved on refined criteria for decision making at the A/AB borderland, the distinction between B1, B2, and B3 thymomas and the separation of B3 thymomas from TCs. \"Atypical type A thymoma\" is tentatively proposed as a new type A thymoma variant. New reporting strategies for tumors with more than one histological pattern are proposed.These guidelines can set the stage for reproducibility studies and the design of a clinically meaningful grading system for thymic epithelial tumors.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722150","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.388129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Thymoma","weight":0.376389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymoma"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.344385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.214447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.127058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"March (territory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_(territory)"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Banana cultivar groups","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_cultivar_groups"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Separation of powers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Intel Core (microarchitecture)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_(microarchitecture)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
