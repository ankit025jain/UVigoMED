{"id":24429,"title":"[Has the discovery of Helicobacter pylori actually made a revolution in gastroenterology?].","abstract":"Part 1 of this paper presents a brief description of the results of 25 year investigations of H. pylori infection and its contribution to the development of gastroduodenal pathology (chronic hepatitis, ulcer disease, stomach cancer, gastric maltoma) with reference to its diagnostics, strategy and efficacy of eradication therapy. Part 2 contains arguments and facts that contradict opinions in favour of the leading role of H. pylori infection in pathogenesis of major gastro-duodenal disorders as well as results of the studies of normal and anomalous gastric mucosal microflora comprising numerous bacteria, besides H. pylori, exhibiting such properties as adhesiveness, invasiveness (unlike H. pylori), virulence, and urease activity. The causes behind the failure of eradication therapy are discussed with reference to the decrease of its effectiveness to the critical level attributable largely to misjudgements of the authors of Maastricht recommendations.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437178","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.635017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.275022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Russian Revolution (1917)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_(1917)"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Veganism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism"},{"name":"Gastroduodenal artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroduodenal_artery"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
