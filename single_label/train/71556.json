{"id":71556,"title":"Expression of the hypoxia-inducible monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 is increased in triple negative breast cancer and correlates independently with clinical outcome.","abstract":"(18)Fluor-deoxy-glucose PET-scanning of glycolytic metabolism is being used for staging in many tumors however its impact on prognosis has never been studied in breast cancer.Glycolytic and hypoxic markers: glucose transporter (GLUT1), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 (MCT1, 4), MCT accessory protein basigin and lactate-dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in two cohorts of breast cancer comprising 643 node-negative and 127 triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) respectively.In the 643 node-negative breast tumor cohort with a median follow-up of 124 months, TNBC were the most glycolytic (?70%), followed by Her-2 (?50%) and RH-positive cancers (?30%). Tumoral MCT4 staining (without stromal staining) was a strong independent prognostic factor for metastasis-free survival (HR=0.47, P=0.02) and overall-survival (HR=0.38, P=0.002). These results were confirmed in the independent cohort of 127 cancer patients.Glycolytic markers are expressed in all breast tumors with highest expression occurring in TNBC. MCT4, the hypoxia-inducible lactate/H(+) symporter demonstrated the strongest deleterious impact on survival. We propose that MCT4 serves as a new prognostic factor in node-negative breast cancer and can perhaps act soon as a theranostic factor considering the current pharmacological development of MCT4 inhibitors.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25058459","annotations":[{"name":"Triple-negative breast cancer","weight":0.902825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-negative_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.743088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.515061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Carbonic anhydrase","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.192779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Glucose transporter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_transporter"},{"name":"GLUT1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT1"},{"name":"Symporter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symporter"},{"name":"Factor IX","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_IX"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}]}
