{"id":30982,"title":"A 5-year follow-up of depressed and bipolar patients with alcohol use disorder in an Irish population.","abstract":"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and affective disorders commonly co-occur, and this co-occurrence is mutually detrimental. To date, few long-term outcome studies exist involving patients with these comorbid disorders. We wished to determine treatment outcomes 5 years after inpatient integrated treatment in patients with these co-occurring disorders, and identify prognostic factors associated with long-term outcome.Two hundred and five depressed and bipolar patients with AUD who completed an inpatient integrated treatment program for dual diagnosis were assessed at baseline, posttreatment discharge, and at 3 months, 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years after treatment.The retention rate at 3 months postdischarge was 95.6%, 75.6% at 6 months, 70.2% at 2 years, and 55.6% at 5 years. Depression, elation, anxiety, and craving scores all fell over the 5-year period, as did the drinking outcome measures in both the depressed and bipolar alcoholics. Each of the primary drinking outcome measures had independent prognostic factors: abstinence at 2 years predicted abstinence at 5 years; number of drinking days at 6 months and 2 years predicted number of drinking days at 5 years; number of drinks per drinking day at 6 months and 2 years predicted number of drinks per drinking day at 5 years. Moreover, the majority of nonabstinent light drinkers at 3 months, who had significantly reduced their mean weekly alcohol consumption since baseline, remained light drinkers at 5 years and very few went on to be heavy drinkers. Indeed, if they did alter category by 5 years, they tended to become abstinent.Dual diagnosis of AUD and depression or bipolar disorder may be treated successfully together with intensive intervention and follow-up, and various prognostic factors emerge. Early abstinence predicts later abstinence, and the vast majority of those who achieve light drinking early in recovery remain light drinkers or become abstinent at 5 years.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428168","annotations":[{"name":"Dual diagnosis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_diagnosis"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.875758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.614623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.510535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.444757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.395972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Affective spectrum","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_spectrum"},{"name":"Australian dollar","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Happiness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Irish people","weight":0.0464746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Desegregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desegregation"},{"name":"Independent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
