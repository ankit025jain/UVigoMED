{"id":25034,"title":"Morpho-functional features of the radial artery: implications for use as a coronary bypass conduit.","abstract":"Since its reintroduction in the early 1990s the radial artery has gained a major role in coronary surgery, currently representing a valid alternative to the right internal thoracic artery as a second arterial graft. However, its peculiar morphologic and functional features have both surgical and clinical critical implications that must be taken into account. In this review we summarize the current totality of evidence on the biologic characteristics of the radial artery, such as its histopathology, vasoreactivity, and remodeling, and discuss their potential implications for use as a coronary bypass conduit.
