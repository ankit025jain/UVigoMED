{"id":66256,"title":"Patterns of left ventricular remodeling among patients with essential and secondary hypertension.","abstract":"High blood pressure causes left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a negative prognostic factor among hypertensive patients.To assess left ventricular geometric remodeling patterns in patients with essential hypertension or with hypertension secondary to parenchymal renal disease.We analyzed data from echocardiograms performed in 250 patients with essential hypertension (150 females) and 100 patients with secondary hypertension (60 females). The interventricular septum and the left ventricular posterior wall thickness were measured in the parasternal long-axis. Left ventricular mass was calculated using the Devereaux formula.The most common remodeling type in females and males with essential hypertension were eccentric and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (cLVH), respectively. Among patients with secondary arterial hypertension, cLVH was most commonly observed in both genders. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was higher among patients with secondary hypertension. The left ventricular mass index and the relative left ventricular wall thickness were higher in males and also in the secondary hypertension group. Age, blood pressure values and the duration of hypertension, influenced remodeling patterns.We documented a higher prevalence of LVH among patients with secondary hypertension. The type of ventricular remodeling depends on gender, age, type of hypertension, blood pressure values and the duration of hypertension.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728428","annotations":[{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.623267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.59084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Ventricular remodeling","weight":0.40098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_remodeling"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.260174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0890404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Secondary hypertension","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_hypertension"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
