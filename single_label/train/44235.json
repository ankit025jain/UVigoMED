{"id":44235,"title":"The outcome of liver resection and lymphadenectomy for hilar lymph node involvement in colorectal cancer liver metastases.","abstract":"Hepatic hilar lymph node (HLN) involvement is considered as a poor prognostic factor during liver resection in colorectal liver metastases (CLM). The purpose of this study is to identify the clinical factors that distinguish HLN-positive patients from those who are hilar lymph node negative and to evaluate the frequency of macroscopic involvement of hepatic HLN, to investigate the impact of HLN involvement on survival after resection for CLM with lymphadenectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy.Between January 2000 and August 2012, 73 selected CLM patients underwent liver resections with lymphadenectomy in the Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery Department I of Beijing Cancer Hospital. Clinical data, surgical outcome, and prognosis after operation of patients with HLN involvement were compared with that of patients without HLN involvement.Of the 73 patients who underwent liver resections with lymphadenectomy, 12 (16.4 %) patients had HLN involvement identified by pathology. Compared with patients without HLN involvement, the frequency of lymph nodes metastasis for primary tumor was significantly higher in HLN-positive patients (p?=?0.023). For CLM patients with and without HLN involvement, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 16.2 and 37.1 %, respectively (p?=?0.04). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 0 and 32.9 % (p?=?0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that involved resected HLN was an independent risk factor for overall survival.We should suspect HLN involvement in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases when they have regional lymph nodes of primary tumor metastasis. Liver resection with HLN dissection might offer a unique curative opportunity for CLM patients with HLN involvement.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743847","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.786849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.780056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Hilum (anatomy)","weight":0.54162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"United States presidential election, 2000","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
