{"id":31258,"title":"Pregnenolone can protect the brain from cannabis intoxication.","abstract":"Pregnenolone is considered the inactive precursor of all steroid hormones, and its potential functional effects have been largely uninvestigated. The administration of the main active principle of Cannabis sativa (marijuana), ?(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), substantially increases the synthesis of pregnenolone in the brain via activation of the type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor. Pregnenolone then, acting as a signaling-specific inhibitor of the CB1 receptor, reduces several effects of THC. This negative feedback mediated by pregnenolone reveals a previously unknown paracrine/autocrine loop protecting the brain from CB1 receptor overactivation that could open an unforeseen approach for the treatment of cannabis intoxication and addiction.","date":"2014-01-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24385629","annotations":[{"name":"Tetrahydrocannabinol","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"},{"name":"Cannabis sativa","weight":0.820698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Pregnenolone","weight":0.709087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnenolone"},{"name":"Steroid hormone","weight":0.703602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.6648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Effects of cannabis","weight":0.646692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Cannabinoid receptor type 1","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1"},{"name":"Active ingredient","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Negative feedback","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback"}]}
