{"id":88344,"title":"Possible way to reduce fracture rates in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury?","abstract":"Lower extremity fractures in men with spinal cord injury (SCI) are a major problem. The use of thiazide diuretics, a simple and safe intervention, may be effective in reducing the risk of fracture in patients with traumatic SCI. Furthermore, thiazide diuretics have an added benefit of reducing kidney stone formation.
