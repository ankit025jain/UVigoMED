{"id":24277,"title":"Alteration of the phenotypic and pathogenic patterns of Burkholderia pseudomallei that persist in a soil environment.","abstract":"Melioidosis is caused by the soil-borne pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei. To investigate whether the distinct phenotypic and virulent characteristics result from environmental adaptations in the soil or from the host body, two pairs of isogenic strains were generated by passages in soil or mice. After cultivation in soil, the levels of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, biofilm formation, flagellar expression, and ultrastructure were altered in the bacteria. Uniformly fatal melioidosis developed as a result of infection with mouse-derived strains; however, the survival rates of mice infected with soil-derived strains prolonged. After primary infection or reinfection with soil-derived strains, the mice developed a low degree of bacterial hepatitis and bacterial colonization in the liver and bone marrow compared with mice that were infected with isogenic or heterogenic mouse-derived strains. We suggest that specific phenotypic and pathogenic patterns can be induced through infection with B. pseudomallei that has been cultured in different (soil versus mouse) environments.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445207","annotations":[{"name":"Soil","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Flagellum","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.71151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.709729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Colony (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.649368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Burkholderia pseudomallei","weight":0.518984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkholderia_pseudomallei"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.345814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Burkholderia","weight":0.11851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkholderia"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Melioidosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melioidosis"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"}]}
