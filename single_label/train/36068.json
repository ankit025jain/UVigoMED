{"id":36068,"title":"Contact hypersensitivity to haptens of the European standard series and corticosteroid series in the population of adolescents and adults with atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"Until recently, it was thought that in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), contact hypersensitivity phenomenon occurs less frequently than in the general population because of the impaired cellular immune response.The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of contact dermatitis in the population of patients with AD.A total of 39 patients with clinical diagnosis of AD during remission were patch tested with 28 European Baseline Series allergens and 8 corticosteroids allergens in different concentrations and media. Twenty-nine (74.3%) patients were female and 10 (25.6%) patients were male. Thirty-three (84.6%) patients were older than 18 years. The mean duration of AD was 20 years.Nineteen (48%) patients had an allergic reaction to at least 1 European Standard Series allergen, and 5 (12.8%) patients had an allergic reaction to at least 1 corticosteroid. The most common allergens giving positive results were nickel sulfate (28.2%), potassium dichromate (20.5%), cobalt chloride (12.8%), and phenylenediamine, budesonide, betamethasone, clobetasol, and dexamethasone (7.7% each).This study shows that allergic contact hypersensitivity is common among patients with AD and affects up to 40% of cases. Contact allergy to corticosteroids becomes a serious problem in the treatment of chronic inflammatory dermatoses such as AD.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal
