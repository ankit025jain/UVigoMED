{"id":41335,"title":"Evaluation of pharmacokinetics and safety of ponatinib in subjects with chronic hepatic impairment and matched healthy subjects.","abstract":"This study evaluated the effects of chronic hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib.Subjects (n = 16) had Child-Pugh class A (mild, n = 6), B (moderate, n = 6), or C (severe, n = 4) hepatic impairment and were matched with healthy controls (n = 8). Each subject received a single oral dose of ponatinib 30 mg under fasting conditions, and PK parameters were assessed in blood samples collected through 96 h post-dose.Ponatinib maximum plasma concentrations (C max) were observed after 5-6 h in Child-Pugh A, Child-Pugh B, and healthy subjects, and after ~3 h in Child-Pugh C subjects. The estimated % geometric mean ratios for C max, area under the plasma concentration-time curves from time zero to last observation (AUC0-t ) and to infinity (AUC0-?) suggested a slightly lower exposure in Child-Pugh B (61.4, 89.1, and 90.6%, respectively) and Child-Pugh C subjects (62.8, 77.1, and 79.4%) versus healthy subjects. Child-Pugh A subjects had similar estimated % geometric mean ratio for C max (106.7%), and slightly greater estimated % geometric mean ratios for AUC0-t (133.0%) and AUC0-? (122.8%), versus healthy subjects. Mean elimination half-life was extended in subjects with hepatic impairment (43-47 vs 36 h). Ponatinib was generally well tolerated. A single serious AE (pancreatitis) in the Child-Pugh C group resolved with treatment.As no major differences in ponatinib single-dose PK were observed in patients with hepatic impairment versus healthy subjects, a reduction of ponatinib starting dose in these patients is not necessary, but caution is recommended when administering ponatinib to these patients.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934866","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.533312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.527656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.431787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.308649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.150553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Infinity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"American English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"}]}
