{"id":7228,"title":"HB-EGF augments the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to attenuate intestinal injury.","abstract":"We have previously demonstrated that heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration protect the intestines from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vivo, with amniotic fluid-derived MSC (AF-MSC) being more efficacious than bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC). The goal of the current study was to determine whether the protective effects of HB-EGF were from direct effects on MSC or via alternative mechanisms.Murine MSC were transfected with an HB-EGF plasmid or control plasmid by electroporation. Mice were subjected to segmental intestinal I/R injury and received either BM-MSC or AF-MSC either with or without exogenous HB-EGF, or BM-MSC or AF-MSC that endogenously over-expressed HB-EGF. MSC engraftment, intestinal histologic injury, and intestinal permeability were quantified.There was increased MSC engraftment into injured compared to uninjured intestine. HB-EGF increased AF-MSC engraftment into injured intestine. Administration of HB-EGF and MSC improved intestinal histology and intestinal permeability after I/R injury, with AF-MSC being most efficacious. The effect of HB-EGF on MSC was similar when the growth factor was administered exogenously, or when it was overexpressed endogenously.The effect of HB-EGF on AF-MSC was similar with both exogenous administration and endogenous overexpression of the growth factor, implying that HB-EGF has a direct effect on AF-MSC. This information may assist in guiding potential future AF-MSC-based therapies for patients at risk of intestinal ischemic injuries.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888839","annotations":[{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.870187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.825552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Electroporation","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.716491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.308635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.0325898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin-binding_EGF-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Direct effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_effect"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Leaky gut syndrome","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut_syndrome"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
