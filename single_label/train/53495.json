{"id":53495,"title":"Inter-operator variability of electrodermal measure at Jing Well points using AcuGraph 3.","abstract":"Recent studies have found that many factors, both biological and operator induced, influence electrodermal measurements. Here, we report on operator variability for a series of measurements made by four operators at Jing-Well points on 132 individuals of both sexes (68 males and 64 females) by using the AcuGraph 3 'Digital Meridian Imaging Tool': Operator 1 (16 males, 12 females), Operator 2 (18 males, 13 females), Operator 3 (15 males, 21 females), and Operator 4 (19 males, 18 females). The individuals studied were attending a yoga therapy program for type 2 diabetes mellitus and were assessed on the 1st day of treatment. Large inter-operator variations in overall acumeridian energy readings were observed. For individual meridians, the AcuGraph 3 measure differed by up to 42 points for minimum values and 67 points for maximum values. After normalization, the data showed similar patterns between different acumeridians. This suggested that variations were caused by operators applying different pressures when making measurements. Thus, inter-operator variability should be considered when interpreting electrodermal measurements made by several different operators. Unless inter-operator variability is taken into account, actual values may not have meaning; only then can readings for the same population taken by different operators be evaluated correctly.
