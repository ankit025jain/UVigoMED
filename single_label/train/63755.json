{"id":63755,"title":"The limit of anemia tolerance during hyperoxic ventilation with pure oxygen in anesthetized domestic pigs.","abstract":"During acellular replacement of an acute blood loss, hyperoxic ventilation (HV) increases the amount of O2 physically dissolved in the plasma and thereby improves O2 supply to the tissues. While this effect could be demonstrated for HV with inspiratory O2 fraction (FiO2) 0.6, it was unclear whether HV with pure oxygen (FiO2 1.0) would have an additional effect on the physiological limit of acute normovolemic anemia.Seven anesthetized domestic pigs were ventilated with FiO2 1.0 and subjected to an isovolemic hemodilution protocol. Blood was drawn and replaced by a 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution (130/0.4) until a sudden decrease of total body O2 consumption (VO2) indicated the onset of O2 supply dependency (primary endpoint). The corresponding hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was defined as 'critical Hb' (Hbcrit). Secondary endpoints were parameters of myocardial function, central hemodynamics, O2 transport and tissue oxygenation.HV with FiO2 1.0 enabled a large blood-for-HES exchange (156 ± 28% of the circulating blood volume) until Hbcrit was met at 1.3 ± 0.3 g/dl. After termination of the hemodilution protocol, the contribution of O2 physically dissolved in the plasma to O2 delivery and VO2 had significantly increased from 11.7 ± 2 to 44.2 ± 9.7% and from 29.1 ± 4.2 to 66.2 ± 11.7%, respectively. However, at Hbcrit, cardiovascular performance was found to have severely deteriorated.HV with FiO2 1.0 maintains O2 supply to tissues during extensive blood-for-HES exchange. In acute situations, where profound anemia must be tolerated (e.g. bridging an acute blood loss until red blood cells become available for transfusion), O2 physically dissolved in the plasma becomes an essential source of oxygen. However, compromised cardiovascular performance might require additional treatment.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
