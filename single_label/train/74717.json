{"id":74717,"title":"Deficiency of GDNF Receptor GFR?1 in Alzheimer's Neurons Results in Neuronal Death.","abstract":"We have recently developed aged cortical neuron cultures from autopsied human brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD). During the culturing process, we found that glutamatergic cortical neurons from the AD brain lacked a response to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), including no axonal regrowth, and were starting to undergo apoptosis. Here we showed that, in cortical neurons from age- and gender-matched cognitively normal control (NC) subjects (NC neurons), GDNF enhanced the expression of GDNF family receptor subtype ?1 (GFR?1), but not the other three subtypes (GFR?2, GFR?3, and GFR?4), whereas GDNF failed to induce GFR?1 expression in cortical neurons from the AD brain (AD neurons). The exogenous introduction of GFR?1, but not of its binding partner ?1-neural cell adhesion molecule, or RET into AD neurons restored the effect of GDNF on neuronal survival. Moreover, between NC and AD neurons, the AMPA receptor blocker CNQX and the NMDA receptor blocker AP-5 had opposite effects on the GFR?1 expression induced by GDNF. In NC neurons, the presence of glutamate receptors was necessary for GDNF-linked GFR?1 expression, while in AD neurons the absence of glutamate receptors was required for GFR?1 expression by GDNF stimulation. These results suggest that, in AD neurons, specific impairments of GFR?1, which may be linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission, shed light on developing potential therapeutic strategies for AD by upregulation of GFR?1 expression.
