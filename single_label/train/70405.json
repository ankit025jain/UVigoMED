{"id":70405,"title":"[Construction and expression of the targeting super-antigen EGF-SEA fusion gene].","abstract":"To construct expression vector for the SEA-EGF fusion gene.Clone the SEA gene and the EGF gene segment with PCR and RT-PCR independently, and connect this two genes by the bridge PCR. Insert the fusion gene EGF-SEA into the expression vector PET-44. Induced the secretion of the fusion protein SEA-EGF by the antileptic.The gene fragment encoding EGF and SEA mature peptide was successfully cloned. The fusion gene EGF-SEA was successfully constructed and was inserted into expression vector.The new recombinant expression vector for fusion gene EGF-SEA is specific for head and neck cancer, laid the foundation for the further study of fusion protein SEA-EGF targeting immune therapy in head and neck tumors.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195273","annotations":[{"name":"Expression vector","weight":0.874535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_vector"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.485866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.438941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.399301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.398854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Superantigen","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superantigen"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0902121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Foundation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Insert key","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insert_key"}]}
