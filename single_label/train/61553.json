{"id":61553,"title":"Redefining essential care in lymphoedema.","abstract":"The awareness, diagnosis and management of chronic oedema and lymphoedema is improving. The enduring treatment format for the condition has always been regarded as the 'fourÂ cornerstones' of care for maintenance therapy in the UK. However, with changes in technology, availability of additional treatments and increased research and studies, this baseline is changing.
