{"id":83260,"title":"[Unilateral pedicle screw fixation and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion through paraspinal muscle approach for recurrent lumbar disc herniation combined with lumbar instability].","abstract":"To explore the clinical effects of unilateral pedicle screw fixation and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) through paraspinal muscle approach for recurrent lumbar disc herniation combined with lumbar instability.A total of 35 patients with recurrent lumbar disc herniation combined with lumbar instability were treated between March 2008 and May 2010, including 15 patients managed by the paraspinal muscle approach with unilateral pedicle screw fixation and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) (unilateral fixation group) and 20 patients by the posterior midline approach with bilateral pedicle screw fixation and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (bilateral fixation group). Operation time and intraoperative blood loss were observed, preoperative and postoperative JOA score and VAS score in low back pain and legs pain, the interbody fusion condition were compared between two groups.All patients were followed up from 6 to 30 months with an average 16.8 months. All clinical symptoms had obviously improved postoperatively. X-rays showed good interbody fusion (only 1 case did not obtain fusion in bilateral fixation group) without cage displacement or settlement and implant loosening or breakage. There was significant difference in operation time and the intraoperative blood loss between two groups (P < 0.05). Postoperative JOA score had obviously decreased than preoperative one (P < 0.05). At 1 week after surgery, there was significant difference in VAS score of low back pain between two groups and there was no significant difference in VAS score of legs pain between two groups (P > 0.05); at final follow-up, there was no significant difference in VAS score of low back pain and legs pain between two groups (P > 0.05).Two methods both can obtain satisfactory effect in treating recurrent lumbar disc herniation combined with lumbar instability. Through the paraspinal muscle approach with unilateral pedicle screw fixation and TLIF has advantages of smaller surgical incision, shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, faster relief in low back pain after operation, etc.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571650","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.714032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.534693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.356305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hymenotomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenotomy"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_Preservation_Act_of_1970"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Human settlement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Commissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissure"}]}
