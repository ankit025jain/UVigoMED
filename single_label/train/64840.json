{"id":64840,"title":"[Antibacterial therapy of patients with chronic prostatitis: finding a way out of therapeutic \"deadlock\"].","abstract":"Treatment of patients with chronic prostatitis is one of the most urgent problems of modern urology. According to most of the existing recommendations, fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice in treatment of prostatitis. Recently, however, many researchers have noted the increasing role of intracellular pathogens, and high activity of macrolides and tetracyclines against these pathogens. This article provides an overview of the literature on recommended and promising antibiotics used in the treatment of patients with chronic prostatitis.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211937","annotations":[{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.643407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.470812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Tetracycline antibiotics","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics"},{"name":"Intracellular parasite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular_parasite"},{"name":"Chronic bacterial prostatitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bacterial_prostatitis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
