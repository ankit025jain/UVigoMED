{"id":37465,"title":"Reverse Ponseti-type treatment for children with congenital vertical talus: comparison between idiopathic and teratological patients.","abstract":"Children with congenital vertical talus (CVT) have been treated with extensive soft-tissue releases, with a high rate of complications. Recently, reverse Ponseti-type casting followed by percutaneous reduction and fixation has been described, with excellent results in separate cohorts of children with CVT, of either idiopathic or teratological aetiology. There are currently no studies that compare the outcome in these two types. We present a prospective cohort of 13 children (21 feet) with CVT of both idiopathic and teratological aetiology, in which this technique has been used. Clinical, radiological and parent-reported outcomes were obtained at a mean follow-up of 36 months (8 to 57). Six children (nine feet) had associated neuromuscular conditions or syndromes; the condition was idiopathic in seven children (12 feet). Initial correction was achieved in all children, with significant improvement in all radiological parameters. Recurrence was seen in ten feet. Modification of the technique to include limited capsulotomy at the initial operation may reduce the risk of recurrence. The reverse Ponseti-type technique is effective in the initial correction of CVT of both idiopathic and teratological aetiology. Recurrence is a problem in both these groups, with higher rates than first reported in the original paper. However, these rates are less than those reported after open surgical release.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493197","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Teratology","weight":0.793923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.737514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.532243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.523759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.446357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Scree","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree"},{"name":"Continuously variable transmission","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"}]}
