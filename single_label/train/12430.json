{"id":12430,"title":"Analgesic efficacy of small-molecule angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonists in a rat model of antiretroviral toxic polyneuropathy.","abstract":"Individuals infected with the HIV and taking certain antiretroviral drugs to suppress viral replication have a high prevalence of neuropathic pain that is not alleviated by analgesic/adjuvant drugs that are often efficacious for the relief of other types of neuropathic pain. There is therefore a great need for new analgesics to alleviate the pain of antiretroviral toxic neuropathy (ATN). Small-molecule angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) antagonists, with ?1000-fold selectivity over the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, produced analgesia in the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve rat model of peripheral nerve trauma. Hence, the present study was designed to assess their analgesic efficacy in a rat model of ATN. The analgesic efficacy of small-molecule AT2R antagonists (EMA200 and EMA300) was assessed in a rat model of dideoxycytidine (ddC)-induced ATN. Single intraperitoneal bolus doses of EMA200 (0.3-10 mg/kg) induced dose-dependent analgesia in ddC-rats; the mean ED50 was 3.2 mg/kg. Twice-daily intraperitoneal administration of EMA300 at 30 mg/kg to ddC-rats for 3 days produced significant analgesia on days 2 and 3 of the treatment period. Therefore, small-molecule AT2R antagonists should be investigated further as novel analgesics for the relief of ATN.
