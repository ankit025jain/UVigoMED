{"id":47305,"title":"Profiles of serum microRNAs; miR-125b-5p and miR223-3p serve as novel biomarkers for HBV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Recently, circulating miRNAs have been reported as promising biomarkers for various pathologic conditions including cancer. Certain microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown early diagnostic potential for many types of cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of certain serum/plasma miRNAs as novel non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For this reason, the expression levels of 24 miRNA (let-7c, miR-92a-3p, 423-5p, 150-5p, 223-3p, 125b-5p, 342-3p, miR-206, 122-5p, 375, 223-5p, 10a-5p, 23b-5p, 99a-5p, 23a-5p, 10a-3p, 122-3p, 125b-1-3p, 23b-3p, 125b-2-3p, 23a-3p, 92a-1-5p, 92a-2-5p, 99a-3p) were analyzed in plasma of patients with chronic hepatitis B, HBV-positive cirrhosis and HBV-positive HCC and compared with control group samples. Totally 94 plasma samples; 28 control and 66 patient plasma (24 CHB, 22 HBV-positive cirrhosis, 20 HBV-positive HCC) and were included in this study. The expression levels of 24 miRNAs were detected for all control and patient group plasma samples by qRT-PCR using BioMarkâ„¢ 96.96 Dynamic Array (Fluidigm Corporation) system. The expression levels of miR-125b-5p were detected 2.85 fold, 2.46 fold and 1.89 fold (p = 0.01513, p = 0.0009440, p = 0.0001446) up regulated in CHB, HBV-positive cirrhosis and HBV-positive HCC, respectively when compared versus control group individually by Mann-Whitney U test. The expression levels of miR-223-3p were detected 5.55 fold, 13.88 fold and 12.65 fold (p = 0.01513, p = 0.0009440, p = 0.0001446) down regulated in same comparisons. When all groups were compared versus control group by one-way ANOVA test, the expression levels of miR-223-3p were also found statistically significant (p < 0.05). Although not statistically significant, miR-125b-5p tended to be upregulated. (p = 0.07192). These results significantly imply that miR-125b-5p and miR223-3p could be used as novel non-invasive biomarkers of HBV-positive HCC in very early, even at CHB stage of liver disease.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595450","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.721288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.532612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.365184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.340999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.283436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.181499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
