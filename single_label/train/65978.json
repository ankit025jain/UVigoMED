{"id":65978,"title":"Contemporary gender-specific outcomes in Germany after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.","abstract":"In 2008, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) was the 8th most common cause of death in Germany. An increasing body of evidence suggests differences in the presentation and prognosis of UCB between genders. Large population-based and multi-institutional studies have found a higher incidence of UCB in men, while women treated with radical cystectomy (RC) have shown unfavorable outcomes compared to their male counterparts. Indeed, it is important to note that UCB incidence and outcomes have regional and country-specific variability. These distinct country and gender-specific differences must be considered in patient counseling, treatment decisions, and UCB management. This review summarizes the contemporary literature regarding the impact of gender on UCB outcomes, focusing on patients treated with RC in Germany. We evaluated the most current literature regarding gender-specific differences in UCB incidence, treatment patterns, and oncological outcomes, including pathological stage distribution and survival.
