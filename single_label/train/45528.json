{"id":45528,"title":"Expanding indications for ESD: mucosal disease (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract).","abstract":"Endoscopic resection is now considered a curative procedure for early gastric cancer. In Japan, it has increasingly replaced surgical resection for this indication, although in the West it has not been universally accepted as a first-line treatment. Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection has been increasingly applied to colorectal disease, although it has not become a standard therapeutic procedure for early colorectal carcinoma because of its technical difficulty, the relatively long procedure time required, and the risk of complications, such as perforation and bleeding.
