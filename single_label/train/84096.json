{"id":84096,"title":"[Genetic stability study on autotetraploid plant of Dioscorea zingiberensis].","abstract":"To study the genetic stability of autotetraploid plant of Dioscorea zingiberensis.The chromosome of root-tip was determined by photomicroscope, and the agronomic characters were observed in the period of stable growth. The protein content was determined and the experiment of protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out. Furthemore, the diosgenin content was determined and compared.The chromosome number of autotetraploid plantlet was 2n = 4x = 40. The agronomic characters showed typical autotetraploid characteristics. The contents of diosgenin and protein of autotetraploid were higher than that of the diploid. The protein electrophoresis bands of all the lines were similar.The experiment confirmed that the autotetraploid plant of Dioscorea zingiberensis, which was artificially induced, had good genetic stability. It lays the foundation for the polyploid breeding to develop superior varieties of Dioscorea zingiberensis.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174097","annotations":[{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.872113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Polyacrylamide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.763198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic drift","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Protein electrophoresis","weight":0.399596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Agronomy","weight":0.202265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agronomy"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.122269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Polyacrylamide gel","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide_gel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Plantlet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantlet"},{"name":"Ovary (plants)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary_(plants)"}]}
