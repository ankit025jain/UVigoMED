{"id":53285,"title":"Activation of AKT by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine induces vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Vascular calcification is a serious cardiovascular complication that contributes to the increased morbidity and mortality of patients with diabetes mellitus. Hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes mellitus, is associated with increased vascular calcification and increased modification of proteins by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation).We sought to determine the role of protein O-GlcNAcylation in regulating vascular calcification and the underlying mechanisms.Low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice exhibited increased aortic O-GlcNAcylation and vascular calcification, which was also associated with impaired aortic compliance in mice. Elevation of O-GlcNAcylation by administration of Thiamet-G, a potent inhibitor for O-GlcNAcase that removes O-GlcNAcylation, further accelerated vascular calcification and worsened aortic compliance of diabetic mice in vivo. Increased O-GlcNAcylation, either by Thiamet-G or O-GlcNAcase knockdown, promoted calcification of primary mouse vascular smooth muscle cells. Increased O-GlcNAcylation in diabetic arteries or in the O-GlcNAcase knockdown vascular smooth muscle cell upregulated expression of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 and enhanced activation of AKT. O-GlcNAcylation of AKT at two new sites, T430 and T479, promoted AKT phosphorylation, which in turn enhanced vascular smooth muscle cell calcification. Site-directed mutation of AKT at T430 and T479 decreased O-GlcNAcylation, inhibited phosphorylation of AKT at S473 and binding of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 to AKT, and subsequently blocked Runx2 transactivity and vascular smooth muscle cell calcification.O-GlcNAcylation of AKT at 2 new sites enhanced AKT phosphorylation and activation, thus promoting vascular calcification. Our studies have identified a novel causative effect of O-GlcNAcylation in regulating vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus and uncovered a key molecular mechanism underlying O-GlcNAcylation-mediated activation of AKT.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526702","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.84936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.696827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.624575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.567968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.528154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.349941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.30484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.292157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Vascular smooth muscle","weight":0.0434792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_smooth_muscle"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"RUNX2","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUNX2"}]}
