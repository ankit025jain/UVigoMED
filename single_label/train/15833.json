{"id":15833,"title":"Glycopeptide antibiotics: back to the future.","abstract":"Glycopeptide antibiotics have been a key weapon in the fight against bacterial infections for over half a century, with the progenitors, vancomycin (1) and teicoplanin (2), still used extensively. The increased occurrence of resistance and the effectiveness of these 'last resort' treatments for Gram-positive infections has led to the discovery and clinical development of second generation, semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide derivatives such as telavancin (3), dalbavancin (4) and oritavancin (5), which all possess broader spectra of activity and improved pharmacokinetic properties. Two of these new antibiotics, telavancin (3) and dalbavancin (4), were approved in the past 5 years and the third, oritavancin (5), is awaiting regulatory approval. In this review, the discovery, development and associated resistance of vancomycin (1) and teicoplanin (2), and semi-synthetic glycopeptides, telavancin (3), dalbavancin (4) and oritavancin (5), are detailed. The clinical implications of glycopeptide resistance, especially vancomycin (1), as well as the future prospects for current glycopeptide drugs and the development of new glycopeptides are discussed.
