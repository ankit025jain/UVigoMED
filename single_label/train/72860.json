{"id":72860,"title":"Overexpression of ER? is sufficient to inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transactivation.","abstract":"Estrogen receptor (ER) ? is predicted to play an important role in the prevention of breast cancer development and progression. We have previously shown that ER? suppresses hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1-mediated transcription through aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) degradation via ubiquitination processes. In this study, we attempted to examine the effect of ER? specific ligand on HIF-1 inhibition in ER? positive PC3 cells and ER? transfected MCF-7 cells. ER? specific agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) stimulated estrogen response element (ERE)-luciferase activity in a similar fashion to estradiol in PC3 cells. We observed that DPN down-regulates the ARNT protein levels leading to an attenuation of hypoxia-induced hypoxia response element (HRE)-driven luciferase reporter gene activation in PC3 cells. Treatment of DPN reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and co-treatment with ER? specific antagonist PHTPP abrogated the effect in PC3 cells. We then examined the effect of DPN in ER? transfected MCF-7 cells. HIF-1 transcriptional activity repression by ER? was not further reduced by DPN, as examined by HRE-driven luciferase assays. Expression of ER? significantly decreased VEGF secretion and ARNT expression under hypoxic conditions. However, DPN did not additionally affect this suppression in MCF-7 cells transfected with ER?. This result shows that unliganded ER? is sufficient to inhibit HIF-1 in systems of overexpression.
