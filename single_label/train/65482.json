{"id":65482,"title":"Intraoperative assessment of vascular access.","abstract":"The intraoperative quality assessment of the arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis is an essential process to limit early failure due to technical problems or inadequate vascular quality. This step is not clearly defined in the literature with no recommendations.We selected published articles related to the topic of intraoperative quality control of the vascular access for hemodialysis.The intraoperative blood flow measurement greater than 120 ml/min in autologous fistula and less than 320 ml/min in arteriovenous graft was described as predictive factors for early failure.The blood flow measurement should be performed after the confection of the anastomosis. When blood flow is limited, fistulography is an essential step to assess patency.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817447","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.679512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.613833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.511382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.277153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.182231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Flow measurement","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Confectionery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
