{"id":61689,"title":"[A case of chronic idiopathic purpura].","abstract":"This paper focuses though on the medical management of the chronic ITP, as well as on the controversies generated by it and the therapeutic progress. Even if the idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rather frequent cause of childhood thrombocytopenia, it remains an exclusion diagnosis to be considered only in cases of persistent isolated thrombocytopenia observed in previously healthy children (other etiology excluded by the physical examination and medical history). Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is secondary to the premature platelet lysis by antibodies targeting the platelet membrane glycoproteins. The chronic evolution is defined by a prolongation of symptoms for more than 12 months. The management of chronic ITP remains controversial. Novel treatments are on the spot, such as the rituximab and the thrombopoetin receptors' agonists (the most up-to-date therapies). We present the case of a 10 years old girl admitted in our department for recurrent diffuse purpuric lesions in the context of a chronic idiopathic purpura. The clinical aspects were classical: diffuse purpuric rash, without any other symptoms. An extended check-up was performed: it confirmed the presence of anti-platelets antibodies.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683840","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.547669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.528395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.526586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.472209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
