{"id":88394,"title":"Usefulness of troponin T to predict short-term and long-term mortality in patients after hip fracture.","abstract":"The purpose was to evaluate the short-term (30-day) and long-term (1,000-day) prognostic values of perioperative troponin T (TnT) and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in hip fracture patients. A consecutive cohort of 200 patients (68 men) was enrolled. Blinded TnT levels and ECG were assessed on admission, before operation, and on first and second postoperative days. Median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 3.1 (0.3) years. TnT elevation was observed in 71 patients (35.5%): already before the operation in 36 patients (51%) and only after surgery in 35 patients (49%). New ischemic ECG changes were detected in 101 of 194 patients (52%), including 7 ST elevations. Patients with TnT elevation had higher short-term (17% vs 4.7%, respectively, p=0.008) and long-term (61% vs 40%, respectively, p=0.005) mortality, the short-term mortality being higher in patients with major (TnT?0.15 ?g/L) compared with minor TnT elevation (24% vs 13%, respectively, p=0.005). TnT elevation was the only independent predictor of short-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 10.3, p=0.007), whereas TnT elevation (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.64, p=0.01), increasing age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06, p=0.01), dementia (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.78, p=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.93, p=0.007) remained independent predictors of long-term mortality. ECG findings other than ST elevation did not affect mortality. In conclusion, elevated perioperative TnT level is a strong predictor of short-term and long-term mortality. Routine TnT measurements and earlier diagnosis together with appropriate treatment may improve survival of this fragile patient group.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856320","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.781217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.760836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.529774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.40565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.356203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.307319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.224371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.204292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Troponin T","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_T"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"ST elevation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST_elevation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"}]}
