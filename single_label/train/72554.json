{"id":72554,"title":"Phase 1 evaluation of EZN-2208, a polyethylene glycol conjugate of SN38, in children adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.","abstract":"EZN-2208 is a water-soluble PEGylated conjugate of the topoisomerase inhibitor SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Compared to irinotecan, EZN-2208 has a prolonged half-life permitting extended exposure to SN38. EZN-2208 has demonstrated clinical tolerability and antitumor activity in adults with advanced solid tumors. This Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of EZN-2208 in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.EZN-2208 was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once every 21 days at five dose levels (12-30?mg/m(2) ). Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim was administered 24-48?hours after treatment with EZN-2208. The rolling-six design was used for dose determination.Thirty eligible patients (15 females; median [range] age 11.5 years [2-21 years]) were treated with EZN-2208. Dose-limiting diarrhea occurred in one patient receiving 16?mg/m(2) and dose-limiting dehydration was seen in one patient receiving 24?mg/m(2) . At dose levels above 16?mg/m(2) , Grade ?3 myelosuppression was demonstrated in the majority of patients. Additional adverse events included nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. The maximum tolerated dose was identified as 24?mg/m(2) due to dose-limiting thrombocytopenia in two patients receiving 30?mg/m(2) . Two of nine patients with neuroblastoma who were evaluable for response had partial responses. Five patients (four with neuroblastoma) remained on study for ?8 cycles.EZN-2208 was generally well-tolerated and was associated with clinical benefit in patients with neuroblastoma.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962521","annotations":[{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.953895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Bone marrow suppression","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Dehydration","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"},{"name":"Topoisomerase","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Filgrastim","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filgrastim"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.731111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Topoisomerase inhibitor","weight":0.686284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.639933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pegfilgrastim","weight":0.297643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegfilgrastim"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.122719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Active metabolite","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_metabolite"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
