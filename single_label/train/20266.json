{"id":20266,"title":"Interferon-gamma as adjunctive immunotherapy for invasive fungal infections: a case series.","abstract":"Invasive fungal infections are very severe infections associated with high mortality rates, despite the availability of new classes of antifungal agents. Based on pathophysiological mechanisms and limited pre-clinical and clinical data, adjunctive immune-stimulatory therapy with interferon-gamma (IFN-?) may represent a promising candidate to improve outcome of invasive fungal infections by enhancing host defence mechanisms.In this open-label, prospective case series, we describe eight patients with invasive Candida and/or Aspergillus infections who were treated with recombinant IFN-? (rIFN-?, 100 ?g s.c., thrice a week) for 2 weeks in addition to standard antifungal therapy.Recombinant IFN-? treatment in patients with invasive Candida and/or Aspergillus infections partially restored immune function, as characterized by an increased HLA-DR expression in those patients with a baseline expression below 50%, and an enhanced capacity of leukocytes from treated patients to produce proinflammatory cytokines involved in antifungal defence.The present study provides evidence that adjunctive immunotherapy with IFN-? can restore immune function in fungal sepsis patients, warranting future clinical studies to assess its potential clinical benefit.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669841","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.809037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.804993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.573775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.543214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Aspergillus","weight":0.477504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.352099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Defence mechanism","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
