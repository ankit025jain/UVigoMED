{"id":36603,"title":"US Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board 2013 recommendations for the management of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency.","abstract":"The treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has undergone dramatic changes as newer medicines have become available in recent years. Optimal care of these patients requires a comprehensive management plan. Although several consensus papers have been published concerning the diagnosis and treatment of HAE, guidelines for a comprehensive management plan have not been developed.To develop state-of-the-art recommendations for the treatment and management of HAE due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency in the United States.Members of the US Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board began by reviewing the literature concerning treatment of HAE. Preliminary recommendations were developed based on the literature review, discussions in a face-to-face meeting, and refinements in a series of drafts. Final recommendations reflect the unanimous consensus of the medical advisory board and the US Hereditary Angioedema Association leadership.Recommendations are provided regarding a comprehensive care plan for HAE, including the following: development of an overall management plan, treatment of angioedema attacks, prophylactic treatment, and patient monitoring.A comprehensive individualized management plan developed between an expert HAE physician and the patient, in collaboration with local medical providers and emergency departments, can provide patients with the best opportunity to lead a normal life.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565617","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.548517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.351631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Angioedema","weight":0.287801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.282766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.264124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0633417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Leadership","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership"},{"name":"Medical monitor","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_monitor"},{"name":"C1-inhibitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1-inhibitor"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Advisory board","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_board"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Isoniazid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Unanimity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimity"},{"name":"College Football All-America Team","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team"}]}
