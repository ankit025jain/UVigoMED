{"id":64695,"title":"Assessment of ischemia-modified albumin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","abstract":"Oxygen metabolism has an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Abundant amounts of ROS have been identified in the synovial fluid of RA patients. The accumulation of ROS in cells also serves as an important intracellular signaling of molecules that amplify the synovial inflammatory-proliferative response. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the IMA levels and other oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in RA subjects.IMA, AOPP, CRP, hemoglobin, Hct, MCV, RF, creatinine, urea levels were assessed in 16 RA subjects and 20 healthy controls.IMA levels were significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (0.495 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.433 +/- 0.02 ABSU, p = 0.038). No significant differences were observed for the other markers studied.This study demonstrated that RA is related to oxidative stress and inflammation. We also showed for the first time an increase of IMA levels in RA subjects, suggesting that this pathology promotes an increase in the oxidative stress process.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016715","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.657805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.639504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.614257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.541312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Synovial fluid","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.153002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.0499462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
