{"id":62322,"title":"Nutritional disparities among women in urban India.","abstract":"The paper presents a wealth quartile analysis of the urban subset of the third round of Demographic Health Survey of India to unmask intra-urban nutrition disparities in women. Maternal thinness and moderate/ severe anaemia among women of the poorest urban quartile was 38.5% and 20% respectively and 1.5-1.8 times higher than the rest of urban population. Receipt of pre- and postnatal nutrition and health education and compliance to iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy was low across all quartiles. One-fourth (24.5%) of households in the lowest urban quartile consumed salt with no iodine content, which was 2.8 times higher than rest of the urban population (8.7%). The study highlights the need to use poor-specific urban data for planning and suggests (i) routine field assessment of maternal nutritional status in outreach programmes, (ii) improving access to food subsidies, subsidized adequately-iodized salt and food supplementation programmes, (iii) identifying alternative iron supplementation methods, and (iv) institutionalizing counselling days.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592595","annotations":[{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.75749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Food security","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.738424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.725578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.616108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"India","weight":0.568666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.498387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.295799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Subsidy","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Wiktionary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Involuntary commitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"},{"name":"Outreach","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreach"}]}
