{"id":40727,"title":"Endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation for treatment of large bile duct stones does not increase the risk of post-procedure pancreatitis.","abstract":"Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) and endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation (EPLBD) are well-known procedures for the treatment of common duct stones. There was no statistically significant difference in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis rates between ES and EPLBD in most studies. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether EPLBD increases the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis and to identify the risk factors influencing post-ERCP pancreatitis.A review of 341 patients who underwent ERCP for treatment of common duct stones larger than 1 cm in diameter from January 2006 to December 2011 was conducted retrospectively. Patients were divided into three groups: ES group (n = 207), EPLBD + ES group (n = 99), and EPLBD with previous history of ES group (n = 35).Of 341 patients, overall incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 2.6% (n = 9). Incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 3.4, 2.0, and 0% in the ES group, EPLBD + ES group, and EPLBD with previous history of ES group, respectively. No significant difference in the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was observed among the three groups (p = 0.47). Endoscopic biliary stenting was the independent risk factor for pancreatitis according to univariate (p = 0.046) and multivariate analyses (p = 0.036, OR 4.211, 95% CI 1.095-16.199). Age, sex, stone size, mechanical lithotripsy, common bile duct diameter, balloon size, and duration of balloon dilation were not significantly related to post-ERCP pancreatitis.EPLBD with antecedent limited ES or previous ES state does not increase the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients with large bile duct stones. Endoscopic biliary stenting seems to be the independent risk factor of post-ERCP pancreatitis.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996378","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.833135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.737234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.626043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.60652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.50326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.410411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.402043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_shock_wave_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
