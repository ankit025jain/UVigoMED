{"id":54500,"title":"Hyperstimulation syndrome: the levels of inhibin A and B in sera and follicular fluids.","abstract":"Ovarial hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) represents a serious problem encountered during in vitro fertilization (IVF). We examined 10 patients with OHSS and 50 women also hormonally stimulated in the process of IVF who had no complications. In all women, we evaluated the number of obtained oocytes and the level of inhibins A and B in sera and follicular fluid collected at the time of ovarial puncture, the day embryo transfer and on the day of positivity for hCG. The level of inhibin B in both fluids was significantly higher (t?=?0.0403) in women with high quality of oocytes. The higher level of inhibin A was detected in patients with OHSS at the time of oocyte collection and on the day of embryo transfer. Inhibin B was elevated only at the time of oocyte collection. The levels of inhibin A and B were identical in follicular fluids collected from both ovaries. We observed no statistically significant differences between the levels of inhibin A and B in follicular fluids of women in the absence of OHSS. Evaluation of serum levels of inhibin A and B at the time of oocyte collection may contribute to the prognosis and prevention of OHSS.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455972","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.786959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.549875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Embryo transfer","weight":0.381108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer"},{"name":"Follicular fluid","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_fluid"},{"name":"Activin and inhibin","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activin_and_inhibin"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","weight":0.265768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.040567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"}]}
