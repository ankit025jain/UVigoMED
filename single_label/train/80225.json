{"id":80225,"title":"[Pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in the body lice Pediculus humanus humanus L.: detoxification enzyme systems].","abstract":"Synergists (piperonyl butoxide, MGK-264 (N-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide), DEF (S, S, S, tributyl phosphorotrithioate), and diethylmaleate) were used to investigate the metabolic resistance of body lice to permethrin. Instances of the synergistic activity ofpermethrin when combined with enzyme system inhibitors have been identified. The synergic ratios were 3.3 to 52.0 for monooxygenase inhibitors; 5.2 to 7.4 for esterases, and about 4 for glutathione-S-transferases. Since the use of the synergists did not lead to full inhibition of resistance, it was concluded that the lice had also a kdr-like type of resistance.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738222","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Piperonyl butoxide","weight":0.753221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperonyl_butoxide"},{"name":"Pyrethroid","weight":0.752383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethroid"},{"name":"Permethrin","weight":0.272222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permethrin"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Louse","weight":0.07199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse"},{"name":"Sucking louse","weight":0.0540607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucking_louse"},{"name":"Body louse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_louse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"Design Exchange Format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Exchange_Format"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Synergist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergist"},{"name":"National Security Council (Turkey)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council_(Turkey)"},{"name":"Monooxygenase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monooxygenase"},{"name":"Pesticide resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_resistance"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Esterase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterase"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"}]}
