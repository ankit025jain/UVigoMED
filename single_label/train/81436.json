{"id":81436,"title":"[The condition of the system \"peroxide oxidation of lipids-antioxidant defense\" in mixed saliva of patients with chronic generalized periodontitis].","abstract":"The comparative analysis was made concerning conditions of the system \"Peroxide oxidation of lipids-antioxidant defenses in mixed saliva of patients with chronic disseminated periodontitis of light (n = 45), mean (n = 36) and severe (n = 18) degrees. The control group consisted of 25 clinically healthy persons with intact periodontium. The study revealed that in comparison with control group, in patients with chronic disseminated periodontitis occurred an increasing of content of heptane-soluble diene conjugates, isopropanol-soluble ketodienes and conjugated trienes, ceruloplasmin and a decreasing of level of alpha-tocopherol, especially under severe degree of disease. The study also established a non-linear U-dependence between indicators of the system \"Peroxide oxidation of lipids-antioxidant defenses\" in mixed saliva and severity of affection of tissues of periodontium in patients with chronic disseminated dermatosis.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069233","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.543828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Diene","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diene"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Polyene","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyene"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"}]}
