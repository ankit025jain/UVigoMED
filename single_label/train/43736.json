{"id":43736,"title":"Suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and hepatitis B surface antigen secretion with interferon-?1 or PEG-interferon-?1.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Conventional interferon-? (IFN-?) and pegylated IFNs (PEG-IFNs) approved for chronic HBV infection treatment can reduce the risk of HCC but are not suitable for the majority of patients and cause significant side effects. IFN-?1 is a type III IFN with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory functions similar to type I IFNs but with fewer side effects. However, the tolerability and antitumor activity of PEG-IFN-?1 in HCC xenograft mice are unknown. In vitro IFN-?1 treatment of Hep3B and Huh7 human hepatoma cell lines increased MHC class I expression, activated JAK-STAT signaling pathways, induced IFN-stimulated gene expression, and inhibited hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression. IFN-?1 treatment also caused 23.2 and 19.9% growth inhibition of Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively, and promoted cellular apoptosis. PEG-IFN-?1, but not IFN-?1 treatment, significantly suppressed tumor growth (P=0.002) and induced tumor cell apoptosis in a Hep3B cell xenograft mouse model without significant weight loss or toxicity. PEG-IFN-?1 also significantly inhibited (P=0.000) serum HBsAg secretion from Hep3B xenograft tumors in vivo. Thus, PEG-IFN-?1 can suppress Hep3B xenograft tumor growth and inhibit HBsAg production and may be a potential treatment for HBV-related HCC.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Digestive System
