{"id":14044,"title":"Chronic unpredictable mild stress impairs erythrocyte immune function and changes T-lymphocyte subsets in a rat model of stress-induced depression.","abstract":"Stress has been shown to suppress immune function and increase susceptibility to inflammatory and psychiatric diseases. This study sought to investigate the changes in erythrocyte immune functions and T-lymphocyte subsets and to explore the mechanism implicated in the process of stress-induced depression by employing a rat depression model induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The body weights and behavioral changes of the rats were recorded, and plasma corticosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Erythrocyte immune function and T-lymphocytes subsets were respectively measured by the method of yeast rosette and flow cytometry at different time intervals, and their relationship was analyzed. Results indicated that a reduction was observed in the following: the rats' crossing and rearing movement times, the volume of sucrose intake and the preference for sucrose in the depression model group. Plasma corticosterone levels were elevated; the rate of E-C3bR decreased, and E-IC was increased. Some alterations in the percentage of T-lymphocytes and IL-2 appeared in the depression model group and some relationships existed between these parameters. Collectively, these findings disclose that long-time stress could induce changes in rat behavior and activities through an effect on erythrocyte immune functions and T-lymphocyte subsets.
