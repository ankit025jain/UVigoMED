{"id":86461,"title":"(18)F-FDG uptake predicts diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsy in peripheral lung cancer.","abstract":"Recent advances in endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath (EBUS-GS) have enabled better visualization of distal airways, while virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) has been shown useful as a guide to navigate the bronchoscope. However, indications for utilizing VBN and EBUS-GS are not always clear. To clarify indications for a bronchoscopic examination using VBN and EBUS-GS, we evaluated factors that predict the diagnostic yield of a transbronchial biopsy (TBB) procedure for peripheral lung cancer (PLC) lesions.We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 194 patients with 201 PLC lesions (?3cm mean diameter), and analyzed the association of diagnostic yield of TBB with [(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography and chest computed tomography (CT) findings.The diagnostic yield of TBB using VBN and EBUS-GS was 66.7%. High maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), positive bronchus sign, and ground-glass opacity component shown on CT were all significant predictors of diagnostic yield, while multivariate analysis showed only high (18)F-FDG uptake (SUVmax ?2.8) and positive bronchus sign as significant predictors. Diagnostic yield was higher for PLC lesions with high (18)F-FDG uptake (SUVmax ?2.8) and positive bronchus sign (84.6%) than for those with SUVmax <2.8 and negative bronchus sign (33.3%). High (18)F-FDG uptake was also correlated with tumor invasiveness.High (18)F-FDG uptake predicted the diagnostic yield of TBB using VBN and EBUS-GS for PLC lesions. (18)F-FDG uptake and bronchus sign may indicate for the accurate application of bronchoscopy with those modalities for diagnosing PLC.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24775095","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Bronchus","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.615388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.597403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.574321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.478927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.456946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0540107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
