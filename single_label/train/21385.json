{"id":21385,"title":"[Improvement of typification of natural foci of plague based on ecological-genetic analysis of Yersinia pestis].","abstract":"Contemporary features of distribution of various subspecies and biovars of plague causative agent by landscape-geographical zones and mountain belts on the territory of Russia and other CIS countries are examined. The most widely spread in plain and mountain natural foci were noted to be Yersinia pestis main subspecies medieval biovar strains. Strains of Y. pestis non-main subspecies are spread in mountain landscapes of Altai, Caucasus, Tian Shan. Change of dominating species of rodents considered as the main carriers of plague was noted not to result in change of genetic and biochemical characteristics of Y. pestis strains. Perspectives of study of \"micro-focality\" of plague are emphasized for deciphering the mechanism of the enzootic.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605665","annotations":[{"name":"Caucasus","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.838973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Tian Shan","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Shan"},{"name":"Subspecies","weight":0.669027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"},{"name":"Middle Ages","weight":0.573169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.560592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.392249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.283077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Commonwealth of Independent States","weight":0.180731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Enzootic","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzootic"},{"name":"Altai Mountains","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Mountains"},{"name":"Bubonic plague","weight":0.122801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague"},{"name":"Plain","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"},{"name":"Yersinia pestis","weight":0.0894229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Landscape","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cryptanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Geology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Shan people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_people"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Tian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian"},{"name":"Causative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Yersinia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Biovar","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biovar"}]}
