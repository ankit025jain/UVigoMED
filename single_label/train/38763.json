{"id":38763,"title":"Cartilage-hair hypoplasia: follow-up of immunodeficiency in two patients.","abstract":"To study the changes in the immunological status in 2 children with cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH).A 4-6 year immunological follow-up from infancy.In infancy the children presented a combined T cell and B cell immunodeficiency which partly resolved in time. Mitogen-induced T cell proliferation values fluctuated but lymphopenia has remained constant. Both patients had no recent thymic emigrants (TREC). Both children have suffered from a prolonged viral infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia normalized during the first years of life but both children have a specific antibody deficiency (SAD).The changes in the immunological status in CHH patients emphasize the importance of a regular follow-up. SAD should be searched for in CHH. The absence of TRECs supports combined immunodeficiency and possible need of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402619","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.836512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Lymphocytopenia","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytopenia"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Hypogammaglobulinemia","weight":0.668171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogammaglobulinemia"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.585377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.571318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Combined immunodeficiencies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_immunodeficiencies"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Emigration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration"}]}
