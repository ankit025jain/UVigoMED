{"id":91407,"title":"Electrospun antibacterial polyurethane-cellulose acetate-zein composite mats for wound dressing.","abstract":"In this study, an antibacterial electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds with diameters around 400-700 nm were prepared by physically blending polyurethane (PU) with two biopolymers such as cellulose acetate (CA) and zein. Here, PU was used as the foundation polymer, was blended with CA and zein to achieve desirable properties such as better hydrophilicity, excellent cell attachment, proliferation and blood clotting ability. To prevent common clinical infections, an antimicrobial agent, streptomycin sulfate was incorporated into the electrospun fibers and its antimicrobial ability against the gram negative and gram positive bacteria were examined. The interaction between fibroblasts and the PU-CA and PU-CA-zein-drug scaffolds such as viability, proliferation, and attachment were characterized. PU-CA-zein-drug composite nanoscaffold showed enhanced blood clotting ability in comparison with pristine PU nanofibers. The presence of CA and zein in the nanofiber membrane improved its hydrophilicity, bioactivity and created a moist environment for the wound, which can accelerate wound recovery.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507360","annotations":[{"name":"Gram-negative bacteria","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Hydrophile","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"},{"name":"Cellulose","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Gram-positive bacteria","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Polyurethane","weight":0.655004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.615888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Biopolymer","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolymer"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.612069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.461715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.454215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.408618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.363787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.361706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Streptomycin","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.29349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Zein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zein"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Cellulose acetate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose_acetate"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Carbon nanofiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanofiber"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
