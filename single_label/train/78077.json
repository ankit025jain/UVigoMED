{"id":78077,"title":"Dizziness: if not vertigo could it be cardiac disease?","abstract":"Dizziness is a common presentation in general practice. However, the symptom of dizziness represents a spectrum of pathology from benign to serious.This review provides an evaluation of a patient presenting with presyncope/syncope.Dizziness can be a symptom of one of four conditions: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium or light-headedness. It is often unclear what patients mean by dizziness as they use this term loosely. Hence, clinicians must be vigilant in evaluating patients presenting with dizziness and be mindful of red flags that may indicate serious pathology. This review begins with a case study describing the wide range of causes of dizziness. Careful history taking and physical examination are pivotal in evaluating patients presenting with dizziness.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791765","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.454452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.386252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.276152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Lightheadedness","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightheadedness"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Presyncope","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presyncope"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mindfulness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
