{"id":86400,"title":"[Venous thromboembolic complications in patients with intracranial hemorrhage and tumors of the central nervous system].","abstract":"It was analyzed the results of diagnosis and prevention of venous thromboembolic complications in 248 patients with intracranial hemorrhages of different etiology (hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, craniocerebral injury, hemorrhages in the tumors of brain and spinal cord). The overall frequency of venous thrombosis in the vessels of the inferior vena cava pool was 24.6% (in 61 patients), the majority of patients had the asymptomatic thrombosis. The crural veins were the main localization of venous thrombosis. Also it was the main origin of thromboembolic complications (60.7%). Surgical treatment in different amount was an independent predictor of venous thromboembolic complications in neurosurgical patients according to the multivariate variance analysis. The frequency of thrombosis was significantly higher in the group of operated patients in comparison with non-operated group (37.1 vs. 17.6% (p=0.008). Early prevention by geparin (the use of direct anticoagulants for 2-4-th day of the founding of an intracranial hematoma) did not reduce the frequency of venous thrombosis in operated patients, but significantly reduced the frequency of fatal pulmonary embolism: 0 vs. 9.1% (p=0.002). Patients with intracranial hemorrhage are the one of the most unfavorable groups in terms of their venous thromboembolic complications.
