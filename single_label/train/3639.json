{"id":3639,"title":"Sonographic evaluation of palpable superficial masses.","abstract":"Palpable soft tissue masses are common and are often referred for imaging evaluation. Ultrasonography is an attractive way to image these lesions because it is inexpensive, readily available, and does not rely on ionizing radiation. Ultrasonography can easily confirm the presence of a mass, differentiate solid from cystic lesions, define the anatomic extent of the lesion, and detect vascular lesions with high sensitivity. In most cases, ultrasonography can accurately characterize the lesion, obviating biopsy and reducing unnecessary further work-up. This article reviews the capabilities of ultrasonography in evaluating superficial soft tissue lesions and the sonographic appearance of disease entities.
