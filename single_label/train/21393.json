{"id":21393,"title":"[The treatment of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections].","abstract":"Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) and influenza take a leading place in the structure of the general morbidity of the population in most countries of the world. Of etiotropic treatment of influenza and other ARVI include a wide spectrum of antiviral drugs, among which are the drugs with a restricted spectrum, basically used in influenza, and a general spectrum used in influenza and other ARVI as a prophylactic or therapeutic intention. At present time, there is a widespread antiviral drug umifenovir. On the mechanism of antiviral action it refers to the fusion inhibitors of the virus with the cell membrane. Antiviral activity in vitro umifenovir studied in several independent laboratories. Umifenovir active against respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, including the causative agent of atypical pneumonia. There are a large number of studies that have shown clinical efficiency of umifenovir. In clinical studies of prophylactic and therapeutic efficiency of umifenovir attended by 12400 and 1400 persons relatively. An important role in the prevention and treatment of influenza and ARVI occupy modern nanotechnological products of natural origin such as anaferon, aflubin, oscillococcinum having antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, disintoxicational and antipyretic activity.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605619","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Atypical pneumonia","weight":0.882475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_pneumonia"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Antipyretic","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Human respiratory syncytial virus","weight":0.828081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Human parainfluenza viruses","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_parainfluenza_viruses"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Syncytium","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.542751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.484509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.343394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.262099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.141499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Entry inhibitor","weight":0.0853846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
