{"id":83778,"title":"[Clinico-morphological substantiation of feasibility of angiosomic adipose-cutaneous flaps from temporal and parietal regions application].","abstract":"Actuality of the problem, consisting of restoration of defects and deformity zones on head and neck, is caused by great quantity of patients, surgical treatment of which constitute important medico-social problem. The flaps, raised from temporal and parietal regions, are considered perspective for replacement of defects and the deformity zones on head and neck. But, for their correct isolation and mobilization it is necessary to know the topographoanatomical peculiarities of superficial temporal artery, localization of which differs, depending on the head form. The methods of isolation and mobilization of angiosomic preauricular, postauricular and fascial temporal-parietal flaps were optimized in the clinic, basing on analysis of results of the investigations performed and computeric modeling of the superficial temporal artery branches.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252557","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.737663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.312741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.271842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Superficial temporal artery","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficial_temporal_artery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Potentiality and actuality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality"},{"name":"Head and neck anatomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_anatomy"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
