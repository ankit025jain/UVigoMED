{"id":85331,"title":"High altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) in an Indian pilgrim.","abstract":"Increasing number of Hindu pilgrims visit the Himalayas where some of them suffer from high altitude illness including the life threatening forms, high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral oedema. Compared to tourists and trekkers, pilgrims are usually ignorant about altitude illness. This is a case of a pilgrim who suffered from HAPE on his trip to Kailash-Mansarovar and is brought to a tertiary level hospital in Kathmandu. This report emphasises on how to treat a patient with HAPE, a disease which is increasingly being seen in the high altitude pilgrim population.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974506","annotations":[{"name":"Himalayas","weight":0.554949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.424541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Kathmandu","weight":0.39672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Hindu","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu"},{"name":"Pilgrim","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim"},{"name":"High altitude cerebral edema","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude_cerebral_edema"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.170862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"High altitude pulmonary edema","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude_pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Cerebral edema","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"High altitude","weight":0.0174429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Hiking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"}]}
