{"id":11138,"title":"Effect of topical epigallocatechin gallate on corneal neovascularization in rabbits.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical application of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for the treatment of corneal neovascularization in a rabbit model.Corneal neovascularization was induced in 12 rabbits by placing a black silk suture in the corneal stroma (24 eyes) for a week. After suturing, 1 randomly chosen eye of the 12 rabbits was treated with topical EGCG at 2 different concentrations: 0.01% (group 1) and 0.1% (group 2), whereas the contralateral eyes were treated with sterilized balanced salt solution as the control. All eye drops were applied for 2 weeks after suturing. The suture materials were removed from all eyes on day 7. The surface area of corneal neovascularization was measured and analyzed in all eyes on days 7 and 14. On day 14, all eyes were extracted to measure the concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) messenger RNA and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein.The surface area of induced corneal neovascularization was significantly smaller only in group 2 compared with that of the control group on days 7 and 14 (P < 0.001). The change in surface area of corneal neovascularization after removal of the suture material was not significantly different between all 3 groups. VEGF messenger RNA levels were significantly lower in group 2 than in the control group (P < 0.001). The concentration of COX-2 was significantly lower in group 2 than in the control group (P = 0.043), but no significant difference was observed between group 1 and the control group.Topical administration of EGCG effectively inhibits corneal neovascularization in rabbits. This inhibitory effect is probably related to the suppression of VEGF and COX-2 meditated angiogenesis.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608256","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.898537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.816363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.786694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.712613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.575529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.370339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Silk","weight":0.347254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.320694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.226491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.190433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.181725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.121905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0678226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Corneal neovascularization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Epigallocatechin gallate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigallocatechin_gallate"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Meditation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
