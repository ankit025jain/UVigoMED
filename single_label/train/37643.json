{"id":37643,"title":"Pulmonary medication adherence and health-care use in cystic fibrosis.","abstract":"Poor treatment adherence is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and may lead to worse health outcomes and greater health-care use. This study evaluated associations of adherence to pulmonary medications, age, health-care use, and cost among patients with CF.Patients with CF aged ? 6 years were identified in a national commercial claims database. A 12-month medication possession ratio (MPR) was computed for each pulmonary medication and then averaged for a composite MPR (CMPR) for each patient. The CMPR was categorized as low (< 0.50), moderate (0.50-0.80), or high (? 0.80). Annual health-care use and costs were measured during the first and second year and compared across adherence categories by multivariable modeling.Mean CMPR for the sample (N = 3,287) was 48% Â± 31%. Age was inversely related to CMPR. In the concurrent year, more CF-related hospitalizations were observed among patients with low (event rate ratio [ERR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.15-1.57) and moderate (ERR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05-1.48) vs high adherence; similar associations were observed for all-cause hospitalizations and CF-related and all-cause acute care use (hospitalizations + ED) in the concurrent and subsequent year. Rates of CF-related and all-cause outpatient visits did not differ by adherence. Low and moderate adherence predicted higher concurrent health-care costs by $14,211 ($5,557-$24,371) and $8,493 (-$1,691 to $19,709), respectively, compared with high adherence.Worse adherence to pulmonary medications was associated with higher acute health-care use in a national, privately insured cohort of patients with CF. Addressing adherence may reduce avoidable health-care use.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480974","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.368049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.255664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.145929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0885189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"ERR","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERR"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 12","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_12"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"}]}
