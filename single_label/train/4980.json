{"id":4980,"title":"[Clinical effect of one-stage arthroscopically assisted repair and reconstruction for posterolateral dislocation of knee joint with multiple ligament injuries].","abstract":"To evaluate clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction under arthroscopy and repair of the injured posteromedial complex structure of the knee joint in the treatment of posterolateral knee dislocation with multiple ligament injuries.From March 2008 to August 2012,22 patients (16 males and 6 females, ranging in age from 20 to 53 years old, with an average of 30.5 years old) with posterolateral dislocation of the knee were treated with primary reconstruction of ACL and PCL, combined with the repair of injuries in the posteromedial complex and soft-tissue. Eight patients had injuries caused by sports,5 patients road accidents and 9 patients falling down. The ACL was reconstructed using the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons. The PCL was reconstructed using LARS artificial ligaments (14 cases), or gracilis and semitendinosus tendons (8 cases). Suture repair was performed in 17 patients with posteromedial ligament injuries,and self-semitendinosus strengthening operations were performed in 5 patients. Continuouspassive montion (CPM) and active exercises were executed after operation at early stage. The IKDC and Lysholm system were used to evaluate therapeutic effects.All the patients were regularly followed up, and the duration ranged from 11 to 56 months (averaged, 39 months). According to the IKDC scale,9 patients got a grade A result, 10 got a grade B result, and 3 got a grade C result. The IKDC subject score was 89.6±3.1 and the Lysholm scores was 90.7±1.8 at the latest follow-up, which were both better than those before operation.Reconstructing the ACL and PCL and repairing injured posteromedial complex of the knee followed by an active rehabilitation is an effective method to treat posterolateral knee dislocation.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464597","annotations":[{"name":"Posterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Semitendinosus muscle","weight":0.637229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitendinosus_muscle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.509903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.367066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.21264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.125189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.119326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Gracilis muscle","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracilis_muscle"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"C (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"B movie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie"},{"name":"General Certificate of Secondary Education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
