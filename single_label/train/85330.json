{"id":85330,"title":"Guidelines for diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: joint recommendations of Indian Chest Society and National College of Chest Physicians (India).","abstract":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem in India. Although several International guidelines for diagnosis and management of COPD are available, yet there are lot of gaps in recognition and management of COPD in India due to vast differences in availability and affordability of healthcare facilities across the country. The Indian Chest Society and the National College of Chest Physicians (India) have joined hands to come out with these evidence-based guidelines to help the physicians at all levels of healthcare to diagnose and manage COPD in a scientific manner. Besides the International literature, the Indian studies were specifically analysed to arrive at simple and practical recommendations. The evidence is presented under these five headings: (a) definition, epidemiology and disease burden, (b) disease assessment and diagnosis, (c) pharmacologic management of stable COPD, (d) management of acute exacerbations; and (e) non-pharmacologic and preventive measures.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974625","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.404057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.386179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"India","weight":0.348267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.32438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.247928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0700436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Coming out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"},{"name":"Indology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indology"}]}
