{"id":88499,"title":"Effects of Governor Vessel electroacupuncture on the systematic expressions of NTFs in spinal cord transected rats.","abstract":"This study evaluated the effects Governor Vessel electroacupuncture (GVEA) on the systematic regulation of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) in the spinal segments caudal (CSS) to the site of transection in rats subjected to spinal cord transection (SCT). Using RT-PCR, we amazingly found the gene expressions of NGF, IGF-1, FGF-2, CNTF, PDGF, TGF-?1, TrkA, TrkB and TrkC were downregulated following GVEA treatment. However, the number of GAP-43 and Synaptophysin profiles in the CSS in the GVEA rats showed a significant increase, compared with non-EA animals, although both the 5-HT and corticospinal fibers have no statistical differences in the CSS. Simultaneously, there was significant recovery in hindlimb locomotor and sensory functions after GVEA treatment. Therefore, these findings challenge the past view that GVEA promotes functional restoration, which is linking to the up-regulation of NTFs in rats subjected to SCT. The present findings may give some novel indication on the mechanism of acupuncture for the treatment of SCI.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836602","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.747995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.593601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"},{"name":"Nerve growth factor","weight":0.445241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Synaptophysin","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptophysin"},{"name":"Sensory neuron","weight":0.21264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_neuron"},{"name":"Corticospinal tract","weight":0.208247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticospinal_tract"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.115901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Ciliary neurotrophic factor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_neurotrophic_factor"},{"name":"Gap (clothing retailer)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_(clothing_retailer)"},{"name":"Catalina Sky Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Sky_Survey"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Platelet-derived growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor"},{"name":"Basic fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"TrkA receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrkA_receptor"},{"name":"TrkB receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrkB_receptor"},{"name":"TrkC receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrkC_receptor"},{"name":"Gap-43 protein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap-43_protein"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Hindlimb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindlimb"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
