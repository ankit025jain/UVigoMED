{"id":62641,"title":"Broken heart syndrome during myasthenic crisis.","abstract":"Myocardial pathology is rarely associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). We describe a case of newly diagnosed MG with decompensated heart failure [stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM)] that occurred during the crisis phase.Case report and review of literature.A 42-year-old woman underwent chemotherapy followed by a transsternal resection of a malignant epithelioid thymoma invading the pericardium. A month after surgical resection, she developed progressive oropharyngeal symptoms with respiratory distress requiring tracheal intubation. Cardiac evaluation on the day of admission showed a normal ejection fraction, which rapidly decreased to 15% on the second hospital day and recovered to 45% after 1 week. Review of the literature revealed 4 myasthenic patients who developed SICM in the crisis phase; all improved with treatment.SICM may occur in MG crisis, especially in the presence of malignant thymoma. All previous cases including our patient had improved myocardial function and clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534829","annotations":[{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Myasthenia gravis","weight":0.877853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasthenia_gravis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.820644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Thymoma","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymoma"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.748461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.555396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.420936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.361358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.324987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
