{"id":81668,"title":"1-stage versus 2-stage lateral sinus lift procedures: 1-year post-loading results of a multicentre randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"To compare the efficacy of 1-stage versus 2-stage lateral maxillary sinus lift procedures.Sixty partially edentulous patients requiring 1 to 3 implants and having 1 to 3 mm of residual bone height and at least 5 mm bone width below the maxillary sinus, as measured on CT scans were selected. They were randomised according to a parallel group study design into two equal arms to receive either a 1-stage lateral window sinus lift with simultaneous implant placement or a 2-stage procedure with implant placement delayed by 4 months, using a bone substitute in three different centres. Implants were submerged for 4 months, loaded with reinforced provisional prostheses, which were replaced, after 4 months, by definitive prostheses. Outcome measures, assessed by masked assessors, were: augmentation procedure failures; prosthesis failures and implant failures; complications; and marginal peri-implant bone level changes. Patients were followed up to 1 year after loading. Only data of implants placed in 1 to 3 mm of bone height were reported.Two patients dropped out from the 1-stage group and none from the 2-stage group. No sinus lift procedure failed in the 1-stage group but one failed in the 2-stage group, the difference being not statistically significant (P = 1.00). Two prostheses failed or could not be placed in the planned time in the 1-stage group and one in the 2-stage group, the difference being not statistically significant (P = 0.51). Three implants failed in three patients of the 1-stage group, versus one implant in the 2-stage group, the difference being not statistically significant (P = 0.28). Two complications occurred in the 1-stage group and one in the 2-stage group, the difference being not statistically significant (P = 0.61). One year after loading, 1-stage treated patients lost an average of -1.01 mm (SD: 0.56) of peri-implant bone and 2-stage sites about -0.93 mm (SD: 0.40). There were no statistically significant differences in bone level change between groups 1 year after loading (-0.08 mm 95%CI: -0.33 to 0.18 P = 0.56).No statistically significant differences were observed between implants placed according to 1- or 2-stage sinus lift procedures. However this study may suggest that in patients having residual bone height between 1 to 3 mm below the maxillary sinus, there might be a slightly higher risk for implant failures when performing a 1-stage lateral sinus lift procedure.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892114","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.844007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.518679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.496031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.263254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0630736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus_floor_augmentation_procedure"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0257532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Wrestling mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_mask"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Elevator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator"},{"name":"Assessor (Italy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assessor_(Italy)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"}]}
