{"id":77580,"title":"[The history and the latest trend of the occupational diseases in Japan].","abstract":"This study describes the history of the occupational diseases and the preventive measures by the laws in Japan. The first serious occupational diseases occurred in mining industry in the late 19th century because the working conditions were inferior. The mining industry ordinance was enforced in 1890 as the first law that prescribed working conditions, safety and health, and injury compensation. The most serious infection disease was tuberculosis, and the mortality was 180-260 per 100,000 during 1903-45. Since the prohibition on asbestos was late for 2006, the outbreak of asbestos-related diseases will continue until 2070. Although occupational poisonings have significantly decreased, unregulated chemicals recently caused many cases of cholangiocarcinoma among offset printing workers. Mental health disorders have been increasing in the various working places indicating stressful environment.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605515","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.921372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.655185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.621546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.51933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.450836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"History","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.303847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.260462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.1895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"Printing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.041581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Local ordinance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"1890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"}]}
