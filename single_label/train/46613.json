{"id":46613,"title":"Differentiation of gastric true leiomyoma from gastric stromal tumor based on biphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomographic findings.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to identify the computed tomographic criteria that differentiate gastric true leiomyoma from gastric stromal tumor.Computed tomographic images of gastric true leiomyoma (n = 11) and gastric stromal tumor (n=30) were reviewed. The location, contour, growth pattern, enhancement pattern, necrosis, and ulceration were analyzed. Long diameter (LD), short diameter (SD), LD/SD ratio, and enhancement degree were measured and calculated. The Fisher exact test, grouped t test, rank sum test, and receiver operating characteristic curve were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated.Cardial location, round/ovoid contour, intraluminal growth, homogeneous enhancement, absence of necrosis, less than 3.35 cm in LD and less than 2.3 cm in SD, enhancement degree of less than 12.5 Hounsfield units in the arterial phase versus less than 31.5 Hounsfield units in the portal venous phase were found to be significant variables for differentiating gastric true leiomyoma from gastric stromal tumor (P < 0.05).These 9 computed tomographic criteria are helpful to differentiate gastric true leiomyoma from gastric stromal tumor.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625607","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and
