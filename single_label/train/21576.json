{"id":21576,"title":"Recognising respiratory tract infections in children.","abstract":"Respiratory tract infections are common in children and diagnosis is usually made from the history and presenting symptoms, which can include cough, wheeze and fever, among others. Community practitioners assessing children with respiratory tract infections should always consider symptoms and associated risk factors, such as prematurity and congenital heart disease, as these children will benefit from early referral and specialist management. Community practitioners have a role to play in encouraging uptake of immunisation for children and smoking cessation in parents.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597063","annotations":[{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"}]}
