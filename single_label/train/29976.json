{"id":29976,"title":"A higher frequency of peripheral blood activated B cells in patients with non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head.","abstract":"B cells play important roles in inflammatory diseases. This study was aimed at examining the frequency of different subsets of B cells in patients with non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (NONFH).The percentages of the different subsets of circulating B cells in 28 patients with steroid-related, alcohol-related, or idiopathic NONFH and 10 healthy controls (HC) were examined by flow cytometry. The concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen (FIB), immunoglobulins, cytokines and blood erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured.In comparison with those in the HC, significantly higher percentages of CD27-, CD86+, CD95+, and CD27+CD95+CD19+ but lower CD27+CD19+ B cells were detected in the patients. The percentages of CD86+, CD95+, and CD27+CD95+CD19+ B cells in each group of the patients were significantly higher than those in the HC. The levels of serum IL-17A and IFN-? in steroid group and serum TNF-? in alcoholic group were significantly higher than those in the HC. The percentages of CD86+CD19+ B cells were positively associated with the degrees of femoral head collapse in both steroid and alcoholic groups of patients and the levels of serum TNF-? were positively associated with the degrees of femoral head collapse in the alcoholic NONFH patients.These data suggest a higher frequency of CD86+CD19+ activated B cells and elevated levels of serum TNF-? may be associated with the development of NONFH.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583150","annotations":[{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.776456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.728911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.658307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.172966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"CD86","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD86"},{"name":"CD27","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD27"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Fas receptor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_receptor"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
