{"id":7922,"title":"Simvastatin reduces leucocyte- and platelet-endothelial cell interaction in murine antigen-induced arthritis in vivo.","abstract":"The use of statins in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases is well established. Their use as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has also been investigated, with several clinical and experimental studies indicating an anti-inflammatory effect of statins for RA, but other studies showing no effect or even the opposite. The current study was designed to examine the effect of simvastatin in an in vivo murine model of arthritis using intravital microscopy.We assigned four groups (n = 7, female C57Bl6 mice), two with and two without antigen-induced arthritis (AiA), from which one of the non-AiA groups and one of the AiA groups were treated with simvastatin 40 mg/kg i.p. daily for 14 consecutive days after induction of arthritis. Platelet- and leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction was assessed by measurement of rolling and adherent fluorescence-labelled platelets and leucocytes, functional capillary density (FCD) was evaluated, and knee joint diameter was determined as a clinical parameter.In arthritic mice treated with simvastatin, a significant reduction in platelet- and leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction was observed in comparison to arthritic mice treated with vehicle. In addition, a significant reduction in FCD was seen in arthritic mice treated with simvastatin, along with a reduction in knee joint swelling of the AiA mice.Treatment of AiA mice with simvastatin showed significant reductions in platelet- and leucocyte-endothelial cell interactions, in FCD, and in the swelling of the knee joint. These results support the hypothesis of the anti-inflammatory effects of statins in the treatment of RA.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825390","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.869218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.822744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.633112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.564585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.262936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Simvastatin","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simvastatin"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
