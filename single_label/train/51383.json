{"id":51383,"title":"Risk factors for central lymph node metastasis of patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"To evaluate the risk factors of central lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.Published articles about papillary thyroid microcarcinoma were searched in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE until October 2013 to examine the risky factors of central lymph node metastasis. Software RevMan 5.0 was used for meta-analysis.Within the patients suffering papillary thyroid microcarcinoma underwent thyroidectomy plus prophylactic central lymph node dissection, tumor size, multifocality and capsular invasion have statistically relevant association with central lymph node metastasis, but no relation was observed associated with sex and age.The papillary thyroid microcarcinoma should be considered central lymph node metastasis when tumor size ?0.5 cm, multifocality and have capsular invasion.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696711","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.930425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.51033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.348654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.220852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.098008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Size zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size_zero"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"}]}
