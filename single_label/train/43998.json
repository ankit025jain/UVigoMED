{"id":43998,"title":"Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC): a distinct entity.","abstract":"Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common cancer worldwide, display a highly variable clinical course, suggesting that HCC encompasses several biologically distinct subtypes. This heterogeneity has the potential to impede both treatment decisions and prognostic predictions for patients with HCC. One distinct, albeit rare, subtype of HCC is combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC), which overall carries a poorer prognosis than HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) alone. This review discusses predominantly the histopathologic and pathogenetic intricacies of this tumor and highlights the need for an accurate diagnosis of this specific HCC subtype.
