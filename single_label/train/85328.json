{"id":85328,"title":"Factors influencing healthcare utilization among children with pneumonia in Muntinlupa City, the Philippines.","abstract":"We evaluated the factors influencing healthcare utilization among children aged < 5 years with pneumonia symptoms in Muntinlupa City, the Philippines. We interviewed 1,330 caregivers from 190 households per district in seven districts from March to April, 2009 using a standardized questionnaire to obtain information about demographic characteristics, access to healthcare facilities, and potential barriers to healthcare utilization. The mean age of the children was 32 months; 54.7% were boys. Seventy-four point three percents (n = 972) of caregivers stated when their child had pneumonia symptoms they brought them to a government health center, 14.1% (n = 184) went to a private clinic, 8.0% (n = 104) went to a hospital, 3% (n = 40) were treated at home and 0.5% (n = 7) received traditional medicine from a local healer. Caregivers required an average of 12 minutes to reach a healthcare facility. Reasons given by caregivers for their choice of healthcare facility were low cost (47.5%), availability and accessibility to transportation (29.6%) and perceived good quality of care (16.5%). In conclusion, nearly three quarters of caregivers interviewed brought their child with pneumonia symptoms to a government health center for treatment. Cost was the main factor influencing choice, followed by transportation availability and quality of care.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974657","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Traditional medicine","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Philippines","weight":0.331403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.270745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.270298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Muntinlupa","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntinlupa"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/972"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
