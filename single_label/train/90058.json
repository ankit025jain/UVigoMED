{"id":90058,"title":"Study of insomnia and associated factors in traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"This study is designed to investigate prevalence and risk factors of insomnia in TBI. This study has also tried to explore the connection between insomnia with neuroanatomical localization of TBI as well as depression.Prospective study.All eligible participants were evaluated initially after two week interval for first 4 weeks and monthly interval subsequently till one year. Demographic and injury characteristics of the participants were assessed on a self-designed semi structured performa. Interviews focused on assessment of severity of TBI, insomnia and depression using GCS, ISI and PHQ-9 respectively.Total 204 patients were included, mean age was 33.34 years. 40.2% participants were found to have insomnia. None of the demographic variables were associated with insomnia except severity and duration of TBI. Moderate TBI patient (70.73%) had significantly higher occurrence of insomnia than the mild cases (19.67%) (P=0.000, df 1). First three month after TBI witnessed more than half (63.41%) of those patient who had insomnia. This was found statistically significant (P<0.017). Neuroanatomical localization was also correlated with insomnia. Cerebral contusion was the most common (40.24%) site of impact. Almost half (42.42%) of the patients with insomnia had multiple contusions. 32.84% of the study population had depression. No significant correlation could be established between depression and insomnia.Insomnia is a prevalent condition after TBI requiring more clinical and scientific attention as it may have important repercussions on rehabilitation.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655637","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.844987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Neuroanatomy","weight":0.653954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.251389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.21565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.176854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cerebral contusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_contusion"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Inter-Services Intelligence","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Df (Unix)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Df_(Unix)"}]}
