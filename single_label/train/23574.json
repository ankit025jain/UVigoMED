{"id":23574,"title":"Micafungin as antifungal prophylaxis in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: results of different dosage levels in clinical practice.","abstract":"Micafungin has been approved for the prophylaxis of Candida infections in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Here, we report a single-center experience of three different dose levels regarding efficacy, toxicity, and colonization with Candida ssp. in clinical practice. In total, 150 consecutive adult patients who underwent allo-HSCT received micafungin at a dosage of 50, 100, or 150 mg once daily for primary antifungal prophylaxis. Of those patients receiving more than six d of micafungin prophylaxis, 12/46 (26%), 6/44 (14%), and 9/46 (20%) were switched to empiric antifungal treatment. The frequency of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) according to EORTC criteria did not differ significantly (7/46; 15% vs. 5/44; 11% vs. 5/46; 11%) across the different dosage groups. In the 50-mg group, there was one case of candidemia with C. parapsilosis after 12 d of micafungin prophylaxis. In all three groups, micafungin prophylaxis was well tolerated without any case of toxicity-related treatment discontinuation. Renal function was not significantly altered, while increase of bilirubin was mainly due to concomitant ATG application. The incidence of IFIs is similar irrespective of the micafungin dosage while there was a trend toward more frequent change to empiric antifungal treatment as well as oropharyngeal colonization with candida in the lowest dosage group.
