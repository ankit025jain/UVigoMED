{"id":91659,"title":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a traffic accident: de novo aneurysm ruptured 30 years after surgical neck clipping.","abstract":"A man, who had a medical history of surgical neck clipping 30 years previously, died of traffic accident. The medico-legal autopsy showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and ruptured aneurysm on the lateral side of the clip. Microscopic examination showed the aneurysm was not to be regeneration, but a new de novo aneurysm. We diagnosed the cause of death was traumatic aneurysmal rupture. In addition, we discussed the cause of a newly formed de novo aneurysm which may be affected by past surgical neck clipping.
