{"id":62704,"title":"Prophylactic first-line antibiotics reduce infectious fever and shorten hospital stay during chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis in childhood acute myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"There exists few pediatric data on the safety and efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics during chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis.We prospectively studied the incidence of infection-related fever in 38 children, aged 2-16 years, with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over 121 chemotherapy treatment cycles. A prophylactic group (n = 18) was given either vancomycin/cefepime (400 mg/m(2), q12 h/50 mg/kg, q12 h) or piperacillin/tazobactam (110 mg/kg, q12 h). Control patients (n = 20) received no preventive antibiotics.The prophylactic group (59 treatment cycles) experienced fever less frequently than the control group (0.4 vs. 0.9 events; p < 0.001), had a longer interval between agranulocytosis and fever (6.4 vs. 3.8 days; p = 0.007), had a shorter duration of hospitalization (21.5 vs. 28.5 days; p < 0.001), and had a lower rate of lung infection (38.8 vs. 80.0%; p < 0.001). One patient taking vancomycin experienced a skin rash and 3 patients taking piperacillin/tazobactam had diarrhea; these side effects subsided after antibiotics were discontinued.In children with AML, prophylactic antibiotics during the period of chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis can effectively reduce the incidence of infectious fever and can shorten the average length of hospital stay, improving treatment success and quality of life.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525963","annotations":[{"name":"Agranulocytosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agranulocytosis"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.777552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.704136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.699044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.453533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
