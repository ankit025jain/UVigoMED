{"id":84091,"title":"[Etiological and molecular characteristics of diarrhea caused Proteus mirabilis].","abstract":"To analyze the etiological characteristics, virulence genes and plasmids that carrying diarrhea-causing Proteus mirabilis and to assess their relationship with drug resistance and pathogenicity.Proteus mirabilis coming from six different sources (food poisoning, external environment and healthy people) were analyzed biochemically, on related susceptibility and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Virulence genes were detected by PCR. Plasmids were extracted and sequenced after gel electrophoresis purification.The biochemical characteristics of Proteus mirabilis from different sources seemed basically the same, and each of them showed having common virulence genes, as ureC, rsmA, hpmA and zapA. However, the PFGE patterns and susceptibility of these strains were different, so as the plasmids that they carried. Plasmid that presented in the sequenced strain showed that the 2 683 bp length plasmid encodes qnrD gene was associated with the quinolone resistance.Etiological characteristics and molecular characteristics of Proteus mirabilis gathered from different sources, were analyzed. Results indicated that traditional biochemical analysis and common virulence gene identification might be able to distinguish the strains with different sources. However, PFGE and plasmids analysis could distinguish the sources of strains and to identify those plasmids that commonly carried by the drug-resistant strains. These findings also provided theoretical basis for further study on the nature of resistance and pathogenicity in Proteus mirabilis.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174481","annotations":[{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.84711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.809629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.772276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.737922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.665677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.589585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.43624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.390019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.30541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Proteus mirabilis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_mirabilis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"}]}
