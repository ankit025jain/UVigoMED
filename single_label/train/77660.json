{"id":77660,"title":"Managing work-related stress in the district nursing workplace.","abstract":"This article aims to highlight the issue of work-related stress within the district nursing workplace. It will acknowledge how the management of work-related stress has previously been discussed within nursing literature and will consider the emerging relationship between staff working conditions, staff wellbeing and quality of patient care. It will reintroduce the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Management Standards approach to tackling work-related stress, which provides management support to reduce environmental work stressors and encourage enabling work environments and a positive workplace culture.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471225","annotations":[{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.766594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.610653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.482442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Health and Safety Executive","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Safety_Executive"},{"name":"District nurse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_nurse"},{"name":"Tackle (football move)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Reintroduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reintroduction"},{"name":"Environmental impact statement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_statement"}]}
