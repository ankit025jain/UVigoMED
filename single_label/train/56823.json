{"id":56823,"title":"[Hypotensive efficacy of combined pathogenically oriented surgical treatment of cataract and primary open-angle glaucoma].","abstract":"A new algorithm of combined surgical treatment of cataract and glaucoma was developed. It enables selection of a proper method of pathogenically oriented antiglaucomatous intervention, decreases surgical trauma, facilitates normalization of intraocular pressure and helps stabilizing the course of the disease. Another development is a modification of combined phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy ab interno, aimed at increasing visual and hypotensive results. Clinical studies showed high hypotensive efficacy of the combined pathogenically oriented surgical treatment of cataract and primary open-angle glaucoma.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624797","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.44022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.403481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.340868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.106844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Trabeculectomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabeculectomy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
