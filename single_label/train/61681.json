{"id":61681,"title":"CD44 standard and CD44v10 isoform expression on leukemia cells distinctly influences niche embedding of hematopoietic stem cells.","abstract":"A blockade of CD44 is considered a therapeutic option for the elimination of leukemia initiating cells. However, anti-panCD44 can interfere with hematopoiesis. Therefore we explored, whether a CD44 variant isoform (CD44v)-specific antibody can inhibit leukemia growth without attacking hematopoiesis. As a model we used CD44v10 transfected EL4 thymoma cells (EL4-v10).The therapeutic efficacy of anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 was evaluated after intravenous application of EL4/EL4-v10. Ex vivo and in vitro studies evaluated the impact of anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 as well as of EL4 and EL4-v10 on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in cocultures with bone marrow stroma cells with a focus on adhesion, migration, cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance.Intravenously injected EL4-v10 grow in bone marrow and spleen. Anti-panCD44 and, more pronounced anti-CD44v10 prolong the survival time. The higher efficacy of anti-CD44v10 compared to anti-panCD44 does not rely on stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or on promoting EL4-v10 apoptosis. Instead, EL4 compete with HSC niche embedding. This has consequences on quiescence and apoptosis-protecting signals provided by the stroma. Anti-panCD44, too, more efficiently affected embedding of HSC than of EL4 in the bone marrow stroma. EL4-v10, by catching osteopontin, migrated on bone marrow stroma and did not or weakly interfere with HSC adhesion. Anti-CD44v10, too, did not affect the HSC--bone marrow stroma crosstalk.The therapeutic effect of anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 is based on stimulation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The superiority of anti-CD44v10 is partly due to blocking CD44v10-stimulated osteopontin expression that could drive HSC out of the niche. However, the main reason for the superiority of anti-CD44v10 relies on neither EL4-v10 nor anti-CD44v10 severely interfering with HSC--stroma cell interactions that, on the other hand, are affected by EL4 and anti-panCD44. Anti-panCD44 disturbing HSC embedding in the osteogenic niche weakens its therapeutic effect towards EL4. Thus, as far as leukemic cells express CD44v isoforms, the therapeutic use of anti-panCD44 should be avoided in favor of CD44v-specific antibodies.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684724","annotations":[{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"CD44","weight":0.879193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.857202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Osteopontin","weight":0.756221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopontin"},{"name":"Thymoma","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymoma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.705591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.689325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.627802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.590938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.540761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"G0 phase","weight":0.202182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0_phase"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.140264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.134085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Crosstalk (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(biology)"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
