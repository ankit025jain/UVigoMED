{"id":46302,"title":"Spontaneous hepatitis C virus clearance in HIV patients with chronic hepatitis C bearing IL28B-CC alleles using antiretroviral therapy.","abstract":"A quarter of individuals acutely infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) clear the virus spontaneously. Once chronic infection is established, HCV elimination generally can only be achieved using specific antiviral therapy, such as peg-interferon-ribavirin. Herein, we report a group of chronically HIV/HCV-coinfected patients that cleared HCV spontaneously while being treated only with antiretrovirals.Retrospective analysis of all HIV-infected individuals with positive HCV antibodies (HCV-Abs) and negative serum HCV-RNA seen during 2012 at a reference HIV clinic in Madrid.From a total of 2366 HIV-infected individuals, 618 (26%) were HCV-Ab+, of whom 387 (62%) were positive for serum HCV-RNA. Individuals HCV-Ab+/HCV-RNA-negative were grouped into two categories--those that had eliminated HCV following a course of antiviral treatment (n = 198, 86%) and those who had cleared the virus spontaneously (n = 33, 14%). Eight with spontaneous clearance were HBsAg+ and might have cleared HCV as a result of viral interference. However, six (24%) out of the remaining 25 did so after being serum HCV-RNA+ for longer than 6 months (median 5.6 years, range 1.3-12 years). All harbored alleles and had undetectable plasma HIV-RNA on HAART around the time of HCV clearance.Spontaneous HCV clearance may occur in a subset of chronically HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on HAART harboring IL28B-CC. Given that antiretrovirals do not display any direct anti-HCV activity, recovery of innate immune responses could be responsible for these late HCV clearance episodes. Thus, periodic testing of serum HCV-RNA may be warranted in chronically HIV/HCV-coinfected patients on HAART harboring IL28B-CC alleles.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637541","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.542605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Madrid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
