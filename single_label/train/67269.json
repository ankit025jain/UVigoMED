{"id":67269,"title":"Isolation of Kurthia gibsonii from non-gonorrheal urethritis: implications for the pathomechanism upon surveying the literature.","abstract":"The incidence and number of species involved in the spectrum of sexually transmitted infections continue to increase. Laboratories have to be prepared for identification of unusual microbes. In our practice, a male patient had recurring urethritis and balanitis after having repeated unprotected insertive sexual intercourse with female piglets. He also had allergy to scents and some metals, otherwise he showed no general symptoms. Specimens were swabbed from the urethra, inflamed glans, rectum, mouth onto several culture media, subsequently isolates were tested for their morphology, biochemical activity. Kurthia gibsonii was isolated from urethra and glans. No concomitant infection with other microbes was detected, haemoculture was negative. Relying upon antibiotic sensitivity test, he was cured with 2 Ã— 500 mg oral cefuroxime for 15 days, and topical gentamycin cream for 2 months. This is the first reported sexually transmitted, zoonotic infection without generalization by Kurthia spp. We report first the antibiogram of K. gibsonii. Slight differences in the antibiotic sensitivity suggest independent infection and sensitivity of urethral and mucous membrane tissues to distinct K. gibsonii strains. Allergy of the patient might predispose to opportunistic infection. Such aspects ought to be tested in details in further cases.
