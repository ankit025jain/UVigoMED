{"id":52332,"title":"Xuezhikang attenuated the functional and morphological impairment of pancreatic islets in diabetic mice via the inhibition of oxidative stress.","abstract":"Xuezhikang, purified from red yeast rice, is a traditional Chinese medicine with pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the dysfunction of pancreas islet in diabetic condition and represents a promising therapeutical target for diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects and possible mechanisms of xuezhikang on the microenvironment and insulin secretion by pancreatic islets in db/db diabetic mice. Our results showed that xuezhikang decreased the blood glucose level by improving glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in db/db mice. Xuezhikang protected islets from hyperglycemic injury as illustrated by the conserved ?-cell content and microenvironment. Furthermore, xuezhikang potently inhibited the expression of key factors in oxidative stress. In addition, administration of xuezhikang caused an upregulated expression of glucose-sensing apparatus. These observations provide evidence that the influence of xuezhikang on oxidative stress may at least partly account for its protective effects on the microenvironment and insulin secretion function of pancreatic islets in diabetes.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24609055","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.89595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.768517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.750935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pleiotropy","weight":0.610915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.561523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.548831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.459561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.427246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"China","weight":0.382518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.370618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0960416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Islet","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
