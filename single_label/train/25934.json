{"id":25934,"title":"[Antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation].","abstract":"Stent thrombosis is a lethal complications and most important unresolved issues of the current PCI. For stent thrombosis prophylaxis of DES implantation patient, there is not a plan of surgery within six months at least, bleeding risk is low, to select patients with good adherence, and a new generation of low-thrombosis DES when implanted select the DES, and then select the appropriate stent size, the length using IVUS, OCT, the FFR, and without creating a dissection at the edges in the high-pressure expansion, and perform sufficient expansion, DAPT after surgery is at least 12 months it is desirable, but it is necessary to consider the balance of the benefit of thrombosis prophylaxis and risk of bleeding DES implantation site, the patient, to determine drug resistance, drug combination be considered in individual cases the selection DAPT period, the single agent.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163328","annotations":[{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.800493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.698873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.630035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Intravascular ultrasound","weight":0.619937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravascular_ultrasound"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.42868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.318346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.0682051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.0499999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Diethylstilbestrol","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
