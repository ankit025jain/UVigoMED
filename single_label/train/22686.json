{"id":22686,"title":"Imaging of lung transplant complications.","abstract":"Since the late 1980s, lung transplantation has emerged as a valid treatment option for some patients with advanced non-neoplastic lung disease. Long-term survival of lung transplant recipients, however, is lower than that of patients with other types of transplantation, because of numerous specific postoperative complications. Thanks to X-ray and CT, radiologists can guide clinicians, helped in this diagnostic approach by the time between the date of injury and date of transplantation. We will detail in this pictorial review the immediate and late surgical complications, the immunological complications, the infectious complications and other late complications.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525085","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.559079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.477054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Lung transplantation","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_transplantation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"}]}
