{"id":21641,"title":"Characteristic systemic cytokine responses in children with human bocavirus-positive lower respiratory tract infection.","abstract":"To investigate systemic cytokine responses in human bocavirus (HBoV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection, serum cytokine profiles were analyzed in HBoV positive-children (n=14) using multiplex immunoassay. Concentrations of TNF-a, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-8 on admission were significantly different from those of respiratory syncytial virus-positive children (n=28). This unique cytokine response might partly explain some characteristic clinical features of HBoV-associated respiratory infection.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593186","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.673071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Syncytium","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.490105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.489763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Lower respiratory tract infection","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human respiratory syncytial virus","weight":0.228885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
