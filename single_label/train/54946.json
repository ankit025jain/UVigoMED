{"id":54946,"title":"Human ciliary epithelium as a source of synthesis and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in neovascular glaucoma.","abstract":"Retinal ischemia-induced upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leads to endothelial proliferation of the anterior segment, resulting in neovascular glaucoma.To investigate the ciliary epithelium as a possible source of VEGF in human eyes enucleated for intractable neovascular glaucoma.In this proof-of-concept, laboratory-based study, 16 human enucleated eyes (8 with neovascular glaucoma and 8 as controls) were investigated.Presence of VEGF by immunohistochemical analysis (VEGF protein) and in situ hybridization (VEGF messenger RNA).In eyes with neovascular glaucoma, strong VEGF immunoreaction in the nonpigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary processes and in the retina was noted. In situ hybridization for VEGF messenger RNA revealed a similar pattern, with positive stain results only in eyes with neovascular glaucoma. A minimal amount of VEGF immunostaining was seen in control eyes.The nonpigmented ciliary epithelium is an important site of VEGF synthesis in patients with neovascular glaucoma. The ciliary epithelium may represent an additional focus of treatment in the management of neovascular glaucoma, especially in eyes that are nonresponsive to panretinal photocoagulation.","date":"2014-11-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25079256","annotations":[{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.800976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.702841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.516493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.513833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.427841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.409099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.396392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.393763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.268478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0201095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"}]}
