{"id":92738,"title":"Compensatory hyperhidrosis: results of pharmacologic treatment with oxybutynin.","abstract":"Hyperhidrosis may affect nearly 3% of the population, and thoracic/lumbar sympathectomy has been highly effective. Compensatory hyperhidrosis is a risk associated with surgical procedures, and its treatment is both complex and not well defined. Treatment of primary hyperhidrosis with oxybutynin has yielded positive results; however, its use in compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) has not been described.Twenty-one patients (11 female patients) received oxybutynin for severe CH at a median of 5 years after sympathectomy. Patients were evaluated to determine quality of life before starting oxybutynin and 6 weeks afterward; they assigned grades to determine improvement after 6 weeks and at their last consult visit for each site at which they complained of symptoms.Six and 15 patients underwent operation for axillary hyperhidrosis and palmar hyperhidrosis, respectively. Median follow-up time with oxybutynin was 377 days (49-1,831 days). Most common CH sites were the back (n=8) and abdomen (n=5). After 6 weeks, the quality of life improved in 71.4% of patients. Five patients stopped treatment: 2 because of unbearable dry mouth, 1 because of absence of pharmacologic response, 1 because of excessive somnolence, and 1 because of probable tachyphylaxis. At the last visit, 71.4% of patients presented with moderate to major improvement at the main sites at which sweating was noted.More than 70% of patients presented with improved overall quality of life and improvement at the most prominent site of compensatory sweating. Long-term treatment was ineffective in less than 25% of patients, primarily because of the side effects of dry mouth and somnolence. Oxybutynin appears to be effective in treating bothersome CH.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25173719","annotations":[{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.688708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Perspiration","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hyperhidrosis","weight":0.395556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.29127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Oxybutynin","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxybutynin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Sympathectomy","weight":0.0321906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathectomy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tachyphylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyphylaxis"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"831","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/831"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Order of the Companions of Honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Undescribed taxon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undescribed_taxon"},{"name":"Compensation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Compensatory damages","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensatory_damages"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
