{"id":34045,"title":"Prevalence and prognostic value of concealed structural abnormalities in patients with apparently idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias of left versus right ventricular origin: a magnetic resonance imaging study.","abstract":"Routine diagnostic work-up occasionally does not identify any abnormality among patients with monomorphic ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) of left ventricular (LV) origin. Aim of this study was to investigate the value of cardiac MRI (cMRI) for the diagnostic work-up and prognostication of these patients.Forty-six consecutive patients (65% males; mean age, 44±15 years) with monomorphic VAs of LV origin and negative routine diagnostic work-up were included. Seventy-four consecutive patients (60% males; mean age, 40±17 years) with apparently idiopathic monomorphic VAs of right ventricular origin served as control group. Both groups underwent comprehensive cMRI study and were followed-up for a median of 14 months (25th-75th percentiles, 7-37 months). The outcome event was an arrhythmic composite end point of sudden cardiac death or nonfatal episode of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring external cardioversion or appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy. The 2 groups of patients did not differ in age (P=0.14) and sex (P=0.57). No significant difference was observed between patients with VAs of LV origin and VAs of right ventricular origin about biventricular volumes and systolic function. cMRI demonstrated myocardial structural abnormalities in 19 (41%) patients with VAs of LV origin versus 4 (5%) patients with VAs of right ventricular origin (P<0.001). The outcome event occurred in 9 patients; myocardial structural abnormalities on cMRI were significantly related to the outcome event (hazard ratio, 41.6; 95% confidence interval, 5.2-225.0; P<0.001).Myocardial structural changes are detected by cMRI in a non-negligible proportion of patients with apparently idiopathic monomorphic VAs of LV origin and are associated with worse outcome.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771543","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator"},{"name":"Cardioversion","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioversion"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"},{"name":"Defibrillation","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.755251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.6732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.639658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.60711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.537478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.488493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.444575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.432449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.285129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Magnetic field","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"}]}
