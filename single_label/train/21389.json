{"id":21389,"title":"[Improvement of federal epidemiologic surveillance, provision of biologic security of population of Russian Federation].","abstract":"Realization of priority national project in the sphere of public health, population vaccine prophylaxis, as well as provision of human environment safety allowed to reduce the level of infectious and mass noninfectious diseases. In 2012 a reduction of morbidity for 30 nosologies including bacterial dysentery, acute hepatitis B and C, meningococcal infection, brucellosis, Crimea hemorrhagic fever, tick-borne viral encephalitis, tick-borne borreliosis, leptospirosis, syphilis morbidity was registered. Cases of acute paralytic poliomyelitis were not registered that gives evidence on the termination of circulation of wild poliovirus on the territory of Russia. For stabilization of epidemic situation in 2013 ensuring quality planning of population immunization within the framework of national calendar including migrants is necessary.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
