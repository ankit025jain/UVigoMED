{"id":56771,"title":"Laminar resorption in modified osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis procedure: a cause for concern.","abstract":"To analyze the cases of lamina resorption following the modified osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (MOOKP) procedure.Retrospective case series.Case records of 18 eyes (20 laminae) of 17 patients who showed evidence of lamina resorption out of the 85 eyes (87 laminae) of 82 patients that underwent MOOKP procedure between March 2003 and March 2013 were analyzed.Of the 17 patients (20 laminae), 1 underwent MOOKP procedure following multiple graft failures, 6 (7 laminae) belonged to the chemical injury group, and 10 (12 laminae) to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) group. Resorption was noted in 20 out of 87 laminae (22.98%). The need for removal of lamina/extrusion was noted in 3 out of the 7 laminae in the chemical injury group and 8 out of the 12 laminae in the SJS group. The mean duration to the first sign suggestive of resorption among patients of SJS was 36.7 months and among patients of chemical injury was 43 months. Vitritis was the presenting feature (7 of 20 laminae, 35%) indicative of early resorption, and the occurrence of the same in eyes with lamina resorption was noted to be statistically significant in comparison to controls (P<.001). Sixteen out of 20 laminae showed evidence of resorption superiorly.Vitritis was the most common presenting feature of lamina resorption and could be an indicator of lamina resorption. Resorption of the laminae was noted to occur along the aspect with thinner bone support in all eyes. Incidence of severe resorption with extrusion of cylinder/requiring lamina removal was noted to be higher among patients with SJS.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631477","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.53667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.477849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Multiple chemical sensitivity","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Special Judicial Squad","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Judicial_Squad"},{"name":"Resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorption"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0139019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"}]}
