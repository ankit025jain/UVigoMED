{"id":63115,"title":"Association of methylenetetrahytrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with the susceptibility of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Chinese population.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahytrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).A case-control study was conducted among 98 children with ALL and 93 age- and sex- matched non-ALL controls. Genotyping of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The odds ratios (ORs) of MTHFR genotypes were used to assess the associations of these polymorphisms with childhood ALL susceptibility.No significant differences were observed for frequencies of the 677CC, 677CT and 677TT genotypes between patients and controls. Frequencies of the 1298AA, 1298Â AC and 1298CC genotypes between the two groups were significantly different. The risk of ALL with the 1298C allele carriers (AC?+?CC) was elevated by 1.1 times compared with the AA genotype [OR?=?2.100; 95% CI (1.149; 3.837); P?=?0.015].The MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to childhood ALL in the Chinese population.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476575","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.448912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.436145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.152285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"837","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/837"},{"name":"1298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1298"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"The Automobile Association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
