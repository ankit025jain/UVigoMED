{"id":74684,"title":"The role of zinc in the pathogenesis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Implications of zinc homeostasis for proper CNS function.","abstract":"Zinc, the essential trace element, is known to play multiple biological functions in human organism. This metal is a component of many structural as well as regulatory and catalytic proteins. The precise regulation of zinc homeostasis is essential for central nervous system and for the whole organism. Zinc plays a significant role in the brain development and in the proper brain function at every stage of life. This article is a review of knowledge about the role of zinc in central nervous system (CNS) function. The influence of this biometal on etiopathogenesis, prevention and treatment of selected brain diseases and disorders was discussed. Zinc imbalance can result not only from insufficient dietary intake, but also from impaired activity of zinc transport proteins and zinc dependent regulation of metabolic pathways. It is known that some neurodegenerative processes are connected with zinc dyshomeostasis and it may influence the state of Alzheimer's disease, depression and ageing-connected loss of cognitive function. The exact role of zinc and zinc-binding proteins in CNS pathogenesis processes is being under intensive investigation. The appropriate zinc supplementation in brain diseases may help in the prevention as well as in the proper treatment of several brain dysfunctions.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265815","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.666255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.571378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.387117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.386135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.379299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.3092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.305493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.263883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Trace element","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_element"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Trace fossil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_fossil"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
