{"id":60728,"title":"Epithelioid hemangioma of the internal carotid artery: a case report supporting the reactive pathogenesis hypothesis of this vascular tumor.","abstract":"The pathogenesis of epithelioid hemangioma is intriguing and has remained a controversial topic in the medical literature. Whether its etiology follows a neoplastic or reactive process is unclear, but a history of traumatic insult to the involved region is common. We report a case of epithelioid hemangioma of the internal carotid artery in a child who had undergone cannulization of the internal jugular vein as an infant to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
