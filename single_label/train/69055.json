{"id":69055,"title":"CD8? Treg cells associated with decreasing disease activity after intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy in lupus nephritis with heavy proteinuria.","abstract":"We focus on the role of CD8(+) Treg cell in Intravenous methyl-prednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy in forty patients with active Class III/IV childhood lupus nephritis (LN) with heavy proteinuria. IVMP therapy for five days. From peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and renal tissues, we saw IVMP therapy definitely restoring both CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) and CD8(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cell number plus greater expression with intracellular IL-10 and granzyme B in CD8(+)FoxP3(+) Treg from PBMCs. IVMP-treated CD8(+)CD25(+) Treg cells directly suppressed CD4(+) T proliferation and induced CD4(+)CD45RO(+) apoptosis. Histologically, CD4(+)FoxP3(+) as well as CD8(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells appeared in renal tissue of LN patients before IVMP by double immunohistochemical stain. CD8(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells increased in 10 follow-up renal biopsy specimens after IVMP. Reverse correlation of serum anti-C1q antibody and FoxP3(+) Treg cells in PBMNCs (r?=?-0.714, P<0.01). After IVMP, serum anti-C1q antibody decrease accompanied increase of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells. CD8(+)Treg cells reduced interferon-r response in PBMCs to major peptide autoepitopes from nucleosomes after IVMP therapy; siRNA of FoxP3 suppressed granzyme B expression while decreasing CD8(+)CD25(+)Treg-induced CD4(+)CD45RO(+) apoptosis. Renal activity of LN by SLEDAI-2k in childhood LN was significantly higher than two weeks after IVMP (P<0.01). CD8(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells return in post-IVMP therapy and exert crucial immune modulatory effect to control autoimmune response in LN.DMR97-IRB-259.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475019","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.951721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.90816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.840432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.829791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.782266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.705314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Nucleosome","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.419455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.373882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.288801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.261989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Lupus nephritis","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis"},{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"}]}
