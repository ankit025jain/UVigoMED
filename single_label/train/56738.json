{"id":56738,"title":"Monitoring keratitis resolution with optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"Biomicroscopy is generally used, sometimes in conjunction with photography or ultrasound pachymetry, to monitor conditions involving stromal keratitis and edema. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), a technology typically used to examine the posterior segment, may be useful in monitoring the therapeutic interventions for conditions involving corneal edema such as disciform keratitis.Two cases of disciform keratitis were followed to resolution using SD-OCT with anterior segment imaging software (Cirrus 4000; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) to quantify decreasing edema throughout treatment. The thickest area of the cornea was located and measured across time using SD-OCT until resolution was achieved. Throughout each case, SD-OCT allowed precise localization of microcystic edema and keratic precipitates as well as the objective measurement of therapeutic interventions resulting in reduced edema and thickness.The use of SD-OCT allows objective measurements of corneal thickness and presents an additional method for following stromal keratitis with greater accuracy than can be appreciated using biomicroscopy alone.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637482","annotations":[{"name":"Optics","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.615237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.333016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.312081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.252069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.189281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Carl Zeiss AG","weight":0.180731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Dublin, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_California"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Carl Zeiss Meditec","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_Meditec"},{"name":"Dublin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)"},{"name":"Objective (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"List of neuroimaging software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neuroimaging_software"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Corneal pachymetry","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_pachymetry"}]}
