{"id":72272,"title":"Extragonadal teratomas of the adult abdomen and pelvis: a pictorial review.","abstract":"Teratomas comprise a spectrum of tumours that have striking imaging appearances and are commonly considered when evaluating a mass in the female pelvis. A subgroup of these tumours located in an extragonadal abdominopelvic location, in contrast, are extremely rare and can affect both sexes. Extragonadal teratomas can occur at all ages, are particularly unusual in adults and can cause confusion in the differential diagnosis, especially in children. Familiarity with the imaging features of the spectrum of teratomas within the abdominal cavity is therefore of great importance, as radiological diagnosis can guide treatment, prevent delays in diagnosis and avoid sequelae. This article summarizes the radiological appearances of these rare extragonadal tumours in adults in relation to their pathology, malignant potential, location and behaviour. Although uncommon, teratomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of extragonadal abdominal masses, particularly in young adults.
