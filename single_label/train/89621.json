{"id":89621,"title":"Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: pathoanatomy, epidemiology, and diagnosis.","abstract":"Although several hypotheses have been described to explain the cause of osteochondritis dissecans, no single hypothesis has been accepted in the orthopedic community. Given its increased incidence among athletes, most in the sports medicine community agree that repetitive microtrauma plays at least some role in its development. Knowledge regarding the epidemiology and pathoanatomy of osteochondritis dissecans has helped the understanding of osteochondritis dissecans; however, much is still to be learned about this condition and its cause. This article reviews the history of osteochondritis as it pertains to the current understanding of its pathoanatomy, epidemiology, and diagnostic features.
