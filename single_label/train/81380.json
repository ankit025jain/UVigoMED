{"id":81380,"title":"Eruption guidance appliance: a review.","abstract":"Eruption guidance appliance (Occlus-o-Guide) is recommended for early orthodontic treatment or prevention of malocclusions. The aim of this work is to review the literature about the use of eruption guidance appliance and to evaluate its effects during the treatment of Class II division I malocclusion, increased overbite, increased overjet, and anterior crowding. The aims of the eruption guidance appliance are to increase mandibular length and to increase anterior facial height without affecting maxillary growth. The effects of Occlus-O-Guide are mainly dentoalveolar such as mesial shift of lower molars, extrusion of posterior teeth, lingual tipping and retrusion of upper incisors, protrusion of lower incisors.All the analysed works showed great results in the treatment of anterior crowding, increase of the overbite and overjet, both in small deviations of the median line and in minor TMJ problems.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102468","annotations":[{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.810927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.672147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.667733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Tooth eruption","weight":0.486496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_eruption"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.486076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.453927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Division (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Median (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_(geometry)"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Division I (NCAA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
