{"id":88692,"title":"Current issues in radiation dose monitoring and reporting.","abstract":"Minimizing radiation exposure while optimizing image quality is critical in diagnostic medical imaging. Radiologic technologists face complex challenges when implementing dose monitoring and reporting systems to assist in radiation safety efforts. Challenges include communicating the risks of radiation exposure, handling variations in dose measurement techniques, and working with a lack of standardized nomenclature for examination types. With increasing attention on radiation safety, many solutions have been presented. A team approach to dose optimization with professionals nationwide can help establish a culture of radiation safety in medical imaging.
