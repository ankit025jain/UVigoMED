{"id":56844,"title":"Evaluation of a toric implantable collamer lens after corneal collagen crosslinking in treatment of early-stage keratoconus: 3-year follow-up.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the predictability, efficacy, safety, and stability in patients who received a toric implantable collamer lens (TICL) after collagen crosslinking in early-stage keratoconus.This prospective interventional case series study was conducted at the Alexandria Main University hospitals, University of Alexandria, Egypt. Sixteen eyes underwent implantation of a TICL (STAAR Surgical Inc) after crosslinking. The mean spherical refraction was -5.98 ± 4.39 diopters (D) (range, -0.50 to -14.50 D), and the mean cylinder was -4.91 ± 1.51 D (range, -2.50 to -7.75 D). Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), manifest and cycloplegic refraction, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), vault, intraocular pressure, and endothelial cell count (using specular microscopy) were evaluated during a 3-year follow-up.The mean Snellen decimal CDVA improved from 0.56 ± 0.13 (range, 0.40-0.80) preoperatively to 0.89 ± 0.17 (range, 0.60-1.20) at 3 years of the follow-up (P < 0.0001). The mean UDVA also improved significantly from 0.63 ± 0.14 before ICL implantation to 0.88 ± 0.18 after 3 years of the follow-up (P < 0.001). At 3 years, the mean spherical and cylindrical manifest refractions were 0.00 ± 0.18 D and -0.05 ± 0.14 D, respectively. At the end of the follow-up, the vault was 509.75 ± 141.47 ?m (range, 320-900) and the intraocular pressure was 11.94 ± 1.12 mm Hg. No complications occurred during the surgical procedures. No eye needed explantation or repositioning of the TICL. The endothelial cell count loss after 3 years was -8.98%.Correction of spherical and cylindrical refractive errors in keratoconic eyes by TICL implantation 12 months after crosslinking gave significantly promising outcomes, particularly in the astigmatic component of refraction.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619171","annotations":[{"name":"Cycloplegia","weight":0.841204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloplegia"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.813529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.771518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.732206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.552663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.522347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.474911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.425292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.255535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.19291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Alexandria","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.129465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0471077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Decimal","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Specular reflection","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
