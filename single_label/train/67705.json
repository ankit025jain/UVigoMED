{"id":67705,"title":"Genetic variants in interleukin genes and susceptibility to IgA nephropathy: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Many existing studies have demonstrated that genetic variants in interleukin (IL) genes might have an impact on an individual's susceptibility to IgA nephropathy (IgAN); but individually published results are inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationships between IL genetic variants and IgAN risk. We searched CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and China BioMedicine (CBM) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from inception through August 1, 2013. Meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. Seven case-control studies were included with a total of 1135 IgAN patients and 1603 healthy controls. Our meta-analysis results revealed that genetic variants in IL-1 and IL-1RN genes were associated with an increased risk of IgAN. However, similar associations were not observed in IL-6, IL-10, and IL-22R genes. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that there were significant associations between IL genetic variants and an increased risk of IgAN among both Asian and Caucasian populations. Meta-regression analyses showed that gene types may be a major source of heterogeneity. No publication bias was detected in this meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis suggests that IL genetic variants may contribute to the risk of IgAN, especially in IL-1 and IL-1RN genes.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Male Urogenital
