{"id":68322,"title":"Comparison of the effect of sertraline with behavioral therapy on semen parameters in men with primary premature ejaculation.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of sertraline on semen parameters and comparison of its effect with behavioral therapy (BT) in men with primary premature ejaculation.In this single-blinded clinical trial, a total of 60 married men with primary premature ejaculation were randomly divided into 2 groups: the sertraline group (n = 30, sertraline 25 mg/day for 1 week followed by 50 mg/day for 3 months) and the BT group (n = 30, using BT technique for 3 months). Semen analysis was applied, and the results were compared between groups before and 3 months after intervention.The significant reduction in sperm concentration (10(5)/mL) and percentage of normal morphology was reported in sertraline group (P <.05). The percentage of sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation after intervention in sertraline group was significantly higher than BT group (P = .004). There was no significant change in semen parameters in patients treated using BT.Our study revealed detrimental effects of sertraline on some semen parameters. It should particularly be considered in patients who are trying to conceive. It seems BT is a safe method without any side effect on semen analysis parameters.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529582","annotations":[{"name":"Premature ejaculation","weight":0.825349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.605426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Sertraline","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.426611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.175367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"BT Group","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Group"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
