{"id":82665,"title":"Bridging the gap between preventive and restorative dentistry: identification of caries risk factors and strategies for minimizing risk.","abstract":"Following the introduction of CAMBRA (Caries Management by Risk Assessment) in 2007, a number of recommendations for office protocols were introduced, and many companies have formulated products and procedures for implementing CAMBRA. As a result, the implementation of a caries management program can be confounding and overwhelming to a dental practitioner. Understanding risk factors as they contribute to the caries process can help mitigate confusion and guide the practitioner when selecting materials for their practice. Ultimately, knowing how the risk factors play a role in the progression of dental caries will lead to appropriate risk management and product recommendations. The purpose of this article is to discuss the contribution of risk factors to the caries process and to introduce strategies that restorative dentists can utilize to minimize caries risk.
