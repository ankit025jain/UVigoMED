{"id":91309,"title":"Use of an endoscopic urology basket to remove bronchial foreign body in the pediatric population.","abstract":"Foreign body (FB) aspiration is a common problem in the pediatric population. Rigid bronchoscopy is considered the treatment of choice for removal of tracheobronchial FB. This is a report of two cases of tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration that were managed using an endoscopic urology basket through a flexible bronchoscope. This report's main purpose is to inform physicians on the benefit of flexible bronchoscopy and of the potential use of the endoscopic urology basket for tracheobronchial FB retrieval. We hope that the flexible bronchoscopy and the endoscopic basket will become a standard tool in FB retrieval kits for pediatric otolaryngologists who deal with this issue on a routine basis.
