{"id":80966,"title":"[Clinical experience on treating Toxoplasma gondii infection during pregnancy by using acetyl spiramycin combined with azithromycin].","abstract":"To explore an effective therapy for pregnant Toxoplasma gondii infection by using acetyl spiramycin combined with azithromycin.ELISA and PCR were used to diagnose and evaluate the therapy efficiency to toxoplasmosis in pregnant women.The serological test showed that the positive rates of specific antibodies IgM and IgG to Toxoplasma gondii in 285 pregnant women were 1.05% (3/285) and 5.97% (17/285), respectively. All the 3 cases of serum IgM positive pregnant women received the amniotic fluid PCR tests for Toxoplasma gondii DNA and 2 were positive, and they received spiramycin combined with azithromycin. After the therapy, their serum IgM antibody specific to Toxoplasma gondii and positive amniotic fluid PCR test for Toxoplasma gondii DNA turned to be negative.Acetyl spiramycin in combination with azithromycin is effective in the treatment of pregnant toxoplasmosis.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490384","annotations":[{"name":"Toxoplasma gondii","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Toxoplasmosis","weight":0.826077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Azithromycin","weight":0.813961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.729003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Spiramycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiramycin"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Acetyl","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl"}]}
