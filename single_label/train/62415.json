{"id":62415,"title":"New approaches to management of multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Multiple myeloma is still an incurable disease with pattern of regression and remission followed by multiple relapses raising from the residual myeloma cells surviving even in the patients who achieve complete clinical response to treatment. New antimyeloma drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib have dramatically changed treatment paradigm leading to both tumor reduction and tumor suppression. Much progress has been made, but still many unsolved questions remain. In the mode of sequencing treatment for patients with multiple myeloma, we are still using old drugs such as the alkylating agent melphalan, which continues to play a central role in the transplantation setting. Newer drugs are now emerging and are being tested: monoclonal antibodies, histone deacetylase (romidespsin), MLN9708 (ixazomib) a new oral proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, signal transduction modulator perifosine. Many advances have been made, but there is still a long way to go.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578203","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Melphalan","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melphalan"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Perifosine","weight":0.727383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perifosine"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase","weight":0.718657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Alkylating agent","weight":0.613041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylating_agent"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.599349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.357746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Proteasome inhibitor","weight":0.356138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.339153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Alkylation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylation"}]}
