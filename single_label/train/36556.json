{"id":36556,"title":"Multisegment coloboma in a case of Marfan syndrome: another possible effect of increased TGF? signaling.","abstract":"Colobomata are etiologically heterogeneous and may occur as an isolated defect or as a feature of a variety of single-gene disorders, chromosomal syndromes, or malformation syndromes. Although not classically associated with Marfan syndrome, colobomata have been described in several reports of Marfan syndrome, typically involving the lens and rarely involving other ocular structures. While colobomata of the lens have been described in Marfan syndrome, there are very few reports of coloboma involving other ocular structures. We report a newborn boy presenting with coloboma of the iris, lens, retina, and optic disk who was subsequently diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is a disorder of increased TGF? signaling, and recent work in the mouse model suggests a role for TGF? signaling in eye development and coloboma formation, suggesting a causal association between Marfan syndrome and coloboma.
