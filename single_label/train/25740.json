{"id":25740,"title":"[Using meldonium to improve the adaptation of patients with cardiovascular disease to the effects of heat and correction of associated oxidative stress].","abstract":"Given that prolonged exposure to extreme climatic situations may play a role independent of stress factors, influencing the course of the underlying disease, the authors considered appropriate assessment of the effectiveness of additional prophylactic administration of drugs that increase the body's resistance to stress (adaptogens). The purpose of the study - to evaluate the effect of oxidative stress on meldonium, hemodynamics and quality of life of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in extreme climatic conditions (summer heat). The study included 56 patients with CVD aged 38-75 years. Patients were randomized into two groups: active management (M), which in addition to basic therapy during 3 summer months received meldonium (500 mg/day), and control. The following parameters were measured: office blood pressure (BP), blood plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein. MDA/SOD ratio was calculated. Visual analogue scale was used for assessment of quality of life. Meldonium treated patients demonstrated marked reduction of systolic BP and heart rate during heat, increased sodium level at the 2nd visit, improved quality of life. These changes corresponded to adaptive responses of healthy men. No significant dynamics of these parameters occurred in control group. MDA level during heat increased in both groups (p<0.05) but MDA/SOD ratio, which characterizes the \"oxidation potential\" of blood, increased significantly during the summer heat only in the control group. Meldonium can be used as an adaptogen in CVD patients during the summer heat.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177814","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.916687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.565631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.44852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.383031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.354654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.216682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.14736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine"},{"name":"Adaptogen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptogen"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Reduction potential","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_potential"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
