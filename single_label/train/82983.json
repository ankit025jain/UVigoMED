{"id":82983,"title":"Site specific properties of carious dentin matrices biomodified with collagen cross-linkers.","abstract":"To assess in non-cavitated carious teeth the mechanical properties of dentin matrix by measuring its reduced modulus of elasticity and the effect of dentin biomodification strategies on three dentin matrix zones: caries-affected, apparently normal dentin below caries-affected zone and sound dentin far from carious site.Nano-indentations were performed on dentin matrices of carious molars before and after surface modification using known cross-linking agents (glutaraldehyde, proanthocyanidins from grape seed extract and carbodiimide).Statistically significant differences were observed between dentin zones of demineralized dentin prior to surface biomodification (P < 0.05). Following surface modification, there were no statistically significant differences between dentin zones (P < 0.05). An average increase of 30-fold, 2-fold and 2.2-fold of the reduced modulus of elasticity was observed following treatments of the three dentin zones with proanthocyanidin, carbodiimide and glutaraldehyde, respectively.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479274","annotations":[{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Elastic modulus","weight":0.738152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.651102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.404527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.356024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.334462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Glutaraldehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutaraldehyde"},{"name":"Grape seed extract","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape_seed_extract"},{"name":"Carbodiimide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbodiimide"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Grape","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape"},{"name":"Absolute value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Site-specific art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_art"},{"name":"Surface modification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_modification"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Specific properties","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_properties"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
