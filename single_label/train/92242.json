{"id":92242,"title":"Photoprotection of human skin beyond ultraviolet radiation.","abstract":"Photoprotection of human skin by means of sunscreens or daily skin-care products is traditionally centered around the prevention of acute (e.g. sunburn) and chronic (e.g. skin cancer and photoaging) skin damage that may result from exposure to ultraviolet rays (UVB and UVA). Within the last decade, however, it has been appreciated that wavelengths beyond the ultraviolet spectrum, in particular visible light and infrared radiation, contribute to skin damage in general and photoaging of human skin in particular. As a consequence, attempts have been made to develop skin care/sunscreen products that not only protect against UVB or UVA radiation but provide photoprotection against visible light and infrared radiation as well. In this article, we will briefly review the current knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for visible light/infrared radiation-induced skin damage and then, based on this information, discuss strategies that have been successfully used or may be employed in the future to achieve photoprotection of human skin beyond ultraviolet radiation. In this regard we will particularly focus on the use of topical antioxidants and the challenges that result from the task of showing their efficacy.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433486","annotations":[{"name":"Photoprotection","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoprotection"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Sunscreen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.641518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Photoaging","weight":0.607044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoaging"},{"name":"Human skin","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.393744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0468441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0214799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Ray (optics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(optics)"}]}
