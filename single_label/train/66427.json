{"id":66427,"title":"Successful unintentional ABO-incompatible renal transplantation: Blood group A1B donor into an A2B recipient.","abstract":"To report a successful unintentional transplantation of a deceased donor kidney from an \"incompatible\" A1B donor into a recipient who was blood group A2B with unsuspected preformed anti-A1 antibodies.The donor and recipient were both typed for ABO antigens. The recipient was tested for ABO and non-ABO antibodies. The recipient was typed for HLA class I and class II antigens, including HLA antibody screen. The T-and B-flow cytometry crossmatch test was performed using standard protocol.The donor-recipient pair was a complete six-antigen human leukocyte antigen mismatch, but final T- and B-flow cytometry cross-match tests were compatible. The recipient was a 65-year-old woman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy who underwent kidney transplantation from a 46-year-old brain-dead standard criteria donor. The recipient's RBCs were negative with A1 lectin, and the recipient was thus typed as an A2 subgroup. Anti-A1 could be demonstrated in the recipient's plasma. The donor's RBCs were positive with A1 lectin, thereby conferring an A1 blood type.It is safe to transplant across the A1/A2 blood group barrier provided that the preformed antibodies are not reactive at 37Â°C and with anti-human globulin.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713746","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Diabetic nephropathy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy"},{"name":"Coombs test","weight":0.836387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coombs_test"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Lectin","weight":0.781072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin"},{"name":"Brain death","weight":0.779947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.757794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"ABO blood group system","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cross-matching","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-matching"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.627535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.512818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.456946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"CYP1A2","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP1A2"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
