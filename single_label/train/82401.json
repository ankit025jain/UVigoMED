{"id":82401,"title":"Neuroepithelial structures associated with the subepithelial nerve plexus of taste buds: a fortuitous finding resembling the juxtaoral organ of Chievitz.","abstract":"Numerous embryologic epithelial remnants are described in the oral region, when intimately associated with peripheral nerves, may pose a diagnostic pitfall for pathologists. The literature contains cases in which the juxtaoral organ of Chievitz (JOC) was identified in specimens removed because of a malignancy and the correct recognition of this structure potentially avoids unnecessary treatment. To our knowledge, this is the description of neuroepithelial structures similar to the JOC were found in the posterior tongue in close association with the subepithelial nerve plexus of taste buds. Four cases are reported. The nerve fibers of the subepithelial nerve plexus showed strong positivity for S-100, CD56, and synaptophysin, and were intimately associated with epithelial islands. CD56 showed positivity around the periphery of the epithelial islands. Proper recognition of these anatomic structures is crucial to prevent misdiagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma with perineural invasion.
