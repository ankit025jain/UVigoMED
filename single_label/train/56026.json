{"id":56026,"title":"Models of low vision care: past, present and future.","abstract":"Over the last 50 years, the concept of a low vision service has changed considerably. It has moved away from just the optometrist or optician dispensing magnifiers, to having a large team working across the health and social/ community care sectors, with voluntary organisations often playing an important role. This paper reviews how low vision rehabilitation services have evolved and what models of low vision care are currently available. It goes on to consider the effectiveness and accessibility of low vision care. Finally it explores what the future might hold for low vision services, to be better prepared for the increase in the number of people with low vision and their evolving needs and what role(s) an optometrist might have within these anticipated developments.
