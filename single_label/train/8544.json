{"id":8544,"title":"Aortic valve ChromaFlo®: a feasibility study of aortic regurgitation and effective annular aortic area assessment in a porcine model.","abstract":"Aortic valve annular complex was rediscovered after the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement; and imaging has been crucial in determining the annular geometry. Although the procedure has evolved, complications related to the annular mechanical response following valve implantation, such as aortic insufficiency, still occur in practice. We documented the feasibility of invasive assessment of aortic valve annular complex and the detection of induced aortic insufficiency via intravascular ultrasound with ChromaFlo® technology in a porcine model.
