{"id":28881,"title":"Repeated intravenous administrations of teneurin-C terminal associated peptide (TCAP)-1 attenuates reinstatement of cocaine seeking by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in rats.","abstract":"The teneurin c-terminal associated peptides (TCAP) have been implicated in the regulation of the stress response, possibly via a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-related mechanism. We have previously shown that repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of TCAP-1 attenuate the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by CRF in rats. Here, we determined whether intravenous (IV) administrations of TCAP-1 would likewise attenuate CRF-induced reinstatement, and whether this effect would vary depending on the rat's history of cocaine self administration. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 days, during once daily sessions that were either 3h (\"short access\"; ShA) or 6h (\"long access\"; LgA). Rats were then given five daily injections of TCAP-1 (0, 300, or 3,000 pmol, IV) in their home cage. Subsequently, they were returned to the self-administration chambers where extinction of cocaine seeking and testing for CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking was carried out. Repeated IV administrations of TCAP-1 were efficacious in attenuating CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, but at different doses in ShA and LgA rats. Taken together, the findings extend previous work showing a consistent effect of repeated ICV TCAP-1 on CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, and point to a potential therapeutic benefit of TCAP-1 in attenuating cocaine seeking behaviors.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768621","annotations":[{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.785439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.733809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.48229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.375049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Corticotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.240674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Fight-or-flight response","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Transaction Capabilities Application Part","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_Capabilities_Application_Part"},{"name":"Extinction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Taken (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"George W.
