{"id":37234,"title":"Validation of transcutaneous bilirubin nomogram for identifying neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in healthy Chinese term and late-preterm infants: a multicenter study.","abstract":"to prospectively validate a previously constructed transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) nomogram for identifying severe hyperbilirubinemia in healthy Chinese term and late-preterm infants.this was a multicenter study that included 9,174 healthy term and late-preterm infants in eight hospitals of China. TcB measurements were performed using a JM-103 bilirubinometer. TcB values were plotted on a previously developed TcB nomogram, to identify the predictive ability for subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia.in the present study, 972 neonates (10.6%) developed significant hyperbilirubinemia. The 40(th) percentile of the nomogram could identify all neonates who were at risk of significant hyperbilirubinemia, but with a low positive predictive value (PPV) (18.9%). Of the 453 neonates above the 95(th) percentile, 275 subsequently developed significant hyperbilirubinemia, with a high PPV (60.7%), but with low sensitivity (28.3%). The 75(th) percentile was highly specific (81.9%) and moderately sensitive (79.8%). The area under the curve (AUC) for the TcB nomogram was 0.875.this study validated the previously developed TcB nomogram, which could be used to predict subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia in healthy Chinese term and late-preterm infants. However, combining TcB nomogram and clinical risk factors could improve the predictive accuracy for severe hyperbilirubinemia, which was not assessed in the study. Further studies are necessary to confirm this combination.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508013","annotations":[{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"China","weight":0.452892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.26082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.230354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.132724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Nomogram","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Jamaica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica"},{"name":"972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/972"},{"name":"875","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/875"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Transdermal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal"},{"name":"Burstable billing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstable_billing"},{"name":"75th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of hospitals in Rhode Island","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_Rhode_Island"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Minuscule 453","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_453"}]}
