{"id":20136,"title":"Construction and characterization of a Vibrio cholerae serogroup O139 vaccine candidate by genetic engineering.","abstract":"The present study aimed to construct and evaluate the live attenuated Vibrio cholerae serogroup O139 vaccine candidate, in which genes encoding protective antigens were integrated into the chromosomal DNA. Using the initial strain, O139-ZJ9693, the toxin-linked cryptic (TLC) and cholera toxin (CTX) genetic elements and repeats in the toxin (RTX) gene cluster were deleted from its chromosomal DNA, and the cholera toxin genes, ctxB and rstR, were transferred into the chromosome to construct the candidate vaccine strain. The expression of ctxB and the vaccine virulence were then examined. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzymatic digestion and electrophoresis were performed to confirm that TLC, CTX and RTX were deleted, and that ctxB and rstR were transferred into the vaccine candidate DNA. According to the preliminary evaluation, the ctxB gene exhibited cholera toxin subunit B expression, and no enterotoxigenic or cytotoxic effects were observed in this strain. In conclusion, a recombinant strain containing genes encoding protective antigens that replaced virulence-associated genes was successfully constructed in the present study; this candidate strain may have the potential to be utilized to further evaluate the immune response.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676972","annotations":[{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.765444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.728508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.683517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.656852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.650644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.630156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.445466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Cholera toxin","weight":0.368992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_toxin"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Gene cluster","weight":0.0750848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_cluster"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Enterotoxin","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Integrase","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase"},{"name":"Crypsis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypsis"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Zhejiang","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang"}]}
