{"id":63219,"title":"Lack of association between IL-4 -588C>T polymorphism and NHL susceptibility.","abstract":"The relationship of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with the presence of interleukin-4 genetic polymorphism -588C>T has been reported with inconsistent results. The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the association between -588C>T polymorphism and NHL susceptibility. Two investigators independently searched Medline and the Cochrane Library up to September 20, 2013. Pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated using a fixed or random effects model. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manage 5.0 and Stata 11. Of the six case-control studies selected for this meta-analysis, a total of 1,909 NHL cases and 1,834 controls were included. The combined results based on all studies suggested that -588C>T was not associated with NHL risk under all genetic models. When stratifying for race, no noteworthy associations were observed in mixed populations or Caucasians. This meta-analysis suggests that IL-4 -588C>T polymorphism might not be a risk factor for NHL risk. However, further well-designed studies are required to confirm our findings.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464250","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.732141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.502697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.401339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.29291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.117205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"September 20","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_20"},{"name":"834","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/834"},{"name":"909","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Manage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manage"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
