{"id":69698,"title":"Tumor suppression by the Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase: mechanisms and opportunities.","abstract":"Tumor suppressors with widespread impact on carcinogenesis control broad spectra of oncogenic pathways. Protein degradation is an emerging mechanism by which tumor suppressors regulate a diversity of pathways and is exemplified by the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. Rapidly accumulating data indicate that SCF(Fbw7) regulates a network of crucial oncoproteins. Importantly, the FBXW7 gene, which encodes Fbw7, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. These studies are yielding important new insights into tumorigenesis and may soon enable therapies targeting the Fbw7 pathway. Here, we focus on the mechanisms and consequences of Fbw7 deregulation in cancers and discuss possible therapeutic approaches.
