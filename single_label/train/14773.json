{"id":14773,"title":"Disturbing miR-182 and -381 inhibits BRD7 transcription and glioma growth by directly targeting LRRC4.","abstract":"Inactivated LRRC4 has been clinically detected in gliomas, and promoter hypermethylation has been implicated as the mechanism of inactivation in some of those tumors. Our previous researches indicated that LRRC4 is a target gene of miR-381, the interaction of miR-381 and LRRC4 is involved in glioma growth. In this study, we demonstrate that LRRC4 is a target gene of the other microRNA, miR-182. We found that the high expression of miR-182 and miR-381 in gliomas are involved in pathological malignant progression. The silencing of miR-182 and miR-381 inhibited the proliferation in vitro and growth of glioma cell with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging by intracranial transplanted tumor model in rats. We also demonstrated that BRD7, a transcriptional cofactor for p53, is highly expressed and negatively correlated with LRRC4 expression in gliomas. Disturbing miR-182 and miR-381 affected transcriptional regulation of the BRD7 gene. This finding was verified by ectopic overexpression of LRRC4 or restoration of endogenous LRRC4 expression by treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-dC. Taken together, miR-182 and miR-381 may be a useful therapeutic target for treatment of glioma.
