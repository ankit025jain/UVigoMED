{"id":74179,"title":"Seed-weighted random walk ranking for cancer biomarker prioritisation: a case study in leukaemia.","abstract":"A central focus of clinical proteomics for cancer is to identify protein biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic application potential. Network-based analyses have been used in computational disease-related gene prioritisation for several years. The Random Walk Ranking (RWR) algorithm has been successfully applied to prioritising disease-related gene candidates by exploiting global network topology in a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. Increasing the specificity and sensitivity ofbiomarkers may require consideration of similar or closely-related disease phenotypes and molecular pathological mechanisms shared across different disease phenotypes. In this paper, we propose a method called Seed-Weighted Random Walk Ranking (SW-RWR) for prioritizing cancer biomarker candidates. This method uses the information of cancer phenotype association to assign to each gene a disease-specific, weighted value to guide the RWR algorithm in a global human PPI network. In a case study of prioritizing leukaemia biomarkers, SW-RWR outperformed a typical local network-based analysis in coverage and also showed better accuracy and sensitivity than the original RWR method (global network-based analysis). Our results suggest that the tight correlation among different cancer phenotypes could play an important role in cancer biomarker discovery.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864375","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.80129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.552922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.511382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.43953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Random walk","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Topology","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Network topology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology"},{"name":"Candidate gene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"}]}
