{"id":84400,"title":"High fatigue scores among older Dutch nurse anesthetists.","abstract":"In The Netherlands, hospital care production pressure recently increased substantially, while the number of nurse anesthetists available did not match this rise. The longtime existing norm of no night shifts for nurses beyond the age of 55 years was increased to age 57 to meet the demand for more nurse anesthetists. In this pilot study, we aimed to determine the level of fatigue and its correlation with demographic items among this category of employees. A validated questionnaire was distributed to all Dutch nurse anesthetists above 50 years of age working in Dutch hospitals, which asked for their level of fatigue. The Checklist Individual Strength Questionnaire was used to measure fatigue. Overall, 105 of 115 potential participants completed the questionnaire (response rate, 91%). The mean scores (+/- standard deviation) were as follows: total fatigue, 81.3 +/- 8.3; subjective fatigue, 31.4 +/- 3.2; physical activity, 13.1 +/- 2.2; motivation, 16.8 +/- 2.6; and concentration, 20.0 +/- 3.8. No correlation could be demonstrated between demographic characteristics and fatigue. Dutch nurse anesthetists above the age of 50 years show a high fatigue score and therefore need special attention to prevent them from harmful physical and psychological effects and to sustain maximal patient safety.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109162","annotations":[{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.748753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.671311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.368433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.262541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.209512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.195637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.135315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.107822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.104122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.0480512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Nurse anesthetist","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_anesthetist"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Courage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
