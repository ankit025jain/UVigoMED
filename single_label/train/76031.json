{"id":76031,"title":"Incidental parathyroidectomy during thyroid surgery: risk factors, incidence, and outcomes.","abstract":"Incidental removal of the parathyroid glands is common in some cases. In this trial, we investigated the risk factors, incidence, and outcomes associated with incidental excision of the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery.The records of patients who had undergone thyroid surgery in our department between January 2006 and December 2011 were retrospectively evaluated.A total of 801 patients were enrolled in the trial. The number of incidental parathyroidectomies was determined as 19 (2.3%). Statistical evaluation revealed that sex (P > 0.05) and type of surgical operation (P > 0.05) were not associated with a significant impact on incidental parathyroidectomies. However, the rate of incidental parathyroidectomies was determined to be statistically significantly high among patients with malignant conditions (P < 0.05). Hypocalcemia was observed to be statistically significant in patients with an incidental parathyroidectomy (P < 0.05).Incidental parathyroidectomy is a rare condition in centers specializing in endocrine surgery. Furthermore, the parathyroid glands should always be explored during dissection in patients with malignancies. The clinical manifestation of hypocalcemia is a common condition observed after incidental parathyroidectomy.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558564","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.59084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypocalcaemia","weight":0.450542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcaemia"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Parathyroidectomy","weight":0.13934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroidectomy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Endocrine surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
