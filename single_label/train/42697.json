{"id":42697,"title":"Can sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction improve the detection of small hypervascular liver nodules with dual-energy CT?","abstract":"To optimize a dual-energy computed tomographic protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithms for improving small nodules detection.The raw data of a dual-energy computed tomographic arterial acquisition of a cirrhotic patient were reconstructed with a standard filtered back projection (B20f) and 3 iterative (I26, I30, I31) kernels with different strength (S3-S5). The 80-kilovolt (peak) (kVp) and the linear blended (DE_0.5) images (80-140 kVp) were analyzed. For each series, 8-subcentimeter low-contrast lesions were simulated within the liver. Four radiologists performed a detectability test and rated the image quality (5-point scales) in all images.The sensitivity increased from 31% (B20f) to 87.5% with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction S5 kernels without a difference between 80-kVp and DE_0.5 series (W test, P = 0.062). The highest image quality rating was 3.8 (B20 DE_0.5), without difference from DE_0.5 I30-S5 and I26-S3.Iterative reconstructions increase the sensitivity for detecting abdominal lesions, even in the 80-kVp series. The kernel I30-S5 was considered the best.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834888","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.726737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.243256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Filtered back projection","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtered_back_projection"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Iteration","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Iterative reconstruction","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_reconstruction"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"German language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Data acquisition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Tomographic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Projection (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Filter (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Infiniti I","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniti_I"},{"name":"Rear projection effect","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_projection_effect"},{"name":"30S","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30S"},{"name":"Kernel (computing)","weight":0.0150458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computing)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"BMW 5 Series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Raw data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data"},{"name":"Volvo B18 engine","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_B18_engine"}]}
