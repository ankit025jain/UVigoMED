{"id":57130,"title":"Second-dose methotrexate in ectopic pregnancies: the role of beta human chorionic gonadotropin.","abstract":"To evaluate the role of ?-hCG levels on days 1, 4, and 7 after methotrexate as predictors for second-dose requirement and success.Retrospective cohort study.Tertiary university-affiliated hospital.A total of 1,703 patients were admitted because of ectopic pregnancy. Four hundred nine received methotrexate, of whom 73 women required a second dose.The \"single-dose\" methotrexate protocol with 50 mg/m(2) was administered to patients with progressing ectopic pregnancy. Surgical intervention was performed in cases of methotrexate second-dose treatment failure.Methotrexate second-dose requirement and success according to ?-hCG levels on days 1, 4 and 7.Second-dose methotrexate was successful in 58 patients (79.4%, success group), whereas 15 patients (20.6%) failed treatment and required surgical intervention (failure group). The medians of ?-hCG levels on days 1, 4, and 7 were significantly higher in the \"failure group\" (1,601 vs. 2,844, 2,164 vs. 3,225, and 1,915 vs. 3,745 mIU/mL, respectively). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that day-1 ?-hCG levels were the only significant independent variable for second-dose treatment outcome. The receiver operating characteristic curve for ?-hCG levels on day 1 was 0.727, and at a cutoff value of 2,234 mIU/mL the sensitivity and specificity reached the optimum for treatment success (77.5% and 73.3%, respectively).Day-1 ?-hCG levels were the only predictors for methotrexate second-dose requirement and treatment success. The cutoff value of ?-hCG on day 1 with the optimal treatment results was found to be 2,234 mIU/mL.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241368","annotations":[{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.822386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.559121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.542075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.480411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.306296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.216493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"844","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/844"},{"name":"234","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/234"},{"name":"915","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/915"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Median (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_(geometry)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"}]}
