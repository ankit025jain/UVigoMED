{"id":45676,"title":"[Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the distal jejunum and ileum].","abstract":"Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) of the distal jejunum and ileum derive from serotonin-producing enterochromaffin (EC) cells. Due to their low proliferation rate and their infiltrative growth, they are often discovered at an advanced disease stage when metastasis has already occurred. The biology of these tumours is different from other NEN of the digestive tract. In order to standardise and improve diagnosis and therapy, the guidelines for the diagnosis and clinical management of jejuno-ileal NEN as well as for the management of patients with liver and other distant metastases from NEN were revised by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) in 2012. This review focuses on aspects relevant for surgical pathology.
