{"id":19579,"title":"Maintenance of immunological homeostasis by Indukantha ghritha in patients with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections-a pilot study.","abstract":"Indukantha Ghritha (IG), a polyherbal drug used for centuries in Ayurveda, is claimed to be successful in the treatment of respiratory diseases and as a rejuvenating drug. To date, little is known about the immunomodulatory role of IG in recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (RURIs). This study was designed to scientifically validate and evaluate the immunological response mechanisms in patients with RURI. Primarily, immunological functioning of the lymphocyte subsets, Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and immunoglobulins was evaluated before and after administration of IG in patients (n=48) and normal subjects (n=25) for a period of 28 days. Flow cytometry revealed a significant increase in the CD3+, CD4+ T cells and CD56+ natural killer cells with a concomitant reduction of percentage of B cells during IG treatment. Increased Th1 cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-?, and decreased Th2 cytokine, IL-4, were also observed with IG treatment. IgG was markedly decreased, and IgM was increased with no changes in IgA. Assessment of liver and kidney functions and cholesterol levels was within normal limits in patients administered IG, which reinforces its drug utility as a non-toxic polyherbal drug. Overall, IG provides symptomatic relief by functioning as a potent immunostimulator that can induce type 1 and decrease type 2 immune responses thereby maintaining immunological homeostasis in RURI patients.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
