{"id":72662,"title":"Minimally invasive surgery in the management of abdominal tumors in children.","abstract":"The application of minimally invasive surgical techniques to pediatric abdominal tumors is a controversial application towards the surgical management of childhood cancer. Although general pediatric surgeons practice minimally invasive surgery techniques in a vast array of abdominal cases, its role in pediatric oncology is still developing, with no consensus in North America about its use for pediatric solid abdominal tumors. The purposes of this article are to review the current literature about the use of minimally invasive surgery in pediatric abdominal oncology and to examine established indications, procedures and technologic advances.
