{"id":50624,"title":"IGF1 induces cell proliferation in human pituitary tumors - functional blockade of IGF1 receptor as a novel therapeutic approach in non-functioning tumors.","abstract":"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and its receptor display potent proliferative and antiapoptotic activities and are considered key players in malignancy. The objective of the study was to explore the role of IGF1 and its downstream pathways in the proliferation of non-functioning pituitary tumor cells and to develop a targeted therapeutic approach for the treatment of these tumors. Cultures of human non-functioning pituitary adenomas and the non-secreting immortalized rat pituitary tumor cell line MtT/E were incubated with IGF1, IGF1 receptor inhibitor or both, and cell viability, proliferation and signaling were examined. Our results show that IGF1 elevated cell proliferation and enhanced cell cycle progression as well as the expression of cyclins D1 and D3. IGF1 also induced the phosphorylation of ERK, Akt and p70S6K. On the other hand, the selective IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 abrogated IGF1-induced cell proliferation as well as IGF1 receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769281","annotations":[{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.804709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.634572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.610216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.554352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.536844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.488761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.433683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"P70-S6 Kinase 1","weight":0.413579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P70-S6_Kinase_1"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.361427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.255282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Biological immortality","weight":0.241683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D1"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Ribosomal protein s6","weight":0.015722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_protein_s6"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
