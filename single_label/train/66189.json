{"id":66189,"title":"Intraurethral injection of autologous minced skeletal muscle: a simple surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence.","abstract":"Intraurethral injection of in vitro expanded autologous skeletal muscle derived cells is a new regenerative therapy for stress urinary incontinence. We examined the efficacy and safety of a simpler alternative strategy using freshly harvested, minced autologous skeletal muscle tissue with its inherent content of regenerative cells.A total of 20 and 15 women with uncomplicated and complicated stress urinary incontinence, respectively, received intraurethral injections of minced autologous skeletal muscle tissue and were followed for 1 year. Efficacy was assessed by the number of leakages in a 3-day diary and by ICIQ-SF scores. We calculated the rates of cure, defined as zero leaks in 3 days plus an ICIQ-SF score of 5 or less, and improvement, defined as simultaneous decreases in each outcome measure.Significant reductions were observed in each group in the mean number of leakages (p <0.01) and in ICIQ-SF scores (p <0.001). In the uncomplicated group cure and improvement were observed in 25% and 63% of patients, and in the complicated group they were noted in 7% and 57%, respectively. No voiding dysfunction developed and only minor adverse events were noted.Intraurethral injection of minced autologous muscle tissue is a simple surgical procedure that appears safe and moderately effective in women with uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence. It compares well to a more complicated regenerative strategy using in vitro expanded muscle derived cells.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735937","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.644821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.627169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.550417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.47851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.363159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Breast reduction","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Regenerative medicine","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Mincing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincing"},{"name":"News leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
