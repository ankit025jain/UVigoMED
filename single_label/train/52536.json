{"id":52536,"title":"Transplantation of human menstrual blood stem cells to treat premature ovarian failure in mouse model.","abstract":"The incidence of premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as ovarian insufficiency, has been increasing in recent years. Although some treatments are currently available, improved treatment strategies are urgently required. Many researchers have reported that human endometrial stem cells (HuMenSCs), which exhibit stem/progenitor cell properties in vitro repaired damaged cells in vivo. Thus, we aimed to determine whether HuMenSCs can serve as cell therapy tools and be used for the treatment of POF. After treating with cyclophosphamide, on the first estrus period (we predicted mouse estrus cycle was generally 5 days), HuMenSCs were injected into a cyclophosphamide-induced mouse model of POF. The results revealed that the HuMenSCs could survive within POF mouse ovaries for at least 14 days in vivo; further, ovaries of the HuMenSCs-transplanted group expressed higher levels of ovarian markers [AMH, inhibin ?/?, and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR)], and the proliferative marker Ki67. In addition, the ovarian weight, plasma E2 level, and the number of normal follicles increased over time in the HuMenSC group compared with the control group. Further, microarray analysis of cDNA expression patterns revealed that, after HuMenSC transplantation, the gene mRNA expression patterns in the ovarian cells following stimulation of the host ovarian niche became increasingly similar to those observed in human ovarian tissue compared with the pretransplantation mRNA expression pattern in HuMenSCs. Hence, we can safely conclude that the mesenchymal stem cell properties and in vivo survival of HuMenSCs make them ideal seed cells for stem cell transplantation in the treatment of POF.
