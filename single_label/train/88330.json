{"id":88330,"title":"Open reduction and posterior instrumentation of type 3 high transverse sacral fracture-dislocation: technical note.","abstract":"The authors describe an open reduction and fixation through a posterior approach of Roy-Camille Type 3 transverse sacral fractures. This technique involves posterior staged reduction of the fracture applying distraction forces to restore the height, followed by posterior translation to restore sagittal alignment. Tips and pearls of this procedure, described for the first time in the literature, are also discussed in this report.
