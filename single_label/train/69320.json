{"id":69320,"title":"The CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism and risk of urinary system cancers.","abstract":"The cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) gene plays a key role in the metabolism of various carcinogens. The CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism leads to leucine to valine substitution at codon 432. A lot of studies have shown that the CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism was associated with urinary system cancers, especially prostate cancer. However, the results were still inconclusive. In this meta-analysis, by searching online databases and references of related reviews, we identified 17 eligible studies to assess the relationship between CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism and urinary system cancers, including 7,783 cancer cases and 7,238 controls. By pooling all eligible studies, we found that the CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism was not associated with overall urinary system cancers. However, in subgroup analyses, we found that the variant 432Val allele significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer (Val vs. Leu, odds ratio (OR)?=?1.064, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.981-1.154; Pheterogeneity?=?0.002), while no association was found for bladder cancer (Val vs. Leu, OR?=?0.942, 95% CI 0.853-1.041; Pheterogeneity?=?0.504). No evidence of publication bias was found (Begg's test, P?=?0.053; Egger's test, P?=?0.073). In conclusion, based on 17 eligible studies, we found that the CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, while no association of bladder cancer was observed.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453031","annotations":[{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.861037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Valine","weight":0.798266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.762881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.724906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.496564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.442397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"CYP1B1","weight":0.427489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP1B1"},{"name":"Leucine","weight":0.346556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.219821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
