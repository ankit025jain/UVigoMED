{"id":86543,"title":"Primary undifferentiated carcinoma of the trachea.","abstract":"Primary undifferentiated or lymphoepithelial carcinoma mainly occurs in the nasopharynx. Tracheal localization is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, only four cases have been reported previously, all in Asian patients.A 61-year-old male European patient presented with hemoptysis and cough for several months. The workup revealed a primary tracheal tumor without regional or distant metastasis. The patient was treated with tracheal resection followed by end-to-end reconstruction. Pathologic analysis of the tumor, including immunohistochemistry, confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Testing for Epstein-Barr virus by hybridization in situ was massively positive. With a follow-up at 15 months, the patient is alive and free of disease.We report the first case of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in the trachea in the European population. Treatment possibilities are discussed. They should be based on each patient's clinical presentation and the results of their preoperative workup.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765831","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.879512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.722106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.411192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.374854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nasopharynx","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharynx"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0815024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
