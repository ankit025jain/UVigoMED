{"id":66111,"title":"Biochemical and clinical outcomes after high-dose salvage radiotherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer.","abstract":"To retrospectively evaluate the role of high-dose salvage radiotherapy (SRT) alone with regard to biochemical and clinical outcomes in patients with biochemical failure (BF) after radical prostatectomy (RP).Between January 2003 and August 2011, 168 hormone-na√Øve localized prostate cancer patients received SRT alone for post-RP BF in a single institution and were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent prognostic impact of clinical factors on biochemical and clinical outcomes [biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS)].Median follow-up was 54 months. Actuarial bRFS, cRFS, CSS and OS at 5 years were, respectively, 64, 86.2, 94.5 and 96.3 %. On multivariate analysis, nadir PSA (nPSA) after SRT was significantly associated with bRFS (HR 15, p = 0.001) and cRFS (HR 9, p = 0.001), while CSS was associated with RT dose (?70 Gy; HR 1.9 p = 0.023), pre-RT PSA (<1.5 vs. ?1.5 ng/mL; HR 1.3, p = 0.008) and age (>75 years; HR 1.2, p = 0.05). OS was significantly correlated with pre-SRT PSA (linear correlation; HR 1.1, p = 0.023) and age (<75 vs. ? 75 years; HR 1.1, p = 0.026).Effective biochemical and clinical control rates may be safely achieved administering SRT with high doses (?72 Gy) and using conformal techniques, especially in older patients presenting with lower pre-SRT PSA values. A lower nPSA after SRT predicts for better 5 years bRFS and cRFS rates.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744191","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.664119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.595352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.510248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.344539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.28024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.273831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Catalina Sky Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Sky_Survey"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Conformal map","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Stopping time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_time"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Retinitis pigmentosa","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"}]}
