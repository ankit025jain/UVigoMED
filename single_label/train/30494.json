{"id":30494,"title":"Prescription drug misuse and gender.","abstract":"In recent years, prescription drug misuse has become a serious public health issue. A number of studies in this area have identified females to be at an increased risk for prescription drug misuse during adolescence. Guided by Agnew's general strain theory, the current research examined the relationship between prescription drug misuse and gender during adolescence. We used data from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a sample representative of the non-institutionalized population of the United States. Logistic regression models were estimated to examine the relationship between gender, prescription drug misuse, strain, and depression. The findings indicated that females were at an increased for prescription drug misuse. We also found support for general strain theory, as strain and depression were significantly related to prescription drug misuse. In addition, we found evidence that strain was gendered in that elements of general strain theory accounted for the relationship between prescription drug misuse and gender.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491149","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.715553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.575955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.4191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.271124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Drug misuse","weight":0.0736257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_misuse"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Strain theory (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_theory_(sociology)"}]}
