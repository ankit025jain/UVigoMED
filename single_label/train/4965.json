{"id":4965,"title":"[Analysis of tension-distraction state in the shin bones fractures in conditions of external fixation with application of apparatuses with different spatially oriented supports].","abstract":"In Autodesk Inventor 11 program, using method of end-capping elements, a three- dimensional computeric modelling of biomechanical systems of two models was conducted: I - \"tibia - Ilizarov's apparatus with concentric location of supports\"; II - \"tibia - Ilizarov's apparatus with excentric location of supports\". The loading, which was applied towards distal fragment in 6 standard degrees of freedom, was modelled for studying of the fixation rigidity of tibial fragments in these systems. Determination of the loading value in various directions, in which the fragment have had shifted by 1 mm, have constituted the main task of the investigation. In a model II a rigidity of the fragments fixation, in comparison with such in a model I, is bigger by 631.43% - while applying a compression loading, by 8.35 - 31.75% - the transversal one and by 19.72% - the rotation loading. While choosing the method of transosteal osteosynthesis of the shin bones the advantage, have the apparatuses with excentric location of supports, what secures the enhanced rigidity of the fragments fixation in comparison with such in apparatuses with concentric location of supports. Although, even in excentric location of supports in the apparatus the fixation rigidity is insufficient for early full loading of the traumatized extremity while walking. It is necessary to elaborate such apparatus, the form of which may be adopted toanatomic configuration of segment.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509440","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.643726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.545934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.536637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.32811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Concentric","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Invention","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Autodesk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk"},{"name":"Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Autodesk Inventor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Inventor"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Transversal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Political freedom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
