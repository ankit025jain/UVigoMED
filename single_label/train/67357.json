{"id":67357,"title":"How to diagnose and treat focal therapy failure and recurrence?","abstract":"Focal therapy presents an alternative option for disease-targeted therapy while preserving erectile and urinary function without compromising oncological outcome. Such treatment, which preserves normal prostate parenchyma, presents a clinical challenge to the urologist, as typical disease surveillance parameters are not as reliable in post-ablation follow-up. We propose an integrated approach to post-ablation surveillance to identify treatment failure as well as recurrence.Post-ablation prostate-specific antigen kinetics, imaging based on multiparametric MRI and control biopsies are the tools currently used to follow patients after focal therapy. Good treatment response is indicated by a negative control biopsy, absence of persistent lesion on post-treatment imaging and a reduction in prostate-specific antigen of at least 50%.When histological evidence of therapeutic failure or recurrence is present, different options of management may be proposed to the patient including active surveillance, focal salvage therapy or radical salvage treatment, depending on the characteristics of the lesion found. A recommended post-ablation surveillance protocol is presented as well as a discussion of management strategies based on the data currently available.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625430","annotations":[{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.802861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.692802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Salvage therapy","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.540191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.360144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0533769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
