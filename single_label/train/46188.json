{"id":46188,"title":"Identification of novel transmembrane proteins in scirrhous-type gastric cancer by the Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) method: TM9SF3 participates in tumor invasion and serves as a prognostic factor.","abstract":"Scirrhous-type gastric cancer (GC) is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis due to rapid cancer cell infiltration accompanied by extensive stromal fibrosis. The aim of this study is to identify genes that encode transmembrane proteins frequently expressed in scirrhous-type GC.We compared Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries from 2 human scirrhous-type GC tissues with a normal stomach CAST library. By sequencing 2,880 colonies from scirrhous CAST libraries, we identified a list of candidate genes.We focused on the TM9SF3 gene because it has the highest clone count, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 46 (50%) of 91 GC cases were positive for TM9SF3, which was observed frequently in scirrhous-type GC. TM9SF3 expression showed a significant correlation with the depth of invasion, tumor stage and undifferentiated GC. There was a strong correlation between TM9SF3 expression and poor patient outcome, which was validated in two separate cohorts by immunostaining and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Transient knockdown of the TM9SF3 gene by siRNA showed decreased tumor cell-invasive capacity.Our results indicate that TM9SF3 might be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for scirrhous-type GC.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642718","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.839692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.411536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.2563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
