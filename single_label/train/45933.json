{"id":45933,"title":"Imaging in laparoscopic cholecystectomy--what a radiologist needs to know.","abstract":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment option for cholelithiasis. In order to properly assess for the complications related to the procedure, an understanding of the normal biliary anatomy, its variants and the normal postoperative imaging is essential. Radiologist must be aware of benefits and limitations of multiple imaging modalities in characterizing the complications of this procedure as each of these modalities have a critical role in evaluating a symptomatic post-cholecystectomy patient. The purpose of this article is describe the multi-modality imaging of normal biliary anatomy and its variants, as well as to illustrate the imaging features of biliary, vascular, cystic duct, infectious as well as miscellaneous complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We focus on the information that the radiologist needs to know about the radiographic manifestations of potential complications of this procedure.
