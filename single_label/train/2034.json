{"id":2034,"title":"[Causes of chronic gastrodudenal and bone disorder development in children living under the effect of human induced ecological factors (literature review)].","abstract":"The literature review discloses modern ideas about new etiological factors that that cause gastroduodenitis and bones metabolism dysfunctions in children. The authors cite literature data that give evidence to possible common mechanisms of development of these pathological conditions associated with exposure to man-made factors, such as heavy metals. Metals that have damaging effect on the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract may violate calcium absorption processes in organism, influence on the processes of bone remodeling. At the same time, patterns of chronic gastroduodenitis associated with exposure to unhealthy environmental factors may increase the risk of osteopeny. Knowledge of new pathogenic mechanisms of chronic gastroduodenitis and bones metabolism dysfunctions will allow to provide effective treatment and prevention of comorbidities in children living in ecologically unsafe areas.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518463","annotations":[{"name":"Heavy metal (chemistry)","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.489441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.419367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.323229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0898588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Calcium metabolism","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_metabolism"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"}]}
