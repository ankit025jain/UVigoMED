{"id":40084,"title":"The antioxidant effect of Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea in rat colitis model induced by acetic acid.","abstract":"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon, and reactive oxidative metabolites (ROMs) play an important role in its pathogenesis. Alternative therapies such as herbal remedies are increasingly being used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis for better clinical outcome of ulcerative colitis and less adverse effects. Echinacea has many features including antioxidant and wound-healing properties. Hence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of Echinacea spp. on experimental colitis model induced by acetic acid in Wistar albino rats.Acute colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of acetic acid. Rats were divided into four groups, namely control, Echinacea-administered, Echinacea-administered-colitis and colitis. Malondialdehyde and total antioxidant status were assayed in tissue samples. Histopathological evaluation was also performed.Macroscopic and microscopic scores were significantly higher in colitis group compared to control, Echinacea and Echinacea-colitis groups (p < 0.001). There was no significant differences in respect of macroscopic and microscopic scores between control, Echinacea and Echinacea-colitis groups (p > 0.3, p > 0.22). Malondialdehyde levels were elevated in colitis group compared to other groups (p < 0.001). Total antioxidant status was significantly higher in Echinacea group compared with other groups and also significantly higher in Echinacea-colitis group compared with colitis group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).Echinacea may possibly have some therapeutic usefulness in the management of ulcerative colitis (Tab. 2, Fig. 4, Ref. 35).","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25077363","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.686821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.652683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.598976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.534572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.426739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Echinacea","weight":0.385993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinacea"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.244741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
