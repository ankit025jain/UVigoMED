{"id":24163,"title":"Nonpuerperal mastitis and subareolar abscess of the breast.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to show radiologists how to readily recognize nonpuerperal subareolar abscess and its complications in order to help reduce the time to definitive therapy and improve patient care. To achieve this purpose, the various theories of pathogenesis and the associated histopathologic features are reviewed; the typical clinical characteristics are detailed in contrast to those seen in lactational abscess and inflammatory breast cancer; the common imaging findings are described with emphasis on the sonographic features; correlative pathologic findings are presented to reinforce the imaging findings as they pertain to disease origins; and the various treatment options are reviewed.Nonpuerperal subareolar mastitis and abscess is a benign breast entity often associated with prolonged morbidity. Through better understanding of the underlying disease process the imaging, physical, and clinical findings of this rare process can be more readily recognized and treatment options expedited, improving patient care.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450694","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.680803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.636702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.597221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.571019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Areola","weight":0.298455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areola"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Inflammatory breast cancer","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Nonpuerperal mastitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpuerperal_mastitis"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
