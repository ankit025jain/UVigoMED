{"id":19375,"title":"Functional characterization of the type III secretion ATPase SsaN encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2.","abstract":"A type III secretion system (T3SS) is utilized by a large number of gram-negative bacteria to deliver effectors directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. One essential component of a T3SS is an ATPase that catalyzes the unfolding of proteins, which is followed by the translocation of effectors through an injectisome. Here we demonstrate a functional role of the ATPase SsaN, a component of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 T3SS (T3SS-2) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. SsaN hydrolyzed ATP in vitro and was essential for T3SS function and Salmonella virulence in vivo. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that SsaN interacted with SsaK and SsaQ to form the C ring complex. SsaN and its complex co-localized to the membrane fraction under T3SS-2 inducing conditions. In addition, SsaN bound to Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) specific chaperones, including SsaE, SseA, SscA, and SscB that facilitated translocator/effector secretion. Using an in vitro chaperone release assay, we demonstrated that SsaN dissociated a chaperone-effector complex, SsaE and SseB, in an ATP-dependent manner. Effector release was dependent on a conserved arginine residue at position 192 of SsaN, and this was essential for its enzymatic activity. These results strongly suggest that the T3SS-2-associated ATPase SsaN contributes to T3SS-2 effector translocation efficiency.
