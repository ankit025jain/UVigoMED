{"id":83710,"title":"Physical activity during pregnancy and offspring characteristics at 8-10 years.","abstract":"We evaluated relationships between mothers' physical activity (PA) during pregnancy and child blood pressure, aerobic fitness, and birth weight.Anthropometrics, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, and aerobic fitness were measured on 20 mother/child pairs, 8-10 years postpartum. Pregnancy PA (kJ/kg.wk) was calculated from historical recall. Women were classified as meeting, or not meeting ACOG PA recommendations.Twelve women met ACOG recommendations, and their children had significantly lower birth weights (3.51±0.45 kg) than the more sedentary women (4.05±0.67 kg). Third trimester maternal PA was inversely related to child SBP (rs=-0.46, P=0.04) but not aerobic fitness. Birth weight was inversely related to SBP (rs=-0.75, P=0.03) if mothers did not meet PA recommendations.Results from our preliminary study suggest that maternal PA is associated with an alteration in the relationship between birth weight and SBP.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270788","annotations":[{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.509679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.429685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.225277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"Weight training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 67 kg","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_-_Women's_67_kg"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Third World","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Recall (memory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"Schlaich Bergermann & Partner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlaich_Bergermann_&_Partner"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Blood Pressures","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Pressures"}]}
