{"id":71519,"title":"ECM stiffness regulates glial migration in Drosophila and mammalian glioma models.","abstract":"Cell migration is an important feature of glial cells. Here, we used the Drosophila eye disc to decipher the molecular network controlling glial migration. We stimulated glial motility by pan-glial PDGF receptor (PVR) activation and identified several genes acting downstream of PVR. Drosophila lox is a non-essential gene encoding a secreted protein that stiffens the extracellular matrix (ECM). Glial-specific knockdown of Integrin results in ECM softening. Moreover, we show that lox expression is regulated by Integrin signaling and vice versa, suggesting that a positive-feedback loop ensures a rigid ECM in the vicinity of migrating cells. The general implication of this model was tested in a mammalian glioma model, where a Lox-specific inhibitor unraveled a clear impact of ECM rigidity in glioma cell migration.
