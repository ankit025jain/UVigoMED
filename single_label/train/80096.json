{"id":80096,"title":"[Long-term therapeutic effect of Ruangan pills on advanced schistosomiasis patients with ascites].","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term therapeutic effect of Ruangan pills on advanced schistosomiasis combined with ascites.The data of 54 advanced schistosomiasis patients with ascites were collected, and the patients were divided into two groups namely a treatment group and a control group according to whether taking Ruangan pills. The effective rates, improvement status of symptoms and levels of serum albumin (ALB) and hyaluronic acid (HA) of the two groups were compared.The effective rates of the treatment group and control group were 92.59% and 44.44%, respectively, and the difference between them was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After the treatment for 9 and 12 months, the percentages of patients without ascites and patients with symptom improvement in the treatment group were 77.78% and 92.59%, 92.59% and 96.30%, respectively, while those in the control group were 29.63% and 37.00%, 48.15% and 51.85%, respectively, and the differences between the two groups by different time were all statistical significant (all P < 0.05). After the treatment for 9 months, the percentages of patients with the normal levels of ALB and HA were 88.89% and 59.26%, while those in the control group were 40.74% and 14.81%, respectively, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (both P < 0.05).The long-term treatment of Ruangan pills can not only improve clinical symptoms but also control the ascites recurrence, however, the therapeutic effect and the recurrence rate of ascites in longer-term still need further observation.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800584","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.763571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.509337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.227124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Pill (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
