{"id":79477,"title":"Specific allergen immunotherapy use in 2012: an Irish Paediatric Surveillance Unit (IPSU) study.","abstract":"Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a disease modifying treatment for allergic rhinitis (AR), with its benefits most evident in those who are refractory to medical treatment. It is used less frequently in UK than Europe/US. No data exist on SIT use in Ireland. We audited paediatric practice to evaluate patient selection, SIT modalities and adverse events (A.E.). A 9 item questionnaire was sent to Irish paediatricians, identified via the Irish Paediatric Surveillance Unit (IPSU) mailing list. 58 children have undertaken SIT (Subcutaneous SCIT =3, Sublingual = 55). This represents 0.01% of Irish children estimated to have AR. 33 (56%) had asthma; 18 (55%) had perennial asthma, 7 (21%) seasonal asthma. Adverse events occurred in 5 cases (8.6%). Three treatments (3-5%) were discontinued as a result. SIT is available across Ireland, though only extremely small numbers of children with AR are being treated yet. Co-morbid asthma is frequent and does not increase adverse events. This audit will raise awareness of SIT use for AR in Ireland.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24416855","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.826641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.729817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.497399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.428094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.319198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Allergen immunotherapy","weight":0.105598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.0870413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Perennial plant","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
