{"id":65440,"title":"Resistin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and human semen parameters in the presence of leukocytospermia, smoking habit, and varicocele.","abstract":"To explore the relationships between resistin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and semen parameters, sperm apoptosis, and necrosis in infertile patients and in control subjects with unknown reproductive potential with/without smoking habits, leukocytospermia, and varicocele.Prospective study.Sperm laboratory.A total of 110 selected men.Family history, clinical/physical examination, ELISA determination (resistin, IL-6, TNF-?), semen analysis, annexin V/propidium iodide assay.Relationships among resistin, IL-6, and TNF-? and semen parameters in the presence of smoking habits, varicocele, leukocytospermia, and in infertile subjects.Resistin level was higher in semen than in serum. Resistin semen levels showed negative correlations with sperm motility and positive correlations with apoptotic, necrotic sperm and TNF-? and IL-6 levels. Resistin, TNF-?, and IL-6 levels were higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers and in cases with leukocytospermia, in which an increase in necrotic sperm and a decrease in the number of sperm with normal morphology and motility were observed. Cytokine levels were significantly higher in infertile patients compared with control subjects with unknown reproductive potential. A total of 74.5% of infertile patients showed leukocytospermia.Semen resistin correlated with IL-6, TNF-?, and sperm quality; in cases of leukocytospermia and smoking habits, resistin concentrations were increased, suggesting that resistin may play a regulatory role in inflammation of the male reproductive system.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830311","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Reproductive system","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.684639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.601689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.528507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.467634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.387111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.359066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Male reproductive system (human)","weight":0.337453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_reproductive_system_(human)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.252428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Sperm motility","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_motility"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.174016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.155452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
