{"id":50855,"title":"[Incidence of proapoptotic proteins p53 and p21 in epithelial ovarian tumors].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of proapoptotic proteins p53 and p21 in cystadenomas, borderline tumors and ovarian cancers. The correlation between proapoptotic proteins and selected parameters of ovarian tumors was also assessed.The study group consisted of 66 patients operated on because of epithelial ovarian tumor The study group was further divided into three subgroups: cystadenomas, borderline tumors and ovarian cancers.The average value of p53 was the highest in the ovarian cancer group (50.12 +/- 39.52), whereas average value for p21 was the highest in patients with borderline tumors (24.41 +/- 24.43). There was a negative correlation between tumor stage and parameters of p21(+++), p21(++), p271 (+) but no correlation was found between the expression of p53, p21 and histological type of ovarian cancer.The assessment of p53 and p21 can be expensive, but it proves to be a useful tool in difficult cases. Positive reaction to p53 can be noted in both, benign and malignant ovarian tumors, but in case of cancer its intensity is notably stronger.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745156","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
