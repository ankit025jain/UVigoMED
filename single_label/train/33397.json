{"id":33397,"title":"Augmentation of craniofacial defects using alloplastic material.","abstract":"Alloplastic materials are increasingly being used in augmentation of craniofacial defects because of its ready availability, good aesthetic outcome and absence of donor site morbidity. This paper highlights experience in the use of heat-cured acrylic in augmentation cranioplasty.The management of three patients with anterior skull defect who presented at the Dental and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital over a five-year period is presented.There was good aesthetic outcome in all the patients and no complications were recorded.Augmentation of craniofacial defects using customized prefabricated heat-cured acrylic provides patients with a durable, stable and structural repair of craniofacial defects with good aesthetic outcome.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831907","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.354654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.194581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.160705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Kano","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano"},{"name":"Cranioplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranioplasty"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Augmentation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_(music)"},{"name":"Aminu Kano","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminu_Kano"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prefabrication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefabrication"}]}
