{"id":82840,"title":"Hand, foot and mouth disease--outbreak in Romania?","abstract":"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a viral illness usually occurring during the summer months in children younger than 5 years of age. In the North-East area of Romania the incidence is usually low, each dermatologist reporting 1-2 cases or even less per year. The diagnosis is usually based on the characteristic clinical aspect: vesicles and papules on the hands and feet and superficial oral ulcers. HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease that resolves in approximately 7 days; in Asia there have been few reported severe cases that developed neurological complications and even death, while in certain areas of China this disease is a more and more serious public health problem. In the summer of 2012 in North-East Romania numerous cases of disease have been reported, some with atypical clinical manifestations and most of them with mild or moderate forms of disease. The present article is a discussion on one of these cases. The diagnosis was made based on lesions location and clinical appearance. An outbreak of HFMD should be confirmed by virology tests.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505914","annotations":[{"name":"Virology","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.621716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Hand, foot and mouth disease","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand,_foot_and_mouth_disease"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.521335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.491877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.473233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.221945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.13498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"}]}
