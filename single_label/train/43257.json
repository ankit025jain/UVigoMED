{"id":43257,"title":"Rsf-1 overexpression serves as a prognostic marker in human hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Rsf-1 (HBXAP) was recently reported to be overexpressed in various cancers and associated with the malignant behavior of cancer cells. However, the expression of Rsf-1 and its clinical significance in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been reported. In the present study, we analyzed the expression pattern of Rsf-1 in human HCC tissues and found that Rsf-1 was overexpressed in 41.1 % of HCC specimens. There was a significant association between Rsf-1 overexpression and tumor stage (p?=?0.0322), AFP (p?=?0.0184), and tumor relapse (p?=?0.0112). Furthermore, Rsf-1 overexpression correlated with poor overall survival in HCC patients (p?<?0.001). Rsf-1 overexpression could serve as an independent predictor for poor recurrence-free survival (p?=?0.0079). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in SK-Hep-1 cells with high endogenous Rsf-1 expression inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, with downregulation of cyclin E protein. In conclusion, Rsf-1 is overexpressed in HCCs and serves as a novel tumor marker. Rsf-1 contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth through regulation of cell cycle proteins.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798976","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Cyclin E","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_E"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.481749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.475373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.416132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.413135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.395642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.274966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
