{"id":55861,"title":"The lateral canthus web and its surgical management.","abstract":"The lateral canthus is structurally important for normal eyelid contour and for reconstruction of the periorbital region. An abnormal lateral canthus contour has significant implications regarding lateral visual field and affects periocular cosmesis.To describe of a series of patients with dehiscence of the lateral canthus and the surgical approach of treatment.Four cases with primary lateral canthal web that were seen by the same surgeon between 2005 and 2012. The average age was 69.7 years, (range 52-81 years), one male and three females. Primary complaints were lateral visual field constriction, tired eyes, and abnormal eyelids. In 3 cases, reconstruction of the lateral canthus was performed using periosteal flaps.Reconstruction of the lateral canthus with periosteal flaps yielded a satisfactory result in cases of lateral canthus web. Additional cases would enhance our understanding of this pathology.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793511","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.154061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Cosmesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmesis"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0289305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Canthus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canthus"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Visual arts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
