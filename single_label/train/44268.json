{"id":44268,"title":"[Long-term survival in a case of recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with intermittent or low-dose imatinib].","abstract":"A 65-year-old woman with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST)underwent a total gastrectomy in 1999. In 2004, she was diagnosed with an intra-abdominal recurrence and was treated with 300mg/day of imatinib. Because of the side effects of imatinib, we interrupted the treatment and were forced to reduce the dose from 300mg/day to 100mg/day. However, at present, the tumor remains controlled. In conclusion, this case suggested that, even if given irregularly or at a low-dose, continuous treatment with imatinib might contribute to long-term survival in patients with GIST.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743288","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.824131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.585087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor","weight":0.547549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.524287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.329832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.269459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.242222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
