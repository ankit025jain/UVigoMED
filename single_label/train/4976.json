{"id":4976,"title":"[Advances on internal fixation treatment for femoral neck fracture in elderly patients].","abstract":"Compared with hip replacement, internal fixation in the treatment of the elderly femoral neck fracture, especially the application of cannulated screws, is minimally invasive, easy to operate and economical. In recent years, it becomes the research focus in the field of orthopedic clinical research. However, configuration of cannulated screws is still controversial. Most clinicians believe that three cannulated screws being placed in parallel in an inverted triangle configuration is better than that in a triangular configuration in biomechanics and clinical effect. Nonparallel strong oblique nailing technique allows the screws to share more weight to reduce postoperative complications, so that it is more suitable for elderly patients with osteoporosis. However, the related complications of internal fixation such as nonunion, femoral neck shortening and other problems are still the focus of domestic and foreign scholars. Issues about how to control the indication of internal fixation surgery, understand related factors of the complications, and prevent complications are required to be further explored.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464602","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.772608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.579468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.467821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.347254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.244841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Triangle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Issues (Korn album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_(Korn_album)"},{"name":"Scholarly method","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_method"}]}
