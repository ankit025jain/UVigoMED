{"id":82963,"title":"A case of imperforate Wharton duct.","abstract":"Congenital oral masses are rare entities. The establishment of formal fetal diagnostic teams has led to an increased antenatal detection of such lesions. The congenital ranula is a distinct entity from the more familiar variant presenting later in life. The congenital variant may result from an anomaly of the Wharton duct with subsequent dilation of the duct. The variant presenting later in life is the more familiar mucous extravasation phenomenon in the floor of the mouth. Management of the congenital ranula is distinct from its noncongenital counterpart and more conservative and is discussed in the present report.
