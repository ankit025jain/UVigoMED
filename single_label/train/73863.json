{"id":73863,"title":"Misperception of estrogen activity in patients treated with an estrogen receptor antagonist.","abstract":"Measurement of estradiol is an important marker of ovarian function. At low levels, accurate measurement has been difficult because of unique characteristics of immunoassay kits. We present this case to emphasize the importance of accurate estimation of estrogen activity and estradiol levels to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.
