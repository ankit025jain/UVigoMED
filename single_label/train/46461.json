{"id":46461,"title":"Anti-ulcerogenic activity and isolation of the active principles from Sambucus ebulus L. leaves.","abstract":"Sambucus ebulus L. has a very prominent place in Turkish folk medicine. Leaves of the plant are practiced externally to relieve rheumatic pain, to treat abscess, for wound healing and internally against hemorrhoids and stomachache. In a previous work, aqueous extract of the leaves was shown to possess potent antiulcerogenic activity on water immersion and immobilization-induced stress ulcer model in rats. This study aims to investigate the antiulcerogenic activity profile of the plant on various in vivo peptic ulcer models and gastric biochemical parameters and through bioassay-guided processing to isolate the active constituent (s) and to elucidate its structure.Among the subextracts obtained by successive solvent extractions from the MeOH extract of the leaves, the butanol subextract exerted significant antiulcerogenic activity against water-immersion and immobilization-induced stress ulcer model in rats as the bioassay model. This subextract was then subjected to successive chemical separation techniques (precipitation, column chromatography based on ion-exchange, silica gel and sephadex) and the activity of each fraction/subfraction was tested using the same bioassay model. After determination of active principles, further studies were performed on the active subextract by using various in vivo test models (ethanol-, serotonin-, pyloric ligation-induced ulcerogenesis) in rats as well as biochemical methods for the evaluation of antiulcerogenic potential.Bioassay-guided fractionation procedures yielded two flavonol glycosides as the active antiulcerogenic principles. The structures of these compounds were elucidated as isorhamnetin-3-O-monoglycoside and quercetin-3-O-monoglycoside by using (1)H, (13)C-NMR, and FAB-MS techniques.This study has proven the folkloric use of Sambucus ebulus leaves for the treatment of gastric ailments in Turkish folk medicine. The antiulcerogenic activity of the two flavonol glycosides isolated in the present study was not previously reported elsewhere.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System
