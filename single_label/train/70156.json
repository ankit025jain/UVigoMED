{"id":70156,"title":"Development and evaluation of the Cancer Dyads Group Intervention: preliminary findings.","abstract":"Despite the fact that importance of primary relationships for cancer patients and their caregivers' adaptation to illness is well recognized, only a paucity of studies report about clinical interventions for the patient-caregiver dyad. The article presents the Cancer Dyads Group Intervention (CDGI), a supportive group intervention for breast cancer patients and caregivers, and preliminary findings about its effectiveness. A correspondence analysis of the verbatim transcripts of the first three groups was conducted. Findings highlight the evolution of participants during the intervention and confirm the congruence between goals and the participants' experience. Further investigation of the CDGI effectiveness is necessary.
