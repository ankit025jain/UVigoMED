{"id":33307,"title":"Healthcare transition for youth with heart disease: a clinical trial.","abstract":"Adolescents with heart disease have complex health needs and require lifelong cardiology follow-up. Interventions to facilitate paediatric to adult healthcare transition are recommended, although outcomes are unknown. We sought to determine the impact of a transition intervention on improving knowledge and self-management skills among this population.We conducted a clinical trial of 15-17?year olds with moderate or complex congenital heart disease (CHD) or cardiomyopathy. Participants were systematically allocated to either usual care (controls) or a 1 h nurse-led one-on-one teaching session about their heart. Allocation was determined by week of attendance in the cardiology clinic. The primary outcome was change in Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) score at 6?months, possible scores ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (optimal). Cardiac knowledge (MyHeart score, range 0-100) was a secondary outcome. Analysis was intention to treat.Of 58 participants (48% female), 52 had CHD and 6 had cardiomyopathy. 27 were allocated to the intervention group; 3 declined the intervention and received usual care. When comparing the intervention group with the usual care group at 6?months postintervention, the mean self-management TRAQ score was 3.59 (±0.83) vs. 3.16 (±1.05), respectively (p=0.048, adjusted for baseline score); the mean self-advocacy TRAQ score was 4.38 (±0.56) vs. 4.01 (±0.95) (p=0.18) and the mean MyHeart score was 75% (±15) vs. 61% (±25) (p=0.019).A 1 h nurse-led transition intervention resulted in a significant improvement in self-management and cardiac knowledge scores. An educational intervention should be routine for youth with congenital or acquired heart disease.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842870","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.81272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.720804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.47189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Intention to treat analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_to_treat_analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1517","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1517"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_1"},{"name":"The Avengers (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"},{"name":"Uncial 0100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0100"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
