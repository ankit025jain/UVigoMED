{"id":37286,"title":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome: further delineation of phenotype, cohesin biology and educational focus, 5th Biennial Scientific and Educational Symposium abstracts.","abstract":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is the prototype for the cohesinopathy disorders that have mutations in genes associated with the cohesin subunit in all cells. Roberts syndrome is the next most common cohesinopathy. In addition to the developmental implications of cohesin biology, there is much translational and basic research, with progress towards potential treatment for these conditions. Clinically, there are many issues in CdLS faced by the individual, parents and caretakers, professionals, and schools. The following abstracts are presentations from the 5th Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Scientific and Educational Symposium on June 20-21, 2012, in conjunction with the Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation National Meeting, Lincolnshire, IL. The research committee of the CdLS Foundation organizes the meeting, reviews and accepts abstracts and subsequently disseminates the information to the families. In addition to the basic science and clinical discussions, there were educationally-focused talks related to practical aspects of management at home and in school. AMA CME credits were provided by Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Baltimore, MD.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504889","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.839625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.569015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.370077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Baltimore","weight":0.280064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore"},{"name":"Pure research","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_research"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fundamental science","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_science"},{"name":"Academic conference","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Lincolnshire, Illinois","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire,_Illinois"},{"name":"Cohesin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesin"},{"name":"Greater Baltimore Medical Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Baltimore_Medical_Center"},{"name":"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_de_Lange_Syndrome"},{"name":"Roberts syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_syndrome"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lincolnshire","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire"},{"name":"Abstract (summary)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)"},{"name":"2021","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Symposium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium"},{"name":"Continuing medical education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_medical_education"},{"name":"American Medical Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association"},{"name":"Baltimore metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
