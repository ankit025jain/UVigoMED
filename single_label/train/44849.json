{"id":44849,"title":"Sugars, sucrose and colorectal cancer risk: the Fukuoka colorectal cancer study.","abstract":"A diet high in sugars may promote colorectal carcinogenesis, but it remains uncertain whether high intake of sugars or sucrose confers increased risk of colorectal cancer. The authors investigated the associations of sugars and sucrose intake with colorectal cancer risk in a community-based case-control study in Japan.The study subjects comprised 816 incident cases of colorectal cancer and 815 community controls. Consumption frequencies and portion sizes of 148 food and beverage items were ascertained by a computer-assisted interview. The authors used the consumption of 29 food items to estimate sugars and sucrose intake. The odds ratios of colorectal cancer risk according to intake categories were obtained using a logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounding variables.Overall, intakes of sugars and sucrose were not related to colorectal cancer risk either in men or women. The association between sugars intake and colorectal cancer risk differed by smoking status and alcohol use in men, but not in women. In men, sugars intake tended to be associated with colorectal cancer risk inversely among never-smokers and positively among male ever-smokers (interaction p=0.01). Sugars intake was associated with an increased risk among men with no alcohol consumption, but was unrelated to the risk among male alcohol drinkers (interaction p=0.02). Body mass index did not modify the association with sugars intake in either men or women.Sugars intake was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer among smokers and non-alcohol drinkers in men selectively.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716480","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.912986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.727589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.66003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.539577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.518819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.498387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.118004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Fukuoka","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
