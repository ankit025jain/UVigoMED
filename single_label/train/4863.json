{"id":4863,"title":"CD4+ T cell help guides formation of CD103+ lung-resident memory CD8+ T cells during influenza viral infection.","abstract":"Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells provide enhanced protection against infection at mucosal sites. Here we found that CD4(+) T cells are important for the formation of functional lung-resident CD8(+) T cells after influenza virus infection. In the absence of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells displayed reduced expression of CD103 (Itgae), were mislocalized away from airway epithelia, and demonstrated an impaired ability to recruit CD8(+) T cells to the lung airways upon heterosubtypic challenge. CD4(+) T cell-derived interferon-? was necessary for generating lung-resident CD103(+) CD8(+) Trm cells. Furthermore, expression of the transcription factor T-bet was increased in \"unhelped\" lung Trm cells, and a reduction in T-bet rescued CD103 expression in the absence of CD4(+) T cell help. Thus, CD4(+) T cell-dependent signals are important to limit expression of T-bet and allow for the development of CD103(+) CD8(+) Trm cells in the lung airways following respiratory infection.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308332","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.821942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.385564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Respiratory epithelium","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_epithelium"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0775986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"ITGAE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITGAE"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
