{"id":30286,"title":"Enhancement of drug-specific lymphocyte proliferation using CD25(hi)-depleted CD3(+) effector cells.","abstract":"The lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) is used for in vitro diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity reactions. While its specificity is over 90%, sensitivity is limited and depends on the type of reaction, drug and possibly time interval between the event and analysis. Removal of regulatory T cells (Treg/CD25(hi)) from in vitro stimulated cell cultures was previously reported to be a promising method to increase the sensitivity of proliferation tests.The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the effect of removal of regulatory T cells on the sensitivity of the LTT.Patients with well-documented drug hypersensitivity were recruited. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, isolated CD3(+) and CD3(+) T cells depleted of the CD25(hi) fraction were used as effector cells in the LTT. Irrelevant drugs were also included to determine specificity. (3)H-thymidine incorporation was utilized as the detection system and results were expressed as a stimulation index (SI).SIs of 7/11 LTTs were reduced after a mean time interval of 10.5 months (LTT 1 vs. LTT 2). Removal of the CD25(hi) fraction, which was FOXP3(+) and had a suppressive effect on drug-induced proliferation, resulted in an increased response to the relevant drugs. Sensitivity was increased from 25 to 82.35% with dramatically enhanced SI (2.05 to 6.02). Specificity was not affected.Removal of Treg/CD25(hi) cells can increase the frequency and strengths of drug-specific proliferation without affecting specificity. This approach might be useful in certain drug hypersensitivity reactions with borderline responses or long time interval since the hypersensitivity reaction.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525750","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.86647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.739099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.601573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.320366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.0961346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
