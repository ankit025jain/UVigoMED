{"id":50810,"title":"[Role of intra-abdominal hypertension in the development and outcome of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome].","abstract":"To evaluate the role of intraabdominal hypertension in the development and outcome of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.60 patients with varying degrees of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) due to ongoing pregnancy were involved in the study. Intraabdominal pressure (IAP) was measured in the bladder. Performance of abdominal perfusion pressure, filtration gradient, extensibility and compliance of the anterior abdominal wall were evaluated. A size of the ovaries, chorionic condition and ascites were determined by ultrasonic method. Relation of pregnancy outcome and IAP was analyzed.The mean value of IAP in patients with light form of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was 7.05 +/- 1.76 mm Hg, 13.65 +/- 1.92 mm Hg in patients with moderate form, and 20.60 +/- 2.52 mm Hg in patients with severe form of OHSS. The leading factors in the development and progression of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) are the volume of the ovaries, ascites, and extensibility of the abdominal wall. The comparison of pregnancy outcome and severity of IAP revealed a strong positive correlation--r = 0.726, p < 0.001.Evaluation of the severity of intra-abdominal hypertension in patients with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with considering the clinical data and results of laboratory and instrumental studies allow clarifying the severity of condition and predict the potential complications and pregnancy outcomes.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749264","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.664488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.56292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.353195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.353107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.317693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.121805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Instrumental","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental"},{"name":"726","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/726"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Extensibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"George Bush Intercontinental Airport","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
