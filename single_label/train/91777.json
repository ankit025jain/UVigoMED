{"id":91777,"title":"Role of gentian violet paint in burn wound management: a prospective randomised control trial.","abstract":"In tribal part of central India burn remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Burn management is carried out in conventional manner in most places. The study carried out at Chhatisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur was Intended to evaluate the efficacy and outcome of 0.5% gentian violet paint local application over conventional dressing treatment of burn wound. The study encompasses 400 patients of burn of varied aetiology admitted in burn ward whose total body surface area of burn was 15% to 50%. The patients receiving conventional treatment were in group I (n=200), and those with gentian violet paint local application formed group II (n= 200). Although, fibrosis of the burn wound, hypertrophic scar were slightly higher in second group it was observed gentian violet paint local application, healed it in 6-8 weeks without severe sepsis and need for skin grafting. From the study it can be concluded that markedly inexpensive gentian violet paint is an useful alternative, for burn wound management.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475556","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.608356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"India","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.520555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.43514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.39073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Chhattisgarh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh"},{"name":"Gentiana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentiana"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"Hypertrophic scar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_scar"},{"name":"Crystal violet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_violet"},{"name":"Total body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_body_surface_area"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Violet (color)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(color)"},{"name":"Tribe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Major (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)"},{"name":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Medical_Sciences,_Banaras_Hindu_University"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Paint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint"},{"name":"Central India Agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_India_Agency"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
