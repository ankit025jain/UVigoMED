{"id":21394,"title":"[Influence of therapy with interferon inducer on the parameters of quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis].","abstract":"The evaluation of quality of life using a questionnaire--Version 2 of the \"SF-36 Health Survey\" was performed in 144 patients with widespread pulmonary tuberculosis. The low level of \"quality of life\" was revealed in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in comparison with healthy persons. It is caused by limiting physical activity, reducing the psychological component due to low vitality and mental health. By the end of the second month of chemotherapy, the changes are saved (PE, RP) and even exacerbated (RE, MN) in patients with MDR MBT. Combined therapy with Cycloferon improves physical activity of patients without MDR MBT. In this case, the mental health of the patient is perceived positively due to increasing the emotional activity, more expressed in patients without MDR MBT and minimization emotional problems related to the disease in patients with MDR MBT.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605618","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.80712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.751453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.396462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.346584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.130256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Religious education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_education"},{"name":"Main battle tank","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank"},{"name":"Role-playing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
