{"id":25730,"title":"[Pulse wave velocity and pulse pressure in patients with arterial hypertension].","abstract":"The article is devoted to assessment of pulse pressure (PP) in female postmenopausal patients and patients with arterial hypertension (AH) older than 55 years. It is shown that in postmenopausal women even aged 55 years or less PP is one of most important parameters associated with target organ damage. Conclusion about presence of elevated vascular wall stiffness in these women as in elderly patients can be made at PP more or equal 60 mm Hg. In elderly patients both with isolated systolic AP and 1-2 degree systolic-diastolic monotherapy with indapamide 1,5 mg retard allows not only to achieve clear-cut hypotensive effect but in both variants of AH to lower PP. This can substantially decrease degree of cardiovascular risk without crossing bottom borders of diastolic AP lowering. The latter is especially important for elderly patients with isolated systolic AH.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177885","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.695962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Pulse pressure","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_pressure"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.594507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.330791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.327927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Indapamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indapamide"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"}]}
