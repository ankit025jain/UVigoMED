{"id":10292,"title":"Silibinin attenuates MPP?-induced neurotoxicity in the substantia nigra in vivo.","abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) pathway. The cause of neuronal death in PD is largely unknown, but it is becoming clear that inflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PD. Silibinin is a major flavonoid in milk thistle which has an anti-inflammatory activity. We investigated whether silibinin could have neuroprotective effects on DA neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-treated animal model of PD in vivo. To address this question, animals received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections 10, 50, or 100?mg/kg of silibinin, starting 1 day before MPP(+) injection and continued daily until 6 days post-lesion for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining, or until 1 hour prior to the MPP(+) injection to examine the expression levels of inflammatory proteins. Finally, their brains were harvested at the indicated time points for the analyses. Silibinin treatment with 10?mg/kg had no significantly neuroprotective effects in the substantia nigra (SN). However, 50 and 100?mg/kg of silibinin ameliorated the MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity in the SN in a dose-dependent manner, and the increased levels of inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by MPP(+) treatment were attenuated by treatment with 100?mg/kg of silibinin. These results indicate that silibinin could be a useful and beneficial natural product offering promise for the prevention of DA neuronal degeneration involved in PD.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660866","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric
