{"id":9246,"title":"Effects of the Pringle manoeuvre on the healing of left colonic anastomoses in rats.","abstract":"Whether to perform colorectal cancer and liver metastasis resections simultaneously or in separate procedures is controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the Pringle manoeuvre on the healing of left-sided colonic anastomoses in rats.Sixteen rats were randomly separated into two groups. In Groups 1 and 2, 1 cm of descending colon was resected and a primary anastomosis was performed. In Group 2, an intermittent pedicle clamp (the Pringle manoeuvre) was performed. On postoperative day 5, laparotomy was performed and the bursting pressures of all colon anastomoses were determined. Tissues were sampled for assay of hydroxyproline levels. Cultures of intraperitoneal swabs were also performed.Clostridium was twice as abundant in the Pringle manoeuvre group as in the control group (p < 0.05). Anastomosis-bursting pressures and tissue hydroxyproline levels were significantly lower in the Pringle manoeuvre group than in the control group (p < 0.05).The Pringle manoeuvre may compromise the viability of colonic anastomoses.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720141","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.894125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Descending colon","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_colon"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.730883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.204307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pringle manoeuvre","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringle_manoeuvre"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Hydroxyproline","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyproline"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Clamp (tool)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_(tool)"},{"name":"No. 1 Group RAF","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Group_RAF"},{"name":"Bursting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursting"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"}]}
