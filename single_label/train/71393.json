{"id":71393,"title":"Tumor regression by CD4 T-cells primed with dendritic/tumor fusion cell vaccines.","abstract":"Vaccination with fusions of dendritic cells (DCs) and mucin-1 (MUC1)-positive tumor cells (FC/MUC1) induces MUC1-specific antitumor immunity. However, little is known about the function of Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4 T-cells primed with FC/MUC1 in MUC1 transgenic (MUC1.Tg) mice.CD4 T-cells primed with FC/MUC1 were analyzed by flow cytometry. Antitumor immunity by adoptive transfer of primed CD4 T-cells in Rag2(-/-) mice was assessed.The effector and memory T-cells generated with FC/MUC1 were crucial to maintenance of long-term antitumor immunity. MUC1-8-mer peptide SAPDTRPA presented by FC/MUC1 was recognized by CD4 and CD8 T-cells. A subset of primed CD4 T-cells possessed cytotoxicity to lyse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MUC1 positive tumor cells. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of primed CD4 T-cells prevented lung metastasis in Rag2(-/-) mice.CD4 T-cells primed by FC/MUC1 play direct role in antitumor immunity.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075013","annotations":[{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cluster of differentiation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_of_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.163139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"}]}
