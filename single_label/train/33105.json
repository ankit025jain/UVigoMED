{"id":33105,"title":"Percutaneous sclerotherapy of foot venous malformations: evaluation of clinical response.","abstract":"To evaluate a single institutional experience with percutaneous sclerotherapy of venous malformations (VM) of the foot.Sixteen patients (mean age 14.6 years; range 6-27.3 years), who underwent 34 sclerotherapy procedures were retrospectively analysed. Technical success, Puig classification, VM size reduction, and the complication rate were evaluated. In procedures in which C-arm computed tomography (CT) was performed, the VM-to-skin surface distance was measured. Additionally, an e-mail-based questionnaire to evaluate the response to sclerotherapy was answered by the patients.Technical success was 97%. The mean number of procedures per patient was 2.1 (range 1-5). In all procedures, sodium tetradecyl sulphate foam was used. Appropriate follow-up was available for 29/33 procedures (88%). Post-procedural complications occurred after 6/29 procedures (21%), all of which were self-limited skin complications. C-arm CT was performed in 19/33 procedures (58%). The lesion-to-skin surface distance was significantly shorter in patients with skin post-procedural complications (p < 0.001). The e-mail-based questionnaire was completed by 13/16 patients (81%). Decrease in swelling, improvement of foot function and a significant decrease in pain (p = 0.003) was reported. No patient reported dis-improvement after sclerotherapy.Percutaneous sclerotherapy is an effective option for treating foot VMs. Skin complication rates are higher with shorter VM-to-skin surface distance.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865314","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.585518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.505357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.346708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.215456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Virtual machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"1316","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1316"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"VM (operating system)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Minuscule 629","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_629"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Decrease (knitting)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrease_(knitting)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
