{"id":91463,"title":"Effects of cumulative trauma load on perceptions of health, blood pressure, and resting heart rate in urban African American youth.","abstract":"This study examined relationships between cumulative trauma (CT) and urban African American (AA) adolescents' blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and perceptions of health.A correlational design using secondary data analysis studied effects of CT, health outcomes, and perceptions of health. Participants were 175 urban AA youth (11-16 years) who completed structured surveys and physiological measures of HR and BP before and after exercise.AA youth were experiencing high levels of CT. Negative correlations were obtained between AA females' perceptions of their health and systolic BP with levels of trauma. No gender differences were found in HR or BP.AA females with high CT may perceive themselves as less healthy and can be at risk for health problems.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502662","annotations":[{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.488031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.379271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.313305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.25769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0245813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1116","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1116"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}]}
