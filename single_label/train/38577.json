{"id":38577,"title":"Martin 'Dick' Wittenborg 1914-1969: a legacy.","abstract":"The life of Martin H. Wittenborg was short. During his tenure at Boston Children's Hospital, he wrote brilliant papers based on his observations regarding such entities as intestinal malrotation and vascular rings and slings. He wrote about his extensive experience using radiotherapy in the treatment of neuroblastoma and its effects on the growing spine. This article reflects the memories of some of his students, who describe him as a brilliant teacher. His effect on so many and his contributions are all the more remarkable considering the fact that Wittenborg was deaf.
