{"id":68541,"title":"Catastrophic systemic embolization from a left atrial myxoma.","abstract":"We report the fatal course of a left atrial myxoma: its systemic embolization to the coronary, cerebral, renal, and peripheral vascular beds in a 39-year-old woman resulted in rapid clinical deterioration, multiorgan failure, and death. Among reported cases of left atrial myxoma, this degree of embolic burden is exceedingly rare. In addition to reporting the patient's case, we discuss the presentation and diagnosis of possible intracardiac sources of systemic emboli.
