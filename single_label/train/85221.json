{"id":85221,"title":"Sputum-to-serum hydrogen sulfide ratio in COPD.","abstract":"Hydrogen sulfide (H?S) is a gas produced by respiratory cells including smooth muscle cells and may play a role as a cellular gasotransmitter. We evaluated whether H?S levels in serum or sputum could represent a new biomarker of COPD in a cross-sectional study.H?S levels in sputum and serum samples were measured using a sulfide-sensitive electrode in 64 patients with stable COPD (S-COPD), 29 COPD subjects during acute exacerbation (AE-COPD), 14 healthy smokers and 21 healthy non-smokers.Sputum H?S levels in AE-COPD subjects were higher than those in S-COPD, healthy smoking and non-smoking subjects (p<0.001), but serum H?S levels in AE-COPD were lower than those in S-COPD (p<0.001). Thus, the sputum-to-serum ratio of H?S (H?S ratio) in AE-COPD subjects were higher than those in stable COPD, healthy smoking and non-smoking subjects (p<0.001). In 14 COPD subjects whose H?S ratios were measured during and after an exacerbation, the mean ratio was increased during exacerbation (p<0.05). H?S ratio was positively correlated with St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, sputum neutrophils and IL-6 and IL-8 levels in sputum and serum (p<0.01) but inversely correlated with sputum macrophages (%), FEV?%predicted and FEV?/FVC (p<0.01). The cut-off level of H?S ratio to indicate an exacerbation was ?0.44 (sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 84.5%).The ratio of sputum-to-serum levels of H?S may provide a useful marker of COPD indicative of obstructive neutrophilic inflammation and of potential ongoing exacerbation.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035127","annotations":[{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Hydrogen sulfide","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.736088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.721288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.684582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.582581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.545423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Sulfide","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfide"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"}]}
