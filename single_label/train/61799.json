{"id":61799,"title":"Engraftment syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults.","abstract":"We performed a retrospective study of the engraftment syndrome (ES) as defined by the Spitzer Criteria in adult patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for various hematological malignancies at a single institution, over a decade, and analyzed its relationship to acute GVHD; 217 patients underwent either myeloablative (38.7%) or reduced intensity (61.3%) HCT; 22.1% met the criteria for ES. Acute GVHD prophylaxis (P?=?0.006) and transplants prior to 2006 (P?<?0.0001) were significantly associated with a risk of ES in univariable analysis. Early aGVHD within 4 weeks of engraftment was significantly more common in the ES compared to the non ES cohort (21 vs. 8.3% respectively, P?=?0.02). ES did not predict for future GVHD, as at day +180, the cumulative incidences of grades II-IV aGVHD (31 vs. 23%, P?=?0.19) and of chronic GVHD at 2 years of engraftment (42 vs. 36%, P?=?0.28) were not significantly different between the ES and non ES groups, respectively. No significant differences in NRM, overall survival and progression-free survival were observed between the two groups. Although predictive of early aGVHD, ES occurred independently of GVHD in 79% of the patients. Survival outcomes should be evaluated in a larger randomized study to investigate if there is a correlation with ES.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668776","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.802167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.794623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.706433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.057721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Spitzer Space Telescope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
