{"id":85005,"title":"Pidotimod may prevent recurrent respiratory infections in children.","abstract":"Recurrent respiratory infections (RRI) constitute a social problem for both the pharmaco-economic impact and the burden for the family. Pidotimod is a synthetic immunostimulant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pidotimod on RRI prevention in children.Globally, 100 children (49 males, mean age 4.7 Â± 1.2 years) with RRI were enrolled in the study. At baseline, children were randomly assigned to the treatment with pidotimod 400 mg/die or not for two months. Children were visited at baseline, after 30 (T1) and 60 (T2) days, and at follow-up (120 days; T3). Number of children with upper and lower airways symptoms, medications use, school attendance, and paediatric visits for RRI were evaluated.Pidotimod treatment was able of significantly reducing the number of children with upper and lower airways symptoms, and medications use, increasing school attendance, and reducing pediatric visits for RRI.This study provided the evidence that pidotimod may be able of preventing RRI in children.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253184","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.812086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.636032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.615461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0855793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Social issues","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issues"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunostimulant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostimulant"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Radio Republik Indonesia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Republik_Indonesia"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Pharmacoeconomics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacoeconomics"}]}
