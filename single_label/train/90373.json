{"id":90373,"title":"Ability of walking without a walking device in patients with spinal cord injury as determined using data from functional tests.","abstract":"More than half of independent ambulatory patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) need a walking device to promote levels of independence. However, long-lasting use of a walking device may introduce negative impacts for the patients. Using a standard objective test relating to the requirement of a walking device may offer a quantitative criterion to effectively monitor levels of independence of the patients. Therefore, this study investigated (1) ability of the three functional tests, including the five times sit-to-stand test (FTSST), timed up and go test (TUGT), and 10-meter walk test (10MWT) to determine the ability of walking without a walking device, and (2) the inter-tester reliability of the tests to assess functional ability in patients with SCI.Sixty independent ambulatory patients with SCI, who walked with and without a walking device (30 subjects/group), were assessed cross-sectionally for their functional ability using the three tests. The first 20 subjects also participated in the inter-tester reliability test.The time required to complete the FTSST <14 seconds, the TUGT < 18 seconds, and the 10MWT < 6 seconds had good-to-excellent capability to determine the ability of walking without a walking device of subjects with SCI. These tests also showed excellent inter-tester reliability.Methods of clinical evaluation for walking are likely performed using qualitative observation, which makes the results difficult to compare among testers and test intervals. Findings of this study offer a quantitative target criterion or a clear level of ability that patients with SCI could possibly walk without a walking device, which would benefit monitoring process for the patients.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621030","annotations":[{"name":"Data","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.0707274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Base on balls","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Software testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Objective test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_test"},{"name":"Functional testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing"},{"name":"Aquaculture of salmon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_of_salmon"},{"name":"2007 enlargement of the European Union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_enlargement_of_the_European_Union"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
