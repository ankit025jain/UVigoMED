{"id":47635,"title":"[Establishment of a detection method for hepatitis B virus large surface protein (HBV-lP)].","abstract":"To establish enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of hepatitis B virus large surface protein(HBV-LP) in serum.A sandwich reaction was preformed with horseradish peroxidase labeled monoclonal antibody of HBV-LP as the catalytic enzyme. Several reactions liquid's concentration and reaction conditions were optimized. The method was evaluated in all aspects such as sensitivity, specificity, stability and so on.The detection limit was 5 ng/ml. Interassay and intra-assay RSD were both less than 10%. After stored at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 3, 5, 7 days, the analysis showed correlation coefficient higher than 0.98 and RSD lower than 10%.Established ELISA for determination of serum HBV-LP has high sensitivity and repeatability.
