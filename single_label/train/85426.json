{"id":85426,"title":"Randomized trial of a health communication intervention for parents of children with asthma.","abstract":"To determine if a health communication intervention targeting parents of high-risk, urban, minority children with asthma could (i) improve parental perceptions of connectedness to and communication with their child's primary care providers (PCP) and (ii) decrease reliance on emergency departments (EDs) and other urgent care services for their child's asthma-related care.The design was a single blind, parallel groups, randomized controlled trial. Parents were recruited from an ED-based asthma clinic serving primarily low-income, minority children in Washington, DC. The intervention involved face-to-face education on effective communication followed by a single booster call. Standardized instruments were administered to assess primary care connectedness and healthcare utilization at baseline and 2- and 6-months post-enrollment.A total of 150 parents of children 1-12 years old were randomized (77 intervention and 73 usual care), and 137 (91%) were successfully followed for six months. Only at the two-month follow-up time-point, parents in the intervention group were significantly more likely to identify a PCP as the main source of their child's asthma care (adjusted odds ratio: 12.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-142.1) and to report a significant reduction in ED visits for asthma care (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.8). There was no significant effect on parent communication self-efficacy or number of PCP visits.A brief, in-person health communication intervention for parents of high-risk children with asthma resulted in improved identification of PCPs as the usual source of asthma care and reduced reliance on EDs for asthma care, albeit only for two months post-intervention.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945884","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.529085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.514229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.450836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Washington, D.C.","weight":0.372947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.363254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.258332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.167091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Urgent care","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgent_care"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Phencyclidine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1142","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1142"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Academic department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_department"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Health communication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_communication"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"}]}
