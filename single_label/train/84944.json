{"id":84944,"title":"[Neurobehavioral development in preterm infants: a retrospective study of 181 cases].","abstract":"To investigate the results of Gesell Developmental Scale in follow-up of preterm infants and to determine possible high-risk factors for poor long-term neurological outcome.A preterm infants' questionnaire was designed, and a retrospective study was conducted on the clinical data of 181 preterm infants (corrected age 2-12 months) and their mothers. The developmental quotient (DQ) scores were determined by the Gesell Developmental Scale and statistically analyzed.Compared with those with a birth weight (BW) of ?1?500?g, the preterm infants with a BW of <1?500?g had significantly reduced DQ scores of adaptability, gross motor movement, and fine movement (P<0.05). Compared with those with a gestational age (GA) of ?32 weeks, the preterm infants with a GA of <32 weeks had significantly reduced DQ scores of adaptability, gross motor movement, fine movement, and social contact (P<0.05). DQ scores on five Gesell subscales were significantly positively correlated with GA and BW (P<0.05). The DQ scores on Gesell subscales showed a significant negative correlation with severe complications in neonatal period (P<0.001).For preterm infants, BW <1?500?g and GA <32 weeks are high-risk factors for abnormal adaptability, gross motor movement, fine movement, and social contact, and this group of infants should be followed up closely. Severe complications in neonatal period may be associated with poor long-term neurological outcome and should be effectively prevented and treated.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008875","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.729798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.582717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.457326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.263883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.213812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Social contact","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contact"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Gross motor skill","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_motor_skill"}]}
