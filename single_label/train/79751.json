{"id":79751,"title":"Some studies on Capillaria philipinensis and its mysterious trip from Philippines to Egypt (review article).","abstract":"Capillaria philippinensis is a mysterious parasite and intestinal capillariasis is a mysterious disease. It is now more than half a century since the discovery of the first case in Philippines without answering many questions concerning the parasite's taxonomy, morphology, life cycle, diagnosis, pathology, clinical symptoms, mode of transmission as well as how it was transported to Egypt and how it started to spread and progressed in most Egyptian Governorates; particularly those of Middle Egypt. This article is a trial to overview all these aspects of the parasite.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961022","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Philippines","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.666946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.541319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.349198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.318234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.233214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Middle Egypt","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Egypt"},{"name":"Capillaria philippinensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillaria_philippinensis"},{"name":"Capillaria (genus)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillaria_(genus)"},{"name":"Capillariasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillariasis"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Governorate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Review article","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"}]}
