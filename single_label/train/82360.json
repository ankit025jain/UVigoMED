{"id":82360,"title":"A CAD/CAM designed, semi-fixed, high strength, all-ceramic prosthesis for maxillary rehabilitation--a case report.","abstract":"The clinical and laboratory steps involved in rehabilitating the maxillary arch following the loss of several teeth due to periodontal disease are outlined in this case report. This article illustrates the use of a laboratory based CAD/CAM system (Sirona In-Lab) and a copy milling technique in the fabrication of a fixed-movable bridge, high strength, all-ceramic, cross-arch bridge.Adopting a semi-fixed approach in cross-arch rehabilitation has conventionally involved the use of porcelain fused to metal (PFM) components but the demands placed by patients and clinicians have led to the development of novel techniques in order to achieve highly aesthetic and functional results.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640479","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.719914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Porcelain","weight":0.570028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.475616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Computer-aided technologies","weight":0.116551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_technologies"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Sirona","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirona"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Milling machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_machine"},{"name":"Fabrication (metal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrication_(metal)"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Premiata Forneria Marconi","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiata_Forneria_Marconi"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"}]}
