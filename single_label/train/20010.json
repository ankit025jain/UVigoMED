{"id":20010,"title":"Meningococcal disease in children and teenagers.","abstract":"Meningococcal disease is a leading cause of death in children and young people. It causes two major disease processes, meningococcal septicaemia and meningococcal meningitis, and often results in long-term health complications. It remains a difficult disease to recognise and treat. This article, part one in a two-part series, discusses the epidemiology of meningococcal disease and explains its pathophysiology as well as signs and symptoms. Part 2, to be published on 19 March, will review diagnosis, management and prevention.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683749","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.630419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.547122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.500577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.468822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Meningococcal disease","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.0263423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"March 19","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_19"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"}]}
