{"id":12786,"title":"Correlation of expression of STAT3, VEGF and differentiation of Th17 cells in psoriasis vulgaris of guinea pig.","abstract":"To investigate the role of T help 17 cells (Th17) and STAT3-VEGF pathway in pathogenesis of psoriasis.A total of 50 cases of psoriasis guinea pigs and 20 normal guinea pigs were selected. The ratio of Th17/ IL-17 cell in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometric analysis; STAT3 and VEGF concentrations were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.The expression of Th17 in peripheral blood were significantly increased in psoriasis [(1.76±0.88)%] compared with controls [(0.48±0.27)%] (P<0.05). Th17 related cytokine STAT3 and VEGF were significantly increased in psoriasis compared with controls (P<0.05), and were positively correlated the expression of Th17.The expressions of Th17, STAT3 and VEGF are elevated in psoriasis, which suggests Th17 cells have a potential role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by STAT3-VEGF pathway.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507689","annotations":[{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.91249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.688858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.550624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.53271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.141042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0187755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Guinea","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
