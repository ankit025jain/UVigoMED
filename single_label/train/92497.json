{"id":92497,"title":"In-depth analysis of local recurrence of giant cell tumour of bone with soft tissue extension after intralesional curettage.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the local recurrence rate of giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) with soft tissue extension, to identify characteristics of the soft tissue extension that can best indicate recurrence of GCTB after intralesional curettage.A total of 48 cases of GCTB with soft tissue extension after intralesional curettage were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups based on various objective features of soft tissue extension including size, number, margins, involvement of adjacent tissues, signal intensity, static enhancement and Jaffe grade. The local recurrence rate was compared using the Chi-square test and Chi-square value correction for continuity. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.The local recurrence rate was significantly different according to soft tissue extension size, number and margins (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the groups of adjacent tissue involvement and Jaffe grade (p > 0.05). Size, number and margins of the soft tissue extension were independent risk factors of local recurrence of GCTB after intralesional curettage (p < 0.05).The local recurrence rate of GCTB with soft tissue extension after intralesional curettage is higher if the soft tissue extension is large, multiple and lacking bone envelope integrity. For cases with the above-mentioned features, we suggest that the higher recurrence rate can be taken into full consideration when choosing appropriate surgical procedures.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604549","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.886823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.485707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.357278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.142983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.0557848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.033431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Recursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Signal processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Envelope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Jaffe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffe"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"}]}
