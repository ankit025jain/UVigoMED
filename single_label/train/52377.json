{"id":52377,"title":"Vitamin D increases serum levels of the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products in women with PCOS.","abstract":"Elevation of serum proinflammatory advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is involved in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The soluble receptor for AGEs (sRAGE) acts as a decoy by binding circulating AGEs. Vitamin D supplementation attenuates the deposition of AGEs in the vascular system of diabetic animals and improves some metabolic aspects of vitamin D-deficient women with PCOS. Additionally, serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is elevated in women with PCOS, reflecting abnormal ovarian folliculogenesis.The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vit D3) supplementation on serum sRAGE and AMH in vitamin D-deficient women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: Sixty-seven women with (n = 22) or without (control; n = 45) PCOS who were diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency were enrolled. Fifty-one women were replaced with oral vit D3 for 8 weeks (16 with PCOS and 35 controls) and 16 women were not treated (six with PCOS and 10 controls). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH-D), sRAGE, and AMH concentrations were measured at baseline and after vit D3 supplementation in the treated group and 8 weeks apart in the nontreated group.Changes in serum sRAGE and AMH concentrations after vit D3 replacement were measured.In all participants, there was a negative correlation between body mass index and serum sRAGE levels (r = -0.3, P = .01). In women with PCOS, but not in controls, vit D3 increased serum sRAGE (P = .03) and decreased serum AMH levels (P < .001). The increase in serum sRAGE positively correlated with the increase in serum 25 OH-D after supplementation in women with PCOS (r = 0.6, P = .01).In women with PCOS, vit D3 might exert a protective effect against the inflammatory action of AGEs by increasing circulating sRAGE. The normalization in serum AMH induced by vit D3 replacement suggests an improvement in folliculogenesis.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606102","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.810129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.790689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.74024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.665592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.561941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.554502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.461443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.430124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Advanced glycation end-product","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Folliculogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculogenesis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
