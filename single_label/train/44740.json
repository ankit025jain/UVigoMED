{"id":44740,"title":"Reconstruction using a free jejunal graft after resection of the cervical esophagus for malignancy.","abstract":"Reconstruction using a free jejunal graft (FJG) after resection of the cervical esophagus has become common, but postoperative morbidity remains. We report herein our procedure and the results of reconstruction for neck cancer using FJGs.Twenty-four patients underwent FJG reconstruction after laryngo-pharyngo-esophagectomy. We perform a mini-laparotomy with a 5-cm para- or trans-rectus muscle incision. The FJG is then harvested from the jejunum supplied by the second or third mesenteric artery, and a jejunostomy is created. Pharyngo-jejunal anastomosis is performed using an Albert-Lembert suture and jejunal-esophageal anastomosis by a circular stapling technique. The facial artery or suprathyroid artery is used as the feeding artery, and the common facial vein or external jugular vein as the drainage vein. Vascular anastomosis is performed microsurgically.In terms of postoperative morbidity, minor anastomosis leakage of the pharyngo-jejunal anastomosis was observed in one patient, stricture of the jejunal-esophageal anastomosis in four, and wound infection in one. No cases of passage disorder due to graft bending were seen, and no patients died.The procedure using FJG harvested via mini-laparotomy is minimally invasive and is a feasible procedure for reconstruction after laryngo-pharyngo-esophagectomy, resulting in low morbidity.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719936","annotations":[{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.898993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.826578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.779563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.765761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.688502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric artery","weight":0.484604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.424642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.415535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.390919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.30341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Facial artery","weight":0.295801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_artery"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.277966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.133949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"External jugular vein","weight":0.130696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Common facial vein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_facial_vein"},{"name":"Facial vein","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_vein"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"}]}
