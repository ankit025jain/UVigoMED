{"id":67568,"title":"Eotaxin-1 promotes prostate cancer cell invasion via activation of the CCR3-ERK pathway and upregulation of MMP-3 expression.","abstract":"Chemokines have been reported to play crucial roles in tumor progression. Eotaxin-1 (CCL11), a member of the CC chemokine family, is elevated in many types of human cancer. Here, to reveal the molecular mechanisms of eotaxin-1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, the expression of eotaxin-1 receptors [CC chemokine receptor (CCR)2, CCR3 and CCR5] were silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). The ERK pathway was inhibited by the specific MEK inhibitor U0126. The role of eotaxin-1 and the CCR3-ERK pathway in prostate cancer cell invasion was assessed by invasion and migration assays. MMP-3 expression was detected by real-time PCR and ELISA assay. The results demonstrated that eotaxin-1 promoted the invasion and migration of DU-145 cells, and increased ERK1/2 activation and MMP-3 expression. Knockdown of CCR3 inhibited the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells, and attenuated the eotaxin-1-induced ERK1/2 activation and MMP-3 expression. Furthermore, inactivation of the ERK pathway suppressed the eotaxin?1-promoted invasion and migration, and decreased MMP-3 expression in the prostate cancer cells. Together, the present study suggests that eotaxin-1 increases MMP-3 expression via the CCR3-ERK pathway, thereby promoting prostate cancer cell invasion and migration. Thus, therapies that block eotaxin-1 and CCR3 may be effective interventions for prostate cancer.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604010","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"CCR5","weight":0.85423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5"},{"name":"Chemokine receptor","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine_receptor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.789453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.751748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.715025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.667143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.450172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.175637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"CCL11","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL11"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"}]}
