{"id":63245,"title":"Quantification of myocardial iron deficiency in nonischemic heart failure by cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to use T2* cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to quantify myocardial iron content in patients with heart failure (HF) and to investigate the relation between iron content, cardiac function, and the cause of HF. CMR data were analyzed from 167 patients with nonischemic and 31 with ischemic HF and 50 patients with normal ventricular function. Short-axis T2* imaging was accomplished using 3-T scanner and multiecho gradient-echo sequence. Myocardial T2* value (M-T2*) was calculated by fitting the signal intensity data for the mid-left ventricular (LV) septum to a decay curve. Patients with nonischemic HF were categorized into patients with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <35% or ?35%. The relation between nonischemic HF with LVEF <35% and the risk for major adverse cardiac events was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis using M-T2* and HF biomarkers. M-T2* was significantly greater for patients with nonischemic HF (LVEF <35%: 29 ± 7 ms, LVEF ?35%: 26 ± 5 ms) than for patients with normal LV function (22 ± 3 ms, p <0.0001) or ischemic HF (22 ± 4 ms, p <0.001). The odds ratio was 1.21 for M-T2* (p <0.0001) and 1.0015 for brain natriuretic peptide (p <0.0001) in relation to nonischemic HF with LVEF <35%. Furthermore, this value was 0.96 for systolic blood pressure (p = 0.012) and 1.02 for M-T2* (p = 0.03) in relation to the risk for major adverse cardiac events in patients with nonischemic HF. In conclusion, T2* CMR demonstrated the robust relation between myocardial iron deficiency and nonischemic HF. M-T2* is a biomarker that can predict adverse cardiac function in patients with nonischemic HF.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461766","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.788238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.774725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.718452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.707482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.704693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.54204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.433351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.301339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Brain natriuretic peptide","weight":0.282223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.175337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0508816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
