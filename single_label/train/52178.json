{"id":52178,"title":"Adenomatous multinodular goiter causing airway obstruction in an infant.","abstract":"Nontoxic adenomatous multinodular goiter (AMNG) in infants is a rare condition. We discuss an extremely rare case of a nontoxic AMNG in a 3-month-old female presenting with airway obstruction. Surgical resection of the mass was performed to reduce the burden on the airway and for diagnosis. The literature is reviewed, and the clinical characteristics, pathology, and surgical treatment are discussed.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622964","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.773069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.6799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.328827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0505576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
