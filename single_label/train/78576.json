{"id":78576,"title":"[Relationships between the dental arches measurements and the peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF): a cross sectional study on 78 Senegalese teenagers].","abstract":"Upper airways obstruction can result in the reduction of the transversal dimensions of the maxillary arch which affect the vertical and the sagittal dimensions. The PNIF measure is an objec- tive and cheap way to assess the upper airways permeability. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between PNIF and dental arch sizes.Seventy eight patients (40 girls and 38 boys) age ranged 10-15 years were included in this cross sectional study. The PNIF was measured with a Youlten peak flow meter (Clement Clarke International, London, United Kingdom). The sagittal, vertical and transversal dimensions of the dental arches were evaluated on dental casts with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). T test was used to assess differences in PNIF and dental arches variables between subjects grouped according to sex (male and female). The Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between the dental arches sizes and the PNIF. The significance was set at p < 0.05.PNIF rate was higher in girls than in boys but the difference was not significant. There were sexual dimorphism regarding the anterior and total lengths of the upper arch, the total length of the lower arch and the maxillary intermolar width which are significantly more important for boys (p respectively equal to 0.05; 0.03; 0.04 and 0.04). The PNIF was significantly and negatively correlated with the total length of the upper arch (r = -0.25). The others measurements did not show significant correlation with PNIF.Others parameters are needed to complement the peak nasal inspiratory flow rate for the respiratory disorders related dental arches sizes abnormalities diagnosis.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
