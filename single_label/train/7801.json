{"id":7801,"title":"Therapeutic angiogenesis in a murine model of limb ischemia by recombinant periostin and its fasciclin I domain.","abstract":"Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, is expressed in injured tissues, such as the heart with myocardial infarction, and promotes angiogenesis and tissue repair. However, the molecular mechanism associated with periostin-stimulated angiogenesis and tissue repair is still unclear. In order to clarify the role of periostin in neovascularization, we examined the effect of periostin in angiogenic potentials of human endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) in vitro and in an ischemic limb animal model. Recombinant periostin protein stimulated the migration and tube formation of ECFCs. To identify the functional domains of periostin implicated in angiogenesis, five fragments of periostin, including four repeating FAS-1 domains and a carboxyl terminal domain, were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Of the five different domains, the first FAS-1 domain stimulated the migration and tube formation of human ECFCs as potent as the whole periostin. Chemotactic migration of ECFCs induced by the full length and the first FAS-1 domain of periostin was abrogated by blocking antibodies against ?3 and ?5 integrins. Intramuscular injection of the full length and the first FAS-1 domain of periostin into the ischemic hindlimb of mice attenuated severe limb loss and promoted blood perfusion and homing of intravenously administered ECFCs to the ischemic limb. These results suggest that the first FAS-1 domain is responsible for periostin-induced migration and angiogenesis and it can be used as a therapeutic tool for treatment of peripheral artery occlusive disease by stimulating homing of ECFCs.
