{"id":47442,"title":"Differentiating small (?1?cm) focal liver lesions as metastases or cysts by means of computed tomography: a case-study to illustrate a fuzzy logic-based method to assess the impact of diagnostic confidence on radiological diagnosis.","abstract":"To quantify the impact of diagnostic confidence on radiological diagnosis with a fuzzy logic-based method.Twenty-two oncologic patients with 20 cysts and 30 metastases ?1?cm in size found at 64-row computed tomography were included. Two readers (R1/R2) expressed diagnoses as a subjective level of confidence P(d) in malignancy within the interval [0,1] rather than on a \"crisp\" basis (malignant/benign); confidence in benignancy was 1 - p(d). When cross-tabulating data according to the standard of reference, 2 Ã— 2 table cells resulted from the aggregation between p(d)/1 - p(d) and final diagnosis. We then assessed (i) readers diagnostic performance on a fuzzy and crisp basis; (ii) the \"divergence\" ?(F, C) (%) as a measure of how confidence impacted on crisp diagnosis.Diagnoses expressed with lower confidence increased fuzzy false positives compared to crisp ones (from 0 to 0.2 for R1; from 1 to 2.4 for R2). Crisp/fuzzy accuracy was 94.0%/93.6% (R1) and 94.0/91.6% (R2). ?(F, C) (%) was larger in the case of the less experienced reader (R2) (up to +7.95% for specificity). According to simulations, ?(F, C) (%) was negative/positive depending on the level of confidence in incorrect diagnoses.Fuzzy evaluation shows a measurable effect of uncertainty on radiological diagnoses.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587815","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.678215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.6301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.560287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.551808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.537544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.349266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Divergence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Potato chip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Fuzzy logic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Pure Data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Toyota R engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_R_engine"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Palladium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
