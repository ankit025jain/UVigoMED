{"id":50696,"title":"Differentiated thyroid carcinoma risk factors in French Polynesia.","abstract":"To investigate differentiated thyroid cancer risk factors in natives of French Polynesia is of interest because of the very high incidence of this cancer in the archipelago.To assess the role of various potential risk factors of thyroid cancer in the natives of French Polynesia we performed a case-control study. The study included almost all the French Polynesians diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma between 1981 and 2003 (n=229) and 373 French Polynesian control individuals from the general population without cancer.Thyroid radiation dose received from nuclear fallout before the age of 15, a personal history of neck or/and head medical irradiation, obesity, tallness, large number of children, an artificial menopause, a familial history of thyroid cancer, a low dietary iodine intake, and having a spring as the main source of drinking water were found to be significant risk factors. No roles of smoking habits, alcohol consumption, iodine containing drugs, and exposure to pesticides were evidenced.Except for smoking, differentiated thyroid carcinoma risk factors in natives of French Polynesia are similar to those in other populations. Our finding on the role of having a spring as a drinking water origin is coherent with some other studies and could be due to geological factors.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761883","annotations":[{"name":"Nuclear fallout","weight":0.848381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.847389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Pesticide","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.639022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.620188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Polynesia","weight":0.490886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesia"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.457949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.366177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"France","weight":0.345539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.345083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.291173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Geology","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology"},{"name":"French Polynesia","weight":0.119746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Archipelago","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago"},{"name":"Polynesians","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesians"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
