{"id":3574,"title":"[Clinical characteristics research of shenmai injection treating tumor based on hospital information system in real world].","abstract":"The study was to research the clinical characteristics of Shenmai injection treating tumor based on hospital information system, including the characteristics of the age, the sex, the dosage, the course of the treatment and the combination drugs. The data of tumor patients injected with Shenmai injection was analyzed. The information was collected from the hospital information system (HIS) in twenty hospitals of grade III-A. The method of frequencies and association rules was used in this reaearch. The patients over 45 years old were up to 3 338, about 79.36% of the whole. The ratio of male and female was 1.73: 1. The hospitalization day between 15 and 28 was most. The complications of the hypertension and coronary heart disease happened most. The support was 5.939% and 5.099% respectively. Fifty-five patients had the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome of Qi-Yin deficiency, about 14.78% of the whole. There were 8 491 patients treated with the single dose of 81 to 100 mL, about 48.70% of the whole. The main combination drugs were dexamethasone, tropisetron and maxolon. The confidence was 44.63%, 31.22% and 20.53% respectively. The information from HIS showed that tumor patients used Shenmai injection were most quinquagenarian with smooth condition. The dose of the Shenmai injection sometimes was higher than that of the drug use instructions in clinical. Shenmai injection was most often combined with glucocorticoid, antemetic and nutritional support medicine when treating tumor in clinical.","date":"2014-12-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25532386","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.914316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.811716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.795565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.742055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.696675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.544661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.308922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.302835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Hospital information system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system"},{"name":"Tropisetron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropisetron"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
