{"id":92220,"title":"Insights and advances in post-traumatic headache: research considerations.","abstract":"Despite the growing awareness of mild traumatic brain injury in military and civilian populations, understanding of the acute and chronic effects of concussion on central nervous system structure and function is limited. Even less is understood about the underpinnings of the cardinal postconcussive symptom, post-traumatic headache (PTH). Here, we review recent advances in PTH, with special emphasis on the migraine-like phenotype, the most disabling form. Considerations for future research in PTH are discussed, including diagnostic classification, and applications with advanced neuroimaging techniques, biomarkers, and treatments.
