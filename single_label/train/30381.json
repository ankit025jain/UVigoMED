{"id":30381,"title":"In vitro assays of chemotaxis as a window into mechanisms of toxicant-induced immunomodulation.","abstract":"Dysregulated cell movement can lead to developmental abnormalities, neoplasia, and immune system disorders, and there are a variety of contexts in which xenobiotics (and biologic) effects on this movement are of interest. Many toxins and toxicants have been shown to disrupt controlled cell movement. Identification of compounds that affect cell movement is crucial to drug discovery. Drug components may have unexpected consequences with respect to cell motility, which would exclude these compounds in drug development. Finally, the development of drugs that target chemotactic pathways may be useful in the treatment of tumors, which often reprogram chemotactic pathways to become metastatic. The effects of these agents on cell movement can be measured using several different in vitro chemotactic assays. This review details the procedures of three in vitro measurements of chemotaxis: the Boyden chamber, the under-agarose assay, and the automated, real-time, ECIS/Taxis assay, and discusses the inferences that can be drawn from the results of such studies.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510542","annotations":[{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.777841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Xenobiotic","weight":0.481407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.420108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.149996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Congenital abnormality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_abnormality"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"}]}
