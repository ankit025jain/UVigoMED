{"id":24006,"title":"[The application of recombinant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine and its vector in infectious disease].","abstract":"Recent studies show that the vector of recombinant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (rBCG) has a series of advantages. With exogenous gene and vaccine in one inoculation, it can obtain strong and persistent immune response at one time so that BCG is considered as a kind of ideal vector for live recombinant vaccine. This review outlines the application of rBCG vaccine and its vector in infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, other microorganisms and parasites.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459985","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.59774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.514425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.485245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"}]}
