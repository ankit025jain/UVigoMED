{"id":36708,"title":"Neuropsychological impairments in elderly Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients.","abstract":"Cognitive performance is compromised in Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, but neuropsychological data including elderly NF1 are extremely sparse. We compared the cognitive performance of a small elderly NF1 group (n = 5) with an age-matched healthy control group (n = 49). NF1 group performed worse than control group on a global cognitive impairment task, verbal working memory, and visuospatial functioning. The results suggest that cognitive impairment is an important feature of NF1 across lifespan, including elderly individuals. Future studies approaching the NF1 cognitive profile might benefit from looking at the mechanisms linked to the age-related aspects of cognitive decline.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556498","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Working memory","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.614233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.373935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis","weight":0.0344861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis type I","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis_type_I"},{"name":"Spatial-temporal reasoning","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial-temporal_reasoning"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Sparse matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Radiation induced cognitive decline","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_induced_cognitive_decline"}]}
