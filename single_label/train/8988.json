{"id":8988,"title":"Retrospective evaluation of the use of autologous blood-patch treatment for persistent pneumothorax in 8 dogs (2009-2012).","abstract":"To describe the clinical course, outcome and success rate of 8 dogs with persistent pneumothorax treated with autologous blood-patch pleurodesis (ABP).Retrospective case series.University teaching hospitalEight client-owned dogs.Non-coagulated blood was aseptically collected from the jugular vein and injected immediately into the pleural cavity of dogs with persistent pneumothorax.The procedure was successful in 7 of 8 dogs. The median duration of pneumothorax until the ABP was performed was 4 days (range 2-6 days). Pneumothorax resolved immediately after 1 treatment in 4 dogs. Pleurodesis was repeated once in 3 dogs, and twice in 1 case after which it resolved in 3 of the 4 dogs. Out of a total of 13 ABP procedures performed in 8 dogs, 5 (62.5%) were successful after 1 procedure and the success rate increased to 87.5% after additional procedures. One dog failed ABP and was euthanized 3 days later due to continued deterioration and a hospital acquired pneumonia. Mild to moderate complications occurred in 2 other dogs and resolved in both.ABP is a simple, inexpensive, and relatively safe procedure which can be considered in dogs with persistent pneumothorax that have failed conservative or surgical management. Infections following ABP were documented in 2 of the 8 dogs and resolved in 1 dog.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739036","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.817895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.808004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.663645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.424048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Pleurodesis","weight":0.42343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurodesis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.381049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.282358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.122383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Christmas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas"},{"name":"Mild ale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_ale"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Aseptic processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseptic_processing"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
