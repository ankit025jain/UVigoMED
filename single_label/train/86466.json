{"id":86466,"title":"Correlation of ultrasound B-lines with high-resolution computed tomography in antisynthetase syndrome.","abstract":"Interstitial lung disease is a common finding in patients with the antisynthetase syndrome. High-resolution computed tomography is the reference test for diagnosis and follow-up of this condition, but it involves considerable radiation exposure. Our aim was to describe chest ultrasound features and its correlation with high-resolution computed tomography findings in a series of patients with the antisynthetase syndrome.The study included patients from our antisynthetase syndrome cohort with varying degrees of interstitial lung disease, consulting in our outpatient clinic over a 1-year period. Chest high-resolution computed tomography and chest sonography were prospectively performed within a 1-week period. High-resolution computed tomography Warrick score was calculated and chest sonography findings (B-lines) at several sonographic points along the anterior and posterior intercostal spaces were semi-quantitatively analyzed. Rho Spearman statistics were applied for possible correlations.Twenty-one consecutive patients were studied. A median of 59 thoracic points was studied per patient (IQR 6); 44.1% (95% CI 29.9-60.7) of them showed at least one B-line. A correlation coefficient of 0.135 (p=0.5) was found between the percentage of ultrasound points with B-lines and the Warrick's score. Only the number of bronchopulmonary segments showing ground glass findings was associated with the percentage of sonographic points with B-lines (Rho=0.5, p=0.02).A good correlation between the percentage of sonographic points with B-lines and high-resolution computed tomography ground glass opacities was observed in patients with the antisynthetase syndrome.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773767","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.597707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.506182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.440411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.429299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.334377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.333138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Interstitial lung disease","weight":0.290833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.284267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.267041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.219756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0484492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Intercostal space","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_space"},{"name":"Bronchopulmonary segment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_segment"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"}]}
