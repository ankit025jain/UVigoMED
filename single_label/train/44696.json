{"id":44696,"title":"[A case-control study on the risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma in Guizhou Province].","abstract":"To determine the risk factor of HCC in Guizhou.A group case-control study design was conducted between 762 cases and 798 controls in Guizhou province. The main related-factors were analyzed with unconditional logistic regression model and evaluated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).There are significant differences between cases and controls in regarding to cigarette smoking 210 (27.6%),non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 336 (44.1%), alcoholic liver disease 245 (32.2%), family history of HCC 141 (16.5%), alcohol consumption 300 (39.4%), HBV infection 436 (57.2%), pickled food 290 (38.1%), and economic status 5 years ago 420 (55.1%) in cases,and cigarette smoking 116 (14.5%),non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 160 (20.1%), alcoholic liver disease 101 (12.7%), family history of HCC 40 (5.0%), alcohol consumption 180 (22.6%), HBV infection 82 (10.3%), pickled food 225 (28.2%), and economic status 5 years ago 647 (81.1%) in controls, with OR of each variable was 3.520, 2.464, 4.330, 2.219, 2.451, 19.245, 6.212, 0.174 respectively, P less than 0.01.HBV infection and pickled food were the most common risks for HCC in Guizhou.
