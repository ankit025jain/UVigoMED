{"id":65149,"title":"Patient-reported sexual outcomes after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: a 3-year follow-up study.","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term patient reported sexual function outcomes of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to prostate enlargement.Three hundred ninety-three patients underwent a HoLEP between August 2007 and July 2013 and were reviewed in this retrospective analysis. Sexual function outcomes were assessed before HoLEP, and again at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery using the International Index of Erectile Function 5 survey. International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) were included for comparison and contextual functional outcome analysis.At the time of surgery, the mean age was 70.9 years (52.0-89.0 years), mean body mass index was 27.7 kg/m(2) (18.0-48.0 kg/m(2)), and mean prostate volume was 96.7 g (20.1-375.0 g). Mean International Index of Erectile Function 5 scores at 3 (13.3 ± 8.37), 6 (12.1 ± 8.76), 12 (12.1 ± 8.83), 24 (12.6 ± 8.80), and 36 months (12.5 ± 8.45) showed no significant change from baseline. There was, however, a significant improvement from baseline seen in IPSS over the same time period (P = .0001).These data confirm HoLEP has a significant impact on IPSS and no adverse impact on long-term patient reported sexual function. We believe this series represents the largest cohort with the longest follow-up to date. It represents an important tool for preoperative patient counseling for those patients considering surgical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24958488","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Holmium","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmium"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.284565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"1375","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1375"},{"name":"1212","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1212"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
