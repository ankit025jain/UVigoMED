{"id":63286,"title":"Severe hypophosphataemia after intravenous iron administration.","abstract":"Currently, in many centres, intravenous administration of iron is becoming increasingly popular because of higher efficacy and decreased side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, compared with oral iron therapy. Studies of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose administration in the postpartum setting and in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease revealed a decrease in serum phosphate levels that was generally asymptomatic and transient. Here, we report four cases of severe and symptomatic hypophosphataemia after intravenous iron administration. All patients received this as therapy for iron deficiency anaemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding. In most cases, a pre-existent disorder in the phosphate homeostasis existed, such as a secondary (cases 3 and 4) or tertiary hyperparathyroidism (case 1). However, in the second case there were no risk factors for a dysregulation of the phosphate homeostasis. Based on these findings, we conclude that severe and symptomatic hypophosphatemia can occur as a side effect of intravenous iron administration and can persist for months after administration. Especially patients with low phosphate levels prior to therapy due to concomitant disorders in phosphate homeostasis (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency) are at risk.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457442","annotations":[{"name":"Iron deficiency anemia","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.849453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.797079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.515945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Hypophosphatemia","weight":0.49872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophosphatemia"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.272369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0853846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"}]}
