{"id":19000,"title":"[Problem of treatment for pyo-inflammatory complications caused by Acinetobacter].","abstract":"The article deals with analysis of a detection frequency and antibacterial treatment resistance of Acinetobacter spp.of different species affiliation. Strains of bacteria detected in patients with pyo-inflammatory complications after surgeries (period from 2010 to 2012) were involved in the study 137 strains of Acinetobacter spp. were detected and studied Fraction of Acinetobacter spp. in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was 2.3, 3 and 3.4% respectively. Fraction of P. aeruginosain all non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria (NFGNB) decreased by 120% and fraction of Acinetobacter spp. increased by 200-250%. Acinetobacter spp. detection frequency was not significantly changed in the period from 2006 to 2012. However the fraction of Acinetobacter spp. in NFGNB increased by 150% and was 29% in 2012. Detection frequency of A. baumanii sharply increased in 2012. A study of antibacterial treatment resistance of Acinetobacter spp. (10 antibacterial medicines) showed that Polymyxin B and E (Colistin) was the most effective medicine for A. baumanii and A. calcoaceticus infection. 85-95% of Acinetobacter spp.strains kept sensitivity to this antibacterial medicine. 66-88.9% of A. baumanii strains, 66.7-81.8% of A. alcoaceticus and 66.6% of other Acinetobacter spp. were sensitive to Tigecycline. Dioxidine effectiveness was close to Tigecycline in 66.7-80% of A. baumanii strains. 85-100% of A. calcoaceticus strains were sensitive to Dioxidine. There is a trend of decreasing of A. baumanii sensitivity to Carbapenems by 200%. Fraction of strains sensitive to Meropenem and Imipenem in 2012 was 21.4% and 16.7% respectively. All studied strains of A. lwoffi and A. haemolyticus kept sensitivity to Carbapenems. In 2012 23.8% of A. baumanii and 50% of A. calcoaceticus strains were sensitivity to Amikacin, meanwhile A. lwoffi and A. haemolyticus were not sensitive to this medicine. 31.3% of A. baumanii and 50% of A. calcoaceticus strains were sensitive to Ceftazidime/Sulbactam. 5.3% of A. baumanii and 15.8% of A. calcoaceticus strains were sensitive to Piperacillin/Sulbactam. Gentamicin effectiveness was fixed in 12.5% of A. baumanii and 45.5% of unidentified Acinetobacter-strains. Gentamicin was not effective against A. lwoffii and A. haemolyticus. Thus Polymyxins (in monotherapy or in combination with glycopeptides), Dioxidine and Tigecycline in combination with Carbapenems or Cefiazidime/Sulbactam are to be drugs of choice in treatment for pyo-inflammatory complications caused by Acinetobacter spp.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749305","annotations":[{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.713286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.62408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Polymyxin B","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxin_B"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.441246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Colistin","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.141172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Amikacin","weight":0.102778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikacin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tigecycline","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline"},{"name":"Polymyxin","weight":0.0585202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxin"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Glycopeptide","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycopeptide"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"781","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/781"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"}]}
