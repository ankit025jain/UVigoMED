{"id":35623,"title":"Sequestrated meningocoele within a naevus sebaceous of Jadassohn on the scalp of a child.","abstract":"Sequestrated meningocoele is an uncommon developmental anomaly in which meningothelial elements are found in the skin or subcutaneous tissue without underlying bony defect. By contrast, naevus sebaceous of Jadassohn (NSJ) is a circumscribed hamartomatous lesion occurring in about 0.3% of newborns. We report a child with a histologically confirmed sequestrated meningocoele within an NSJ on his scalp vertex. Such an occurrence has not been reported previously.
