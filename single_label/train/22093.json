{"id":22093,"title":"The role of thoracoscopic debridement in the treatment of parapneumonic empyema.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of early video-assisted thoracoscopic debridement in patients with the fibropurulent phase of parapneumonic empyema.40 patients with parapneumonic empyema resistant to 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy, were randomly divided into 2 groups. In group 1 (20 patients), antibiotic therapy and irrigation was continued, and in group 2 (20 patients), video-assisted thoracoscopic debridement was performed. The 2 groups were compared in terms of therapeutic results.The male/female ratio was 29/11. Group 1 included 16 men and 4 women with a mean age of 54 years, and mean hospital stay was 41 days. Group 2 consisted of 14 men and 6 women with a mean age of 51 years, and mean hospital stay was 23 days. Considering the therapeutic results, 12 patients in group 1 were cured by antibiotic therapy and irrigation, whereas 8 required decortication and pleurectomy with thoracotomy. In group 2, 18 patients were cured by video-assisted thoracoscopic debridement, and 2 underwent thoracotomy and decortication due to intraoperative bleeding. A significant difference in therapeutic results was noted between the groups (p?=?0.028).Video-assisted thoracoscopic debridement provides a high success rate and less invasive treatment for the early stages of empyema.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570527","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.757284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.404711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Empyema","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.209495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0713674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Decortication of lung","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decortication_of_lung"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Curse of 1940","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_1940"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
