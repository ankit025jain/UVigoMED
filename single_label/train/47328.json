{"id":47328,"title":"Telaprevir or boceprevir based therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection: development of resistance-associated variants in treatment failure.","abstract":"The use of triple-therapy, pegylated-interferon, ribavirin and either of the first generation hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors telaprevir or boceprevir, is the new standard of care for treating genotype 1 chronic HCV. Clinical trials have shown response rates of around 70-80%, but there is limited data from the use of this combination outside this setting. Through an expanded access programme, we treated 59 patients, treatment na√Øve and experienced, with triple therapy. Baseline factors predicting treatment response or failure during triple therapy phase were identified in 58 patients. Thirty seven (63.8%) of 58 patients had undetectable HCV RNA 12weeks after the end of treatment. Genotype 1a (p=0.053), null-response to previous treatment (p=0.034), the rate of viral load decline after 12weeks of previous interferon-based treatment (p=0.033) were all associated with triple-therapy failure. The most common cause of on-treatment failure for telaprevir-based regimens was the development of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) at amino acids 36 and/or 155 of HCV protease (p=0.027) whereas in boceprevir-based regimens mutations at amino acid 54 were significant (p=0.015). SVR12 rates approaching 64% were achieved using triple therapy outside the clinical trial setting, in a patient cohort that included cirrhotics.
