{"id":60694,"title":"A positive feedback regulation of ISL-1 in DLBCL but not in pancreatic ?-cells.","abstract":"Insulin enhancer binding protein-1 (ISL-1), a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, has been reported to play essential roles in promoting adult pancreatic ?-cells proliferation. Recent studies indicate that ISL-1 may also involve in the occurrence of a variety of tumors. However, whether ISL-1 has any functional effect on tumorigenesis, and what are the differences on ISL-1 function in distinct conditions, are completely unknown. In this study, we found that ISL-1 was highly expressed in human pancreatic ?-cells, as well as in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but to a much less extent in other normal tissues or tumor specimens. Further study revealed that ISL-1 promoted the proliferation of pancreatic ?-cells and DLBCL cells, and also accelerated the tumorigenesis of DLBCL in vivo. We also found that ISL-1 could activate c-Myc transcription not only in pancreatic ?-cells but also in DLBCL cells. However, a cell-specific feedback regulation was detectable only in DLBCL cells. This auto-regulatory loop was established by the interaction of ISL-1 and c-Myc to form an ISL-1/c-Myc transcriptional complex, and synergistically to promote ISL-1 transcription through binding on the ISL-1 promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrate a positive feedback regulation of ISL-1 in DLBCL but not in pancreatic ?-cells, which might result in the functional diversities of ISL-1 in different physiological and pathological processes.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845569","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.837165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Negative feedback","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Positive feedback","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enhancer (genetics)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.393917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.120615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Autoregulation","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregulation"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Turn (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
