{"id":80266,"title":"Novel metronidazole-chalcone conjugates with potential to counter drug resistance in Trichomonas vaginalis.","abstract":"Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent, curable sexually transmitted disease (STD), which increases risk of viral STDs and HIV. However, drug resistance has been developed by some strains of Trichomonas vaginalis against Metronidazole (MTZ), the FDA approved drug against trichomoniasis. In the present study twenty two chalcone hybrids of metronidazole have been synthesized in a quest to get new molecules with higher potential against metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis. All new hybrid molecules were found active against T. vaginalis with varying levels of activity against MTZ-susceptible and resistant strains. Eight compounds (4a, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4h, 4q and 4s) were found as active as the standard drug with an MIC of 1.56Â ?g/ml against MTZ-susceptible strain. However, compounds 4e, 4h and 4m were 4-times more active than MTZ against drug-resistant T. vaginalis, amongst which 4e and 4h were most promising against both susceptible and resistant strains.
