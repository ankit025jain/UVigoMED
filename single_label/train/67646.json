{"id":67646,"title":"Implications of serum creatinine measurements on GFR estimation and vancomycin dosing in children.","abstract":"Different serum creatinine (sCr) assays may obtain different values in the same patient, causing discrepancies in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and sCr-based vancomycin dosing calculations.To identify potential discrepancies in sCr concentrations obtained by different assays, the compensated Jaffe (sCr-Jaffe) and the enzymatic (sCr-enz), and to compare between the eGFR and vancomycin daily dose, based on these sCr values.sCr-Jaffe and, sCr-enz concentrations of 890 healthy children, aged 1-18 years, were available from the Canadian Laboratory Initiative in Pediatric Reference Intervals study in Ontario. For each subject, eGFR (eGFR-Jaffe, eGFR-enz) was calculated using the revised Schwartz equation, and vancomycin daily dose (Vdose-Jaffe, Vdose-enz) was calculated using a sCr-based pharmacokinetic model.Significant, age-related differences were found in sCr concentrations, and in subsequent eGFR and Vdose, between the two assays. In children aged 1-5 years, mean sCr-Jaffe was higher than sCr-enz (44.0?±?5.0 vs. 27.7?±?7.3??mol/L, P?<?0.001), leading to lower eGFR-Jaffe (83.2?±?9.0 vs. 137.9?±?27.1?mL/min/1.73m2, P?<?0.001) and lower Vdose-Jaffe (44.7?±?2.5 vs. 53.5?±?5.1?mg/kg/24?h, P?<?0.001).Based on these findings, young children may be at risk for vancomycin under-treatment. Further research is needed to define the more accurate sCr assay in young children treated with renally excreted drugs.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596064","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.549718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.471698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.442819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"927","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/927"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Jaffe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffe"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
