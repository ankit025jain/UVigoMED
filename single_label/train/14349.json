{"id":14349,"title":"Serotonin 1A receptor inhibits the status epilepticus induced by lithium-pilocarpine in rats.","abstract":"Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological emergency associated with a high mortality rate. The serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor is a possible target for the treatment of SE, but its role in animal models and the precise area of brain involved remain controversial. The hippocampus is a candidate site due to its key role in the development of SE and the existence of a high density of 5-HT1A receptors. Therefore, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous and intrahippocampal activation of 5-HT1A receptors in lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE, and tested whether the hippocampus is a true effector site. We developed SE in male Sprague-Dawley rats by giving lithium chloride (LiCl; 3 meq/kg, i.p.) 22-24 h prior to pilocarpine (25 mg/kg, i.p.), and found that 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist administered subcutaneously (s.c.) at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg 1 h before pilocarpine injection increased the latency to the first epileptiform spikes, the electrographic SE, and the behavioral generalized seizures (GS), while reducing the total EEG seizure time (P <0.01). The duration of GS was shortened only by 1.0 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT s.c. (P <0.05). All these effects were inhibited by combined administration of WAY-100635 (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) (P <0.05), an antagonist of the 5-HT1A receptor, but WAY-100635 alone and low doses of 8-OHDPAT (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) did not alter seizure activity. Furthermore, intrahippocampal 8-OH-DPAT only shortened the GS duration (P <0.05). These findings imply that the 5-HT1A receptor is a promising therapeutic target against the generation and propagation of SE, and hippocampal receptors are involved in reducing the seizure severity.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429728","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Status epilepticus","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_epilepticus"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Pilocarpine","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilocarpine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.482072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.480046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.362855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"5-HT1 receptor","weight":0.287221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1_receptor"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.266619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Seizure types","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure_types"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
