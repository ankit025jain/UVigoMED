{"id":25810,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in 325 consecutive patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","abstract":"Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provides detailed assessment of valve annulus and iliofemoral vessels in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients. However, data on diagnostic performance of MDCT coronary angiography (MDCT-CA) are scarce. The aim of the study is to assess diagnostic performance of MDCT for coronary artery evaluation before TAVR.A total of 325 consecutive patients (234 without previous myocardial revascularization, 49 with previous coronary stenting, and 42 with previous coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]) underwent invasive coronary angiography and MDCT before TAVR. MDCT-CA was performed using the same data set dedicated to standard MDCT aortic annulus evaluation. Multidetector computed tomography-CA evaluability and diagnostic accuracy in comparison with invasive coronary angiography as criterion standard were assessed.The MDCT-CA evaluability of native coronaries was 95.6%. The leading cause of unevaluability was beam-hardening artifact due to coronary calcifications. In a segment-based analysis, MDCT-CA showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy for detecting ?50% stenosis of 91%, 99.2%, 83.4%, 99.6% and 98.8%, respectively. The MDCT-CA evaluability of coronary stents was 82.1%. In a segment-based analysis, MDCT-CA showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for detecting ?50% in-stent restenosis of 94.1%, 86.7%, 66.7%, 98.1%, and 88.3%, respectively. All CABGs were correctly assessed by MDCT-CA. In a patient-based analysis, MDCT-CA showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 89.7%, 90.8%, 80.6%, 95.4%, and 90.5%, respectively.Multidetector computed tomography-CA allows to correctly rule out the presence of significant native coronary artery stenosis, significant in-stent restenosis, and CABG disease in patients referred for TAVR.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25173545","annotations":[{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.823655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.753898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.694297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.674475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.670767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.387471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.323482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"}]}
