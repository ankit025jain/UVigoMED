{"id":71352,"title":"Relationship of MDA plasma concentrations to long-term survival of breast cancer patients.","abstract":"Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a product of polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation. Changes in MDA concentrations have been found in patients with various types of cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of MDA plasma concentrations to the long-term survival of patients with breast cancer.We conducted a retrospective study which included 106 patients at various disease stages (I - n = 2; II - n = 30; III - n = 51; IV - n = 23). Plasma MDA concentrations were measured at the time of diagnosis. Study participants were divided into groups according to age (<55 years vs ?55 years), disease stage, and MDA concentration (<9 mmol/L vs ?9 mmol/L). Survival rates between groups were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.We found that higher MDA concentrations were associated with lower survival rates in stage I and II breast cancer. No significant association was found in patients with stage III and IV disease. Multivariate analysis showed that the MDA level was the only independent prognostic factor for patient survival in the total study group (hazard ratio 1.57, P = 0.03).MDA can be used as a prognostic factor in early stages of breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076247","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.68083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.582679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.464424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fatty acid","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Fatty acid metabolism","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_metabolism"}]}
