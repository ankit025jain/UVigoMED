{"id":11461,"title":"Virus excretion and antibody dynamics in goats inoculated with a field isolate of peste des petits ruminants virus.","abstract":"A field isolate of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) from an outbreak in Tibet, China, was inoculated into goats to investigate the dynamics of virus excretion and antibody production. Further, animals received PPRV vaccine strain Nigeria 75/1. Ocular, nasal and oral samples were tested for the presence of virus antigen by one-step real-time qualitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR); competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) was used for the measurement of specific antibodies against PPRV. Virus particles could be detected as early as day 3 post-inoculation (pi) and virus excretion lasted for up to day 26 pi. All four goats inoculated with the PPRV field isolate were seropositive as early as day 10 pi. In animals inoculated with the vaccine strain, antibody was detected at day 14 pi, and levels of neutralizing antibodies remained above the protection threshold level (1 : 8) for 8 months. Both virus particles and neutralizing antibodies were detected earlier in goats challenged with the field isolate than in those receiving the vaccine strain.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589103","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"China","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Tibet","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.580304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Bubonic plague","weight":0.505407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0760956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Ovine rinderpest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovine_rinderpest"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Pi","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Tibet Autonomous Region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet_Autonomous_Region"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Neutralisation (immunology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralisation_(immunology)"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"2011 Australian Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
