{"id":39521,"title":"A framework to develop nurses' liver care skills.","abstract":"Following the overview of liver disease in part 1, the second part of this series looks at how a new competency framework was developed for nurses caring for people with or at risk of liver disease to address the increasing burden of the disease across public health, primary care and secondary care. Understanding of liver disease and its risk factors remains poor among many health professionals; a competency framework enables nurses and teams to identify and develop the skills, knowledge and understanding they need to provide high-quality, person-centred care.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174134","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.606261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.275016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0972833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Competence (human resources)","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competence_(human_resources)"},{"name":"Secondary care","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_care"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"}]}
