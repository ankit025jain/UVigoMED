{"id":12426,"title":"IL-17A produced by ?? T cells promotes tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Interleukin (IL)-17A is expressed in the tumor microenvironment where it appears to contribute to tumor development, but its precise role in tumor immunity remains controversial. Here, we report mouse genetic evidence that IL-17A is critical for tumor growth. IL-17A-deficient mice exhibited reduced tumor growth, whereas systemic administration of recombinant mouse IL-17A promoted the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor-promoting effect of IL-17A was mediated through suppression of antitumor responses, especially CD8(+) T-cell responses. Furthermore, we found that IL-17A was produced mainly by V?4 ?? T cells, insofar as depleting V?4 ?? T cells reduced tumor growth, whereas adoptive transfer of V?4 ?? T cells promoted tumor growth. Mechanistic investigations showed that IL-17A induced CXCL5 production by tumor cells to enhance the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to tumor sites in a CXCL5/CXCR2-dependent manner. IL-17A also promoted the suppressive activity of MDSC to reinforce suppression of tumoral immunity. Moreover, we found that MDSC could induce IL-17A-producing ?? T cells via production of IL-1? and IL-23. Conversely, IL-17A could also enhance production of IL-1? and IL-23 in MDSC as a positive feedback. Together, our results revealed a novel mechanism involving cross-talk among ?? T cells, MDSCs, and tumor cells through IL-17A production. These findings offer new insights into how IL-17A influences tumor immunity, with potential implications for the development of tumor immunotherapy.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525743","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.791547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.786959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.728498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.66932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.654549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.481533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Positive feedback","weight":0.375104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Crosstalk (biology)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(biology)"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"CXCL5","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL5"},{"name":"CXC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Visual cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Suppressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor"},{"name":"Filmmaking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cancer immunology","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunology"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"New York State Route 17A","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_17A"},{"name":"Implications of nanotechnology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implications_of_nanotechnology"}]}
