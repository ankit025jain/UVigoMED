{"id":79500,"title":"Evaluation of malaria cases in individuals after traveling to endemic regions of the world.","abstract":"This study evaluates types of malaria and treatment success in a series of identified cases among individuals who were presumed to have travelled to regions where malaria is endemic.In Sema Hospital, 25 cases of malaria (5 in women, 20 in men) were diagnosed during the 6-year period between 2006 and 2012. The mean age of the patients was 34.5 years. Diagnoses were established with thick and thin peripheral blood smears that were parasite-positive. These tests were then compared to the rapid diagnostic test based on Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2.All cases demonstrated fever beginning with chills. Three patients had prophylaxis with doxycycline, but all stopped the prophylaxis early of their own volition. P. falciparum was the parasitic agent in all cases. A regimen of artemisinin and lumefantrine was administered in 18 of the 25 cases; quinine plus doxycycline was given in 3, and chloroquine was administered in the remaining 4. Usage of these regimens cured all cases of malaria without complications.The importance of prophylaxis of malaria was demonstrated. Malaria should also be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever that have a history of travel to endemic regions.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558579","annotations":[{"name":"Chloroquine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine"},{"name":"Quinine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine"},{"name":"Artemisinin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin"},{"name":"Doxycycline","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.795711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.756211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.727236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Chills","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lumefantrine","weight":0.644069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumefantrine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"}]}
