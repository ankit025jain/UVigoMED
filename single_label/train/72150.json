{"id":72150,"title":"Genkwadaphnin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells.","abstract":"Genkwadaphnin is a daphnane diterpene ester molecule isolated from the flower buds of Daphne genkwa. In the present study, we investigated the apoptosis-inducing effect of genkwadaphnin in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. Apoptosis was triggered in SCC12 cells following genkwadaphnin treatment in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Genkwadaphnin treatment increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Knockdown of JNK and p38 MAPK by recombinant adenovirus expressing microRNA (miR) resulted in significant inhibition of genkwadaphnin-induced apoptosis in SCC12 cells. Finally, pretreatment with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) markedly reduced SCC12 cell apoptosis, concomitant with significant inhibition of MAPK activation. These results indicate that genkwadaphnin has the potential to induce apoptosis in SCC cells, providing information on which to base further research with the aim of developing a cure for SCC.
