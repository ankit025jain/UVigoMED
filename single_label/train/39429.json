{"id":39429,"title":"Intussusception clinical pathway: a survey of pediatric surgery practices.","abstract":"Therapeutic reduction of intussusception by air or contrast enema may require surgery if the bowel is irreducible or perforates. There is no standard for the involvement of a pediatric surgeon in the workup of the condition. A regional survey of clinical practices was therefore undertaken to attempt to establish a consensus as to when the presence of a pediatric surgeon is required. Distributed to pediatric surgeons at 32 institutions, a questionnaire asked the process of imaging and reduction of infants with intussusception and the extent of pediatric surgical involvement. Surgeons at 29 institutions responded (91%). Ultrasound was used in diagnosis in 16 (55%), 13 (45%) requiring a positive ultrasound diagnosis of intussusception before attempting reduction. Three-fourths (22 [76%]) required surgeon notification that enema reduction was taking place, and one-fourth (seven [24%]) required prior surgical consultation. Only three (10%) required the presence of a surgery team member. Most (21 [72%]) did not demand one, and five (18%) indicated that surgical presence was desirable but not a necessity. There is no consensus for pediatric surgical involvement before and during reduction of an intussusception.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25197867","annotations":[{"name":"Enema","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatric surgery","weight":0.798998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_surgery"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.674738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.190311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Intussusception (medical disorder)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intussusception_(medical_disorder)"},{"name":"Medical school in the United Kingdom","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Clinical pathway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pathway"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Supply and demand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Notification system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_system"}]}
