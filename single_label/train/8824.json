{"id":8824,"title":"Reduced dendritic arborization and hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons in a Scn1b-based model of Dravet syndrome.","abstract":"Epileptic encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome, are severe treatment-resistant epilepsies with developmental regression. We examined a mouse model based on a human ?1 sodium channel subunit (Scn1b) mutation. Homozygous mutant mice shared phenotypic features and pharmaco-sensitivity with Dravet syndrome. Patch-clamp analysis showed that mutant subicular and layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons had increased action potential firing rates, presumably as a consequence of their increased input resistance. These changes were not seen in L5 or CA1 pyramidal neurons. This raised the concept of a regional seizure mechanism that was supported by data showing increased spontaneous synaptic activity in the subiculum but not CA1. Importantly, no changes in firing or synaptic properties of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons from mutant mice were observed, which is in contrast with Scn1a-based models of Dravet syndrome. Morphological analysis of subicular pyramidal neurons revealed reduced dendritic arborization. The antiepileptic drug retigabine, a K+ channel opener that reduces input resistance, dampened action potential firing and protected mutant mice from thermal seizures. These results suggest a novel mechanism of disease genesis in genetic epilepsy and demonstrate an effective mechanism-based treatment of the disease.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747835","annotations":[{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.793624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.76635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.716905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interneuron","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.558538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.471708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Pyramidal cell","weight":0.366629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.311627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Subiculum","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subiculum"},{"name":"Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy_with_febrile_seizures_plus"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Retigabine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retigabine"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Input impedance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_impedance"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
