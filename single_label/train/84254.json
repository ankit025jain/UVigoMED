{"id":84254,"title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of adrenal medullary hyperplasia].","abstract":"To explore the clinical characters of adrenal medullary hyperplasia (AMH).The clinical data of 7 cases of AMH admitted from 1996 to 2013 were analyzed with a review of literature.There were 3 males and 4 females with a median age of 36 (23-69) years. All had hypertension at first diagnosis and 2 were paroxysmal. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed unilateral adrenal nodule in all cases, including left (n = 5) and right (n = 2) side. The diameter of nodules was 0.9 cm to 3.0 cm.Hypokalemia was found in 2 cases. And 24-hour output of urine catecholamine was higher than normal level in 2 cases. An abnormal rise of 24-hour output of urine free cortisol was found in 1 case with a lower level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) simultaneously while a lower level of plasma renin activity in vertical position was found in another case. Three patients received (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scan and one had positive result. Pre-operative diagnosis included pheochromocytoma (n = 2), adrenocortical adenoma (n = 3) (2 aldosterone-producing adenomas, 1 Cushing adenoma) and undetermined adrenal tumor (n = 2). All underwent surgery, including unilateral adrenalectomy (n = 4) and resection of adrenal disease (n = 3). All cases had a pathologic diagnosis of AMH. One had concurrent Cushing adenoma while another with cortical hyperplasia.One case achieved normotension postoperatively while others showed varying decreases of blood pressure, but remained hypertensive.With a common feature of hypertension, AMH is difficult to diagnose preoperatively. CT scan has a certain diagnostic significance and a definite diagnosis depends on pathological examination; because of inaccurate preoperative and intraoperative diagnosis, the extent of surgery may be incomplete and results in unsatisfied outcomes.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142994","annotations":[{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Hypokalemia","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia"},{"name":"Adrenocortical adenoma","weight":0.879918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocortical_adenoma"},{"name":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.800967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.645769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Adrenal medulla","weight":0.591096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_medulla"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.576353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Adrenal tumor","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.502995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.473598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.436452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.435093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adrenalectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenalectomy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Harvey Williams Cushing","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Williams_Cushing"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"}]}
