{"id":33603,"title":"Steroid-free emollient formulations reduce symptoms of eczema and improve quality of life.","abstract":"Two over-the-counter products have been clinically tested for efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Study 1 evaluated a daily maintenance Body Cream (Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Cr√®me) applied twice daily for 14 days, followed by treatment withdrawal for 5 days (regression period) in subjects with a history of atopic dermatitis. Study 2 evaluated an acute treatment (Eucerin Eczema Relief Instant Therapy [Instant Therapy]) for active atopic dermatitis lesions administered for 14 days. Skin barrier function, hydration, tolerability, and relief of symptoms were assessed at baseline, day 7, and day 14. Study 2 also measured itch relief and treatment impact on work, social activities, and sleep. Body Cream significantly improved skin hydration and barrier function (P<.001) at 14 days, with improvements persisting through the 5-day regression phase. Itching was significantly improved in 93.8% of subjects (P<.001). Instant Therapy treatment of atopic dermatitis lesions significantly improved skin hydration and barrier function, as well as symptoms of erythema, pruritus, excoriation, and lichenification, with rapid improvement of itch reported within minutes of the first treatment application. Instant Therapy significantly reduced itch intensity and frequency, and demonstrated beneficial improvements in subjects' quality of life. Body Cream and Instant Therapy were both safe and well tolerated.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809884","annotations":[{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.6638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.648425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.256982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0849781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0180441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Barrier function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_function"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"2011 Australian Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open"},{"name":"Excoriation","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excoriation"}]}
