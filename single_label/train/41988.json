{"id":41988,"title":"Defective apoptosis in intestinal and mesenteric adipose tissue of Crohn's disease patients.","abstract":"Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with complex pathogenic pathways involving defects in apoptosis mechanisms. Recently, mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) has been associated with CD ethiopathology, since adipose thickening is detected close to the affected intestinal area. However, the potential role of altered apoptosis in MAT of CD has not been addressed.To evaluate apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa and MAT of patients with CD.Samples of intestinal mucosa and MAT from patients with ileocecal CD and from non-inflammatory bowel diseases patients (controls) were studied. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay and correlated with the adipocytes histological morphometric analysis. The transcriptional and protein analysis of selected genes and proteins related to apoptosis were determined.TUNEL assay showed fewer apoptotic cells in CD, when compared to the control groups, both in the intestinal mucosa and in MAT. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells (TUNEL) correlated significantly with the area and perimeter of the adipose cells in MAT. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis reveal a significantly lower transcript and protein levels of Bax in the intestinal mucosa of CD, compared to the controls; low protein levels of Bax were found localized in the lamina propria and not in the epithelium of this tissue. Furthermore, higher level of Bcl-2 and low level of Caspase 3 were seen in the MAT of CD patients.The defective apoptosis in MAT may explain the singular morphological characteristics of this tissue in CD, which may be implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887376","annotations":[{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.798446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.67403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.578368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.401002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.352377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.219691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hyperkeratosis","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkeratosis"},{"name":"Intestinal mucosa","weight":0.120688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_mucosa"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Caspase 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_3"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Monoamine transporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_transporter"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Ileocolic artery","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileocolic_artery"}]}
