{"id":61090,"title":"[CAL-101,a novel agent of targeted therapy in hematological malignancies].","abstract":"CAL-101 is a selective inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), it inhibits the survival, proliferation and migration of tumor cells by directly inducing apoptosis and inhibiting micro-environmental interactions. It has been determined that the P110? isoforms of PI3K expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic lineage, such as B and T cells. This review focuses on the target, mechanism of action, the use and prospect of CAL-101 in tumors of blood and lymph systems.
