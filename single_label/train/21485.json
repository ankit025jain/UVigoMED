{"id":21485,"title":"[Experience of two cases of tetanus without a clear history of trauma].","abstract":"Tetanus develops following inoculation of damaged human tissue with Clostridium tetani which transforms into a vegetative rod-shaped bacterium and produces the tetanospasmin. Usually we make a diagnosis of tetanus based on typical symptoms and history of trauma. But, when patients have no noticeable history of trauma, we have to diagnose tetanus on the basis of the clinical course and symptoms. We report herein on two cases of tetanus without a clear history of trauma. The first patient visited us with the chief complaints of pain in the neck and shoulder, and difficulty in opening the mouth. Based on these symptoms, we diagnosed tetani in the first stage and we started treatment, consisting mainly of human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin on the first day. The second patient also had typical symptoms of tetanus. However, he rejected the use of human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin on the first day. Because his symptoms worsened on the 2nd day, we insisted that he used it. On the 5th hospital day he developed partial opisthotonus of neck. However he recovered without tracheotomy or intratracheal intubation.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601099","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Tetanus","weight":0.814694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.650433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tetanospasmin","weight":0.136645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanospasmin"},{"name":"Clostridium tetani","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_tetani"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Opisthotonus","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthotonus"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Persistent vegetative state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_vegetative_state"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
