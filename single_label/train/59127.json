{"id":59127,"title":"Latinas' attitudes about cervical cancer prevention: a meta-synthesis.","abstract":"Latina women are almost twice as likely to die from cervical cancer as Caucasian women. In response to this disparity, qualitative study has been devoted to this topic. In order to generalize knowledge, insights gleaned through qualitative research methodology may be integrated through meta-synthesis, a methodology that has developed in nursing and related health sciences. The primary purpose of this meta-synthesis was to obtain information about Latinas' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding cervical cancer and its screening. After applying inclusion criteria, nine studies were located. Results were organized around four areas of inquiry that cross-cut primary studies: 1) Latina participants' knowledge of cervical cancer and its prevention; 2) barriers for regular cervical cancer screening; 3) facilitators that encouraged such screening; and 4) recommendations on how to provide screening for Latina women. Findings indicated that culturally appropriate education and improving accessibility to health care were the most important overall themes for future efforts to improve screening rates among Latinas in the United States.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855810","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.69745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.56581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.551409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.539055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.493674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.383031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Healthcare science","weight":0.32212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_science"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.162725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.132822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Inquiry","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0283361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"Latino (demonym)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_(demonym)"},{"name":"Hispanic and Latino Americans","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Crosscut saw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosscut_saw"},{"name":"Gleaning (birds)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Social integration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}]}
