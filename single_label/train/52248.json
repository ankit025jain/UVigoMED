{"id":52248,"title":"Immune complex formation in human diabetic retina enhances toxicity of oxidized LDL towards retinal capillary pericytes.","abstract":"Recently it has been shown that levels of circulating oxidized LDL immune complexes (ox-LDL-ICs) predict the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study aimed to investigate whether ox-LDL-ICs are actually present in the diabetic retina, and to define their effects on human retinal pericytes versus ox-LDL. In retinal sections from people with type 2 diabetes, costaining for ox-LDL and IgG was present, proportionate to DR severity, and detectable even in the absence of clinical DR. In contrast, no such staining was observed in retinas from nondiabetic subjects. In vitro, human retinal pericytes were treated with native LDL, ox-LDL, and ox-LDL-IC (0-200 mg protein/l), and measures of viability, receptor expression, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stresses, and cytokine secretion were evaluated. Ox-LDL-IC exhibited greater cytotoxicity than ox-LDL toward retinal pericytes. Acting through the scavenger (CD36) and IgG (CD64) receptors, low concentrations of ox-LDL-IC triggered apoptosis mediated by oxidative and ER stresses, and enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion. The data suggest that IC formation in the diabetic retina enhances the injurious effects of ox-LDL. These findings offer new insights into pathogenic mechanisms of DR, and may lead to new preventive measures and treatments.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616481","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.954531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Immune complex","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_complex"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.676137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.537436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.445704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.362795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Pericyte","weight":0.348478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericyte"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.346395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.218394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"CD36","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD36"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
