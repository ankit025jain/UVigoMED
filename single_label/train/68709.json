{"id":68709,"title":"Class I and II histone deacetylase inhibition by ITF2357 reduces SLE pathogenesis in vivo.","abstract":"We sought to determine if a specific class I and II HDAC inhibitor (ITF2357) was able to decrease disease in lupus-prone NZB/W mice through regulation of T cell profiles. From 22 to 38 weeks-of-age, NZB/W and non-lupus NZW mice were treated with ITF2357 (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg), or vehicle control. Body weight and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks, while sera anti-dsDNA and cytokine levels were measured every 4 weeks. Kidney disease was determined by sera IgG levels, immune complex deposition, and renal pathology. T lymphocyte profiles were assessed using flow cytometric analyses. Our results showed that NZB/W mice treated with the 10 mg/kgof ITF2357 had decreased renal disease and inflammatory cytokines in the sera. Treatment with ITF2357 decreased the Th17 phenotype while increasing the percentage of Tregs as well as Foxp3 acetylation. These results suggest that specific HDAC inhibition may decrease disease by altering T cell differentiation and acetylation.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503172","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.89194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.880394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Immune complex","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_complex"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.852738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.747825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.570522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.503562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase","weight":0.450772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.328571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.293514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.174576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"}]}
