{"id":63809,"title":"Phenotypic effect of ?-globin gene numbers on Indian sickle ?-thalassemia patients.","abstract":"Sickle cell ?-thalassemia is a compound heterozygous state of ?-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Patient with these conditions showed mild-to-severe clinical phenotype.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ?-globin gene numbers on the phenotype of sickle cell ?-thalassemia patients.Seventy-five sickle cell ?-thalassemia patients were characterized. Clinical, hematological, and molecular characterization was performed in all subjects. Amplified refectory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was applied for ?-thalassemia mutation study while ?-genotyping was conducted by Gap-PCR.Highest frequency of IVS1-5 (33 out of 75 patients) ?-thalassemia genotype was recorded. Twenty-eight patients were reported with ?-globin chain deletion while four had ?-triplications (Anti ?-3.7kb). Sickle ?-thalassemia patients with ?-chain deletions ameliorate hematological and clinical variables.This study indicates that the coexistence of ?-globin chain deletions showed mild phenotype instead of absence of ?-chain deletions while the patients with triplication of ?-genes express severe phenotype.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395608","annotations":[{"name":"Sickle-cell disease","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease"},{"name":"Thalassemia","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassemia"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.830605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Compound heterozygosity","weight":0.746663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_heterozygosity"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Globin","weight":0.613233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Sickle","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}]}
