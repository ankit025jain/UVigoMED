{"id":23384,"title":"Post-operative surgical-site infection from skin bleaching: a case report.","abstract":"Prolonged application of steroid containing cream can pose a serious challenge to users. Apart from making the skin lighter it creates a spectrum of diseases in those that use them as the adrenal glands are suppressed and are unable to secrete more steroids when required.The objective is to report on a patient who presented with severe sepsis after a long period of application of steroids to the skin.A patient who has applied steroids to the skin over a prolonged period was followed up during treatment to ascertain the complications that the patient sustained during the period of treatment.The patient was found to have developed a pelvic induration without abscess. She also had a large anterior abdominal wall abscess superficial to the external oblique muscle extending towards the left flank.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488289","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.742266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.496006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.33836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.118155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Skin whitening","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_whitening"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abdominal internal oblique muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_internal_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Cream (pharmaceutical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(pharmaceutical)"},{"name":"Abdominal external oblique muscle","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_external_oblique_muscle"}]}
