{"id":42497,"title":"Evaluation of tumor microvascular response to brivanib by dynamic contrast-enhanced 7-T MRI in an orthotopic xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to evaluate the antiangiogenic effects of brivanib using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in an orthotopic mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).With human HCC (HepG2 cell line) orthotopic nude mouse xenografts, brivanib was administered orally to the treatment group, and the vehicle was administered to the control group for 14 days. DCE-MRI was performed before the start of the therapy and 7 and 14 days after the start of therapy. Treatment-induced changes in tumor volume and microvessel density (MVD) assessed by CD31 immunohistochemistry were analyzed. Perfusion parameters, including volume transfer constant between blood plasma and extravascular extracellular space (K(trans)), fractional extravascular extracellular space per unit volume of tissue (ve), and rate constant between extravascular extracellular space and blood plasma (Kep), were calculated using the two-compartment model.Brivanib shows potent antitumor activity in tumor volume. The mean (± SD) MVD of the tumors was statistically significantly lower in the brivanib-treated group (40.8 ± 17.3 vessels/field) than in the control group (55.2 ± 9.05 vessels/field) (p < 0.05). In the control group, the K(trans) value increased statistically significantly between the baseline and 14 days after treatment (p = 0.048). In the brivanib-treated group, the K(trans) and ve values decreased statistically significantly between baseline and 7 days after treatment (p = 0.024 and p = 0.031, respectively) and between baseline and 14 days after treatment (p = 0.043 and p = 0.018, respectively). The difference between the K(trans) and ve values between baseline and 14 days after treatment showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.004 and p = 0.034, respectively).DCE-MRI is feasible in the orthotopic mouse model of human HCC, and it can noninvasively monitor brivanib-induced changes in tumor microvasculature.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848850","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.62066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.476917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.235094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0621111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Reaction rate constant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_rate_constant"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
