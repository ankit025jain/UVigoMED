{"id":85807,"title":"Management of pulmonary oligometastases by stereotactic body radiotherapy.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and effectiveness of active breathing control-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy in the management of pulmonary oligometastases.Between June 2010 and June 2012, 20 patients (13 males, 7 females) with 31 pulmonary metastases referred to the Department of Radiation Oncology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy were treated using active breathing control-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were used in the assessment of treatment response and toxicity, respectively.Assessment of treatment response revealed complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 30%, 25%, 30%, and 15% of the patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 14 months, local control was 85% and overall survival was 70%, with negligible treatment-related toxicity.Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and effective in the management of pulmonary oligometastases. It offers favorable treatment outcomes as a viable non-invasive therapeutic modality.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852862","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.649945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.625804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.552934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.374684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.318934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Coordinated Incident Management System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Incident_Management_System"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Military Medical Academy (Serbia)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medical_Academy_(Serbia)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Negligible","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
