{"id":69571,"title":"Pre-end-stage renal disease care not associated with dialysis facility neighborhood poverty in the United States.","abstract":"Receipt of nephrology care prior to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a strong predictor of decreased mortality and morbidity, and neighborhood poverty may influence access to care. Our objective was to examine whether neighborhood poverty is associated with lack of pre-ESRD care at dialysis facilities.In a multi-level ecological study using geospatially linked 2007-2010 Dialysis Facility Report and 2006-2010 American Community Survey data, we examined whether high neighborhood poverty (?20% of households in census tract living below poverty) was associated with dialysis facility-level lack of pre-ESRD care (percentage of patients with no nephrology care prior to dialysis start) in mixed-effects models, adjusting for facility and neighborhood confounders and allowing for neighborhood and regional random effects.Among the 5,184 facilities examined, 1,778 (34.3%) were located in a high-poverty area. Lack of pre-ESRD care was similar in poverty areas (30.8%) and other neighborhoods (29.6%). With adjustment, the absolute increase in percentage of patients at a facility with no pre-ESRD care associated with facility location in a poverty area versus other neighborhood was only 0.08% (95% CI -1.32, 1.47; p = 0.9). Potential effect modification by race and income inequality was detected.Despite previously reported detrimental effects of neighborhood poverty on health, facility neighborhood poverty was not associated with receipt of pre-ESRD care, suggesting no need to target interventions to increase access to pre-ESRD care at facilities in poorer geographic areas.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434854","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.714429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.662569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.585271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.543704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.427237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.263785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Census tract","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract"},{"name":"American Community Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey"},{"name":"Facility location","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location"},{"name":"Poverty in the United States","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"778","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/778"},{"name":"Autocracy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy"},{"name":"Food web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web"},{"name":"Neighbourhood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
