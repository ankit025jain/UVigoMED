{"id":63391,"title":"Predictors of outcome in adults with BCR-ABL negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with a pediatric-based regimen.","abstract":"We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 156 adults age 17-60 with BCR-ABL negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with a pediatric-inspired protocol. The CR rate was 93%; 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were 66% and 70%, respectively. Age <34 years and low presenting WBC were independent predictors of favorable OS (p<0.0001). The 5 year OS of patients age <34 and 34-60 presenting with a low WBC were 85% and 57%, respectively; the 5 year OS for those presenting with a high WBC were 57% and 30%, respectively. Cytogenetics and phenotype were not independent predictors of OS.
