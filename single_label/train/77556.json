{"id":77556,"title":"Skin symptoms in the construction industry: occurrence and determinants.","abstract":"In the construction industry, a relatively high hand eczema prevalence can be expected due to exposure to irritating and allergenic agents.As part of a regular program of voluntary medical examinations, a questionnaire including items on health symptoms and working circumstances is administered to construction industry personnel. We studied 152,200 male workers (response rate 52%). Associations between possible risk factors and self-reported skin symptoms and skin hypersensitivity were assessed using log-binomial regression analysis.Prevalence of skin symptoms on the hands was 25.4% among construction workers, 14.6% among office personnel. Nuisance due to dust exposure was the most important work-related determinant for skin symptoms [Prevalence Ratio (PR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.55-1.63]. Cross-sectional findings were supported by longitudinal analyses in a study population subset.Skin symptoms are common among construction workers. Nuisance due to dust exposure was associated with higher prevalences of skin symptoms.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619740","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.785997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.748817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.440243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.069656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Nuisance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Glossary of poker terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_poker_terms"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
