{"id":83550,"title":"[The role of VEGF, HSP-70 and protein S-100B in the potentiation effect of the neuroprotective effect of hypercapnic hypoxia].","abstract":"Studied the role of VEGF, HSP-70 and S-100B in potentiating hypercapnia neuroprotective effect of hypoxia. Demonstrated that neuroprotective effects when exposed hypercapnic hypoxia-mediated protein synthesis increased S-100B, mainly due to the action of carbon dioxide, and not oxygen deficiency. Neuroprotective effects of HSP-70 due to hypoxia, but the combined effect of hypoxia and hypercapnia gives a significant increase in the synthesis of HSP-70 in comparison with the isolated effect of hypoxia. Vascularization activated equally as hypoxia and hypercapnia, without adding significant effects in combination. This suggests dominant effect hypercapnia, hypoxia compared in neuroprotection mechanisms related to protein S-100B, but not the protein VEGF, hypercapnia and potentiate the neuroprotective efficacy of hypoxia-related protein HSP-70.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318158","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Protein biosynthesis","weight":0.772901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.663321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.448417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Hypercapnia","weight":0.441983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercapnia"},{"name":"Protein S","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_S"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Hsp70","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp70"},{"name":"S100B","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S100B"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"}]}
