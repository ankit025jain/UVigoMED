{"id":85370,"title":"H?S protecting against lung injury following limb ischemia-reperfusion by alleviating inflammation and water transport abnormality in rats.","abstract":"To investigate the effect of H?S on lower limb ischemia-reperfusion (LIR) induced lung injury and explore the underlying mechanism.Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group, IR group, IR+ Sodium Hydrosulphide (NaHS) group and IR+ DL-propargylglycine (PPG) group. IR group as lung injury model induced by LIR were given 4 h reperfusion following 4 h ischemia of bilateral hindlimbs with rubber bands. NaHS (0.78 mg/kg) as exogenous H?S donor and PPG (60 mg/kg) which can suppress endogenous H?S production were administrated before LIR, respectively. The lungs were removed for histologic analysis, the determination of wet-to-dry weight ratios and the measurement of mRNA and protein levels of aquaporin-1 (AQP?), aquaporin-5 (AQP?) as indexes of water transport abnormality, and mRNA and protein levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR?), myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88) and p-NF-?B as indexes of inflammation.LIR induced lung injury was accompanied with upregulation of TLR?-Myd88-NF-?B pathway and downregulation of AQP1/AQP?. NaHS pre-treatment reduced lung injury with increasing AQP?/AQP? expression and inhibition of TLR?-Myd88-NF-?B pathway, but PPG adjusted AQP?/AQP? and TLR4 pathway to the opposite side and exacerbated lung injury.Endogenous H?S, TLR?-Myd88-NF-?B pathway and AQP?/AQP? were involved in LIR induced lung injury. Increased H?S would alleviate lung injury and the effect is at least partially depend on the adjustment of TLR?-Myd88-NF-?B pathway and AQP?/AQP? expression to reduce inflammatory reaction and lessen pulmonary edema.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961850","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary
