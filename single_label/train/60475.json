{"id":60475,"title":"Association between the delta estimated glomerular filtration rate and the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance in Korean males.","abstract":"We investigated the association between the reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in Korean males.We enrolled 723 healthy Korean males. Serum creatinine concentration, serum electrophoresis, serum immunofixation, and the serum free light chain assay were performed. We calculated delta eGFR per year (?eGFR/yr). The prevalence of MGUS was compared based on the ?eGFR/yr and age group.Thirteen (1.8%) of 723 participants exhibited the monoclonal band on serum immunofixation. Prevalence of MGUS by age group was 0.00% (0/172 for 40 years), 1.63% (6/367 for 60 years), and 3.80% (7/184 for >60 years). The median decrease in ?eGFR/yr was 5.3%. The prevalence of MGUS in participants in their 50s with >5.3% decline in ?eGFR/yr was significantly higher than those with <5.3% decrease in ?eGFR/yr (3.16% versus 0.00%; P = 0.049). The prevalence of MGUS in participants in their 50s with >5.3% decrease in ?eGFR/yr was similar to that of healthy males in their 60s.Using the rate of reduction in ?eGFR/yr in healthy Korean males who had their serum creatinine level checked regularly may increase the MGUS detection rate in clinical practice.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895568","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.739173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.5572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.541905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.456024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.364317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Serum protein electrophoresis","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"723","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/723"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"River delta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
