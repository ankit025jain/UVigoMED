{"id":68831,"title":"Response to clopidogrel and its association with chronic kidney disease in noncardiogenic ischemic stroke patients.","abstract":"Noncardiogenic ischemic stroke patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have a greater rate of ischemic stroke recurrence than those without. Although clopidogrel is often used to prevent the recurrence of noncardiogenic ischemic stroke, the relationship between the response to clopidogrel and CKD is unclear. In the present study, the relationship between the response to clopidogrel and the presence of CKD was investigated in noncardiogenic ischemic stroke patients.A total of 129 noncardiogenic ischemic stroke patients receiving 75 mg/day of clopidogrel for ?1 week were evaluated. The VerifyNow P2Y12 Assay was used to measure the level of platelet aggregation induced by 20 ?M of adenosine diphosphate, and the degree of platelet aggregation and frequency of clopidogrel resistance were compared between 34 patients with CKD and 95 patients without CKD. Clopidogrel resistance was defined as a P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) value of >230 and/or % inhibition <20%.The PRU value was 201.9±91.3 in the patients with CKD and 163.3±86.4 in the patients without CKD (p=0.035). The frequency of a PRU value of >230 was 44.1% (15 patients) among the patients with CKD and 17.9% (17 patients) among those without CKD (p=0.002). The percent inhibition was 29.9%±28.1% among the patients with CKD and 41.1%±28.0% among the patients without CKD (p=0.030). The frequency of % inhibition <20% was 47.1% (16 patients) among the patients with CKD and 26.3% (25 patients) among those without CKD (p=0.026).The present study showed that noncardiogenic ischemic stroke patients with CKD have a greater frequency of clopidogrel resistance, thus suggesting that the response to clopidogrel is diminished in these patients.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492689","annotations":[{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Adenosine diphosphate","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.809645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.656852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.654905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.439832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Platelet aggregation","weight":0.321201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation"},{"name":"P2Y12","weight":0.269884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2Y12"},{"name":"P2Y receptor","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2Y_receptor"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0310801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Members of the 3rd Scottish Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_3rd_Scottish_Parliament"},{"name":"Toyota Y engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Y_engine"},{"name":"44,100 Hz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"}]}
