{"id":90732,"title":"Use of three-dimensional fluoroscopy to determine intra-articular screw penetration in proximal humeral fracture model.","abstract":"Proximal humeral locking plates have significantly improved the treatment of proximal humeral fractures in recent years; however, they are not devoid of complications. Inadvertent screw penetration into the joint is a well-documented complication. Intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) imaging may assist in detecting intra-articular implant penetration. This study compared the performance of a standard C-arm fluoroscope with a novel 3D imaging fluoroscope in detecting penetrating implants in a proximal humeral fracture model.Zinc-sprayed proximal humerus sawbones were affixed with a proximal humeral locking plate. Six different constructs were assembled. In each specimen, 1 screw, 2 screws, or no screws were inserted 2-mm proud of the articular surface. Each specimen was imaged with a conventional fluoroscope and a 3D imaging fluoroscope. Overall, 36 image sets were prepared for each modality. These were evaluated by 2 fellowship-trained surgeons for intraobserver and interobserver reliability as well for the accuracy of detecting prominent implants in the 2 imaging methods.Overall accuracy for observer A was 89.9% compared with 100% for C-arm fluoroscopy and 3D imaging fluoroscopy (P < .01) and for observer B was 91.1% and 100% (P = .01), respectively. The ? values were 0.74 with C-arm fluoroscopy and 1.0 for the 3D imaging fluoroscopy for observer A, and 0.93 and 1.0, respectively, for observer B.In a proximal humeral fracture model, C-arm fluoroscopy is a highly accurate imaging modality that can minimize the incidence of penetrating screws into the joint. Further clinical studies are required to establish this modality.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581875","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.924562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.74978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.686488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.655185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.615129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.340822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.198759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Disk image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
