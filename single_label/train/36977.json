{"id":36977,"title":"Endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus of prematurity.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the role of endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) in the management of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus of prematurity (PHHP) and to analyze which factors affect patient outcomes.This study retrospectively reviewed medical records of 27 premature infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and hydrocephalus treated with ETV and CPC from 2008 to 2011. All patients were evaluated using MRI before the procedure to verify the anatomical feasibility of ETV/CPC. Endoscopic treatment included third ventriculostomy, septostomy, and bilateral CPC. After ETV/CPC, all patients underwent follow-up for a period of 6-40 months (mean 16.2 months). The procedure was considered a failure if the patient subsequently required a shunt. The following factors were analyzed to determine a relationship to patient outcomes: gestational age at birth, corrected age and weight at surgery, timing of surgery after birth, grade of IVH, the status of the prepontine cistern and cerebral aqueduct on MRI, need for a ventricular access device prior to the endoscopic procedure, and scarring of the prepontine cistern noted at surgery.Seventeen (63%) of 27 patients required a shunt after ETV/CPC, and 10 patients did not require further CSF diversion. Several factors studied were associated with a higher rate of ETV/CPC failure: Grade IV hemorrhage, weight 3 kg or less and age younger than 3 months at the time of surgery, need for reservoir placement, and presence of a normal cerebral aqueduct. Two factors were found to be statistically significant: the patient's corrected gestational age of less than 0 weeks at surgery and a narrow prepontine cistern on MRI. The majority (83%) of ETV/CPC failures occurred in the first 3 months after the procedure. None of the patients had a complication directly related to the procedure.Endoscopic third ventriculostomy/CPC is a safe initial procedure for hydrocephalus in premature infants with IVH and hydrocephalus, obviating the need for a shunt in selected patients. Even though the success rate is low (37%), the lower rate of complications in comparison with shunt treatment may justify this procedure in the initial management of hydrocephalus. As several of the studied factors have shown influence on the outcome, patient selection based on these observations might increase the success rate.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527862","annotations":[{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Choroid plexus","weight":0.670417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid_plexus"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.651464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.626297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.621707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.621664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cauterization","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.416595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.390073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.387117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Cerebral aqueduct","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_aqueduct"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Aqueduct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct"},{"name":"Cistern","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistern"},{"name":"Ventriculostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriculostomy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Brachial plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
