{"id":65644,"title":"Urinary excretion of liver-type FABP as a new clinical marker for the progression of obstructive nephropathy.","abstract":"The aim of this article was to investigate the performance and predictive value of urinary liver-type FABP (uL-FABP) and urinary NGAL (uNGAL) for renal function and prognosis in obstructive nephropathy (ON).A total of 108 ON patients and urine samples were collected. An ELISA was used to determine the uL-FABP and uNGAL levels. A total of 90 patients completed the 1-year follow-up and were used to evaluate the predictive value of uL-FABP and uNGAL for the renal prognosis in ON.During the 1-year renal function follow-up, the uL-FABP level was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. When the preoperative uL-FABP and uNGAL or 72-h postoperative uL-FABP and uNGAL levels were combined, the areas under the curve for renal prognosis were 0.968 and 0.952, respectively.uL-FABP was helpful for the prediction of renal prognosis in ON. The combination of uL-FABP and uNGAL increased the accuracy of prediction.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796620","annotations":[{"name":"Urine","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.665101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.545467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.508151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.330623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.301218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.194725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"952","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/952"},{"name":"968","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/968"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
