{"id":71246,"title":"Prospects for personalized targeted therapies for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Targeted therapies for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remain limited. Extensive genetic heterogeneity complicates a robust molecular characterization of the evolution of cSCC. Nonetheless, potential targeted therapies for this cancer are under investigation, including the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which may yield promising results. In addition, the emergence of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and vaccine-based methods may provide novel treatment strategies for cSCC that are tailored to the individual patient. Ultimately, a combination of such methods may yield a multi-pronged targeted approach to personalize the treatment of cSCC.
