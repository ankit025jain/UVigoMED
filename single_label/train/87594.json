{"id":87594,"title":"Estimated incidence of cardiac contusion using transthoracic echocardiography in patients suffering from severe blunt trauma to the chest.","abstract":"Cardiac contusion (CC) is a known complication of blunt trauma to the chest. There have been debates about its true incidence and there are different reports which claim that it occurs in less than 10% to more than 70% of patients. The goal of this study is to estimate the incidence of CC in patients with severe blunt chest trauma (SBCT) using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).After defining inclusion and exclusion criteria, all cases with clinical evidences of SBCT from February 2010 until October 2011 were included in this study. Patients were assessed using electrocardiography (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Transient echocardiographic changes, including wall motion abnormalities, valvular or papillary muscle dysfunction, pericardial effusion or tamponade, free wall rupture and interatrial/interventricular septum defects, were considered to be abnormal and trauma-related.A total of 210 patients were assessed for CC. Fifty-two trauma-related echocardiographic changes in 47 patients were observed, in which 34 cases had simultaneous transient ECG changes. The estimated incidence of CC in these subjects was calculated to be 23.38% and 16.19%, respectively. There was a statistically significant relationship between the presence of both echocardiographic changes and ECG abnormalities, and those subjects without ECG changes (P = 0.03). As we evaluated stable patients without any cardiac-related clinical manifestations and TTE was chosen as our diagnostic modality, we claim that the true incidence must be higher.We believe that a comparison of our findings with those presented in the literature shows that the actual incidence of CC in blunt chest trauma is underestimated.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073207","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.735475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.715967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.70427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Pericardial effusion","weight":0.641708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_effusion"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.634643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.517546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.434006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.388488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.359499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Papillary muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_muscle"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Transient (oscillation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_(oscillation)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"Toyota Motorsport GmbH","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Motorsport_GmbH"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
