{"id":40284,"title":"Elevation of PRKCDBP, a novel transcriptional target of TNF-?, and its downregulation by infliximab in patients with ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"Protein kinase C delta binding protein (PRKCDBP/Cavin3/hSRBC) is a putative tumor suppressor that is downregulated in many human cancers. Recently, PRKCDBP was identified to be activated by nuclear factor-?B in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?.To explore the potential of PRKCDBP as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for inflammatory bowel disease, the possible correlation between its expression status and TNF-? signaling was evaluated in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, both pre- and post-infliximab (IFX) therapy.In total, 31 IFX therapy-na√Øve patients (13 females; median age, 41 years) with moderate-to-severe UC who had been scheduled for IFX treatment were included. Immunohistochemical analysis of TNF-? and PRKCDBP expression was performed in rectal biopsies.A significant correlation was observed in immunoreactivity between TNF-? and PRKCDBP. IFX therapy reduced immunohistochemical expression of PRKCDBP and TNF-? (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). The mean PRKCDBP expression level decreased from 54.5 to 30.2%, and that of TNF-? decreased from 54.5 to 36.2%. The immunohistochemical expression pre- and post-PRKCDBP therapy correlated significantly with TNF-? levels pre- and post-therapy (Spearman's rank correlation test; P = 0.005 and P = 0.001, respectively).These results demonstrate that mucosal expression of PRKCDBP correlated strongly with TNF-? expression in UC patients and that IFX therapy resulted in profound reductions in both PRKCDBP and TNF-?. Thus, these findings support that PRKCDBP expression is tightly controlled by TNF-?, and the anti-inflammatory effect of IFX may in part stem from blockade of the TNF-?-PRKCDBP signaling pathway.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Digestive System
