{"id":4360,"title":"[Effect of Parasep® feces centrifuge tube method on detecting schistosome eggs].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of the Parasep® feces centrifuge tube method on detecting schistosome eggs.A total of 803 residents aged from 6-65 years were selected in 2 schistosomiasis endemic villages, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, and their stool samples were collected and detected parallelly by the Kato-Katz technique, nylon silk egg hatching method, and Parasep® feces centrifuge tube method at the same time.Among the 803 people, 15 cases were found of schistosome egg positive, and the positive rate was 1.87%. The positive rates of the Kato-Katz technique, nylon silk egg hatching method, and Parasep® feces centrifuge tube method were 0.75%, 1.49% and 1.12%, respectively. The schistosome eggs got with the Parasep® feces centrifuge tube method were clear and easy to identify.In low endemic areas of schistosomiasis, the Parasep® feces centrifuge tube method can be used as schistosomiasis japonica etiology diagnosis method.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434145","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.750789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.731776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Silk","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Nylon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon"},{"name":"Centrifuge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge"},{"name":"Jiangling County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangling_County"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"803","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/803"},{"name":"Series and parallel circuits","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits"},{"name":"Japanese rice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rice"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hatching system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching_system"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"}]}
