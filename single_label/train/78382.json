{"id":78382,"title":"[Sinonasal inverted papilloma: our experiences of diagnostic and surgical care in Côte d'Ivoire].","abstract":"To present our experience of the diagnostic and surgical care of sino-nasal inverted papilloma.Retrospective study over 14 years (1996-2010) realised in the ENT departments in Côte d'Ivoire. Thirteen inverted papilloma confirmed and operated, after computed tomography, were included (7 men and 6 women, from 8 to 55 years old).The nasal obstruction was the main symptom. Twelve inverted papilloma correspond to Krouse stage T3, and 1 case T4. Surgical removal was performed by lateral rhinotomy (8 cases), Caldwell-Luc (4 cases) and De Lima (1 case). Squamous cell carcinoma was associated in 1 case. Recurrence with malignant transformation was observed in 1 case.Surgery by external approach allowed to obtaining satisfactory results. It stays of current events in our countries under equipped. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen must be compulsory.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683835","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.818326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.759091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.696914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.505656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.50565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.371262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.34725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.274145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Lima","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0193731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"News","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Compulsory education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education"}]}
