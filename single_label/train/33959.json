{"id":33959,"title":"Partial agenesis of corpus callosum--case study.","abstract":"Agenesis of the corpus callosum is an uncommon cerebral malformation usually of unknown etiology. It can be associated with other brain abnormalities, such as ventriculomegaly, or in combination with problems with other organs, such as congenital heart defect, as well as with chromosome anomalies. Diagnosis of this rare anomaly is important not only because of possible association with other developmental anomalies but also because of postnatal treatment and evaluation of children with this disorder. This paper presents prenatal diagnosis of partial agenesis of the posterior part of corpus callosum of a fetus detected in gestational week 33 by ultrasonography as an isolated developmental disorder, i.e., not accompanied by other morphological anomalies of the fetus or chromosome aberrations or other genetic defects.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779261","annotations":[{"name":"Agenesis of the corpus callosum","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenesis_of_the_corpus_callosum"},{"name":"Corpus callosum","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Agenesis","weight":0.670004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenesis"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.308836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Developmental disorder","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ventriculomegaly","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriculomegaly"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}]}
