{"id":78699,"title":"Effect of urban particles on human middle ear epithelial cells.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxic effect and inflammatory response of human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEECs) induced by urban particles (UP).Cell viability following UP exposure was assessed in HMEECs using the CCK 8 assay. The expression levels of the inflammation-related genes (COX-2 and MUC5AC) were analyzed using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and COX-2 production was analyzed using western blotting.Treatment with UP decreased cell viability in HMEECs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. UP exposure induced the significantly increased expression of COX-2 and MUC5AC. Western blotting showed dose dependently increased expression of COX-2 production.UP decreased cell viability, increased the inflammatory response, and increased mucin gene production in HMEECs. These findings indicate that exposure to UP can contribute to the development of otitis media.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598137","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.714275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.681035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.41458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.213413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.175428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Munich Airport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Airport"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
