{"id":81726,"title":"Modified schirmer test--a screening tool for xerostomia among subjects on antidepressants.","abstract":"The aim of the present study is to assess salivary flow rate in the subjects who were on antidepressant medications and its comparison with healthy controls and assessment of unstimulated salivary flow rate by modified Schirmer test (MST) and volumetric method (spitting method) for evaluation of xerostomia and whether any correlation exists between two methods.Thirty subjects who were on antidepressants were divided into two groups: tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective sertonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) of 15 each, compared with 30 age and gender matched controls. Unstimulated salivary flow rate was measured by both MST and spitting method.The unstimulated salivary flow rate measured by MST at the end of 3rd minute was 13.7 ± 10.08, 19.86 ± 8.95 and 31.0 ± 5.4 mm and by spitting method was 0.12 ± 0.07, 0.19 ± 0.10 and 0.30 ± 0.75 ml/min in TCA, SSRI and controls respectively (p<0.001). The Pearson correlation coefficient of r=0.85 shows excellent correlation between the two screening tests. Sensitivity and Specificity of MST was 90.9% and 31.5%.Salivary flow rate was less in antidepressant subjects when compared to the healthy controls. Results of the present study showed an excellent correlation excellent correlation between the two screening tests which suggests that MST can be routinely used as chair-side screening tool to evaluate hyposalivation which is time saving, patient friendly and specific of salivary secretions.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859769","annotations":[{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.802221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.678527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Tricyclic antidepressant","weight":0.601246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.589409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.423578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.300212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.242983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Schirmer's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schirmer's_test"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Exhibition game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"},{"name":"Spitting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"G.
