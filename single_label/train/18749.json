{"id":18749,"title":"A rapid two-step algorithm detects and identifies clinical macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in clinical bacterial isolates.","abstract":"Aiming to identify macrolide and beta-lactam resistance in clinical bacterial isolates rapidly and accurately, a two-step algorithm was developed based on detection of eight antibiotic resistance genes.Targeting at genes linked to bacterial macrolide (msrA, ermA, ermB, and ermC) and beta-lactam (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-9) antibiotic resistances, this method includes a multiplex real-time PCR, a melting temperature profile analysis as well as a liquid bead microarray assay. Liquid bead microarray assay is applied only when indistinguishable Tm profile is observed.The clinical validity of this method was assessed on clinical bacterial isolates. Among the total 580 isolates that were determined by our diagnostic method, 75% of them were identified by the multiplex real-time PCR with melting temperature analysis alone, while the remaining 25% required both multiplex real-time PCR with melting temperature analysis and liquid bead microarray assay for identification. Compared with the traditional phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test, an overall agreement of 81.2% (kappa=0.614, 95% CI=0.550-0.679) was observed, with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.7% and 73% respectively. Besides, the average test turnaround time is 3.9h, which is much shorter in comparison with more than 24h for the traditional phenotypic tests.Having the advantages of the shorter operating time and comparable high sensitivity and specificity with the traditional phenotypic test, our two-step algorithm provides an efficient tool for rapid determination of macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotic resistances in clinical bacterial isolates.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769404","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.7489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.595191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.475206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.300781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.173806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Multiplex (assay)","weight":0.0809308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_(assay)"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"679","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/679"},{"name":"580","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/580"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Turnaround (filmmaking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"Chiropractic treatment techniques","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_treatment_techniques"},{"name":"Thermal profiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_profiling"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Kappa (folklore)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)"},{"name":"Melting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Minuscule 614","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_614"}]}
