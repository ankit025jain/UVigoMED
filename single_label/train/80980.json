{"id":80980,"title":"[Analysis of malaria situation in Quanzhou City, 1963-2012].","abstract":"To understand the situation of malaria in Quanzhou City for 50 years, so as to provide the evidence for eliminating malaria.The data of epidemic situation of malaria and intermediary surveillance were collected and analyzed statistically from 1963 to 2012.The incidence of malaria has been periodically increased, but seasonal distribution was not obvious. The incidence in economically developed areas was significantly lower than that in the slow economic development areas. The patients were mainly young adults, and the careers were mainly the farmer, worker and migrant worker. The vivax malaria was the main type and the main vector was Anopheles minimus. The incidence of malaria has been less than 1/100,000 since 1997. From 2004, all of the patients were imported, mainly came from Africa and Southeast Asia.After more than 50 years' comprehensive prevention and treatment, the incidence of malaria has been maintained at a low level. We should strengthen the control and management of imported malaria, and consolidate the achievements in malaria prevention, so as to achieve the aim of malaria elimination.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490368","annotations":[{"name":"Migrant worker","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.777841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.754165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Economic development","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.595057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.532809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.266338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.130256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0635026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Quanzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.0289014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"1963","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963"},{"name":"1100","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1100"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Intermediary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediary"},{"name":"Malaria prophylaxis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_prophylaxis"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Debt relief","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"}]}
