{"id":87207,"title":"Comparison of different rabbit ATG preparation effects on early lymphocyte subset recovery after allogeneic HSCT and its association with EBV-mediated PTLD.","abstract":"Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is commonly used before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Studies comparing the effect of different ATG preparations and dosages on immune reconstitution and risk for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-mediated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) are rare.In this retrospective study, we determined T and B cell subsets by flow cytometry after allo-HSCT in children, who received ATG-Genzyme (ATG-G, n = 15), ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F, n = 25) or no-ATG treatment (n = 19). Additionally, PCR-quantified EBV-genome copy counts were correlated with incidence of PTLD.We could confirm a dose-dependent impairment of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell regeneration by ATG-G, including naÃ¯ve and memory CD4(+) T cells. No differences were seen between the currently applied dosages of 5-10 mg/kg ATG-G and 20-60 mg/kg ATG-F. Significantly delayed T cell subset reconstitution was determined only at high dosages of 20-60 mg/kg ATG-G compared to ATG-F. B cell reconstitution was comparably impaired in ATG-G- and ATG-F-treated patients. Although the incidence of EBV reactivation was similar in both ATG groups, EBV copy counts of >10(4) copies/10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the occurrence of PTLD were only found in ATG-G-treated patients.We conclude that high, but importantly not currently applied low dosages of ATG-G, impair thymic T cell regeneration and memory T cell immunity to a greater extent than ATG-F in pediatric patients. In addition, our results suggest an increased risk for EBV-PTLD when treated with ATG-G. Prospective studies are warranted to compare different ATG preparations with regard to the immune reconstitution and EBV-PTLD.","date":"2014-10-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962343","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.892578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.863726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.830126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.679962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.594222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.458458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.336651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.295312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
