{"id":90332,"title":"Retrosternal displacement of the clavicle after medial physeal fracture in an adolescent: MRI.","abstract":"Retrosternal displacement of the medial clavicular metaphysis after a medial physeal fracture is a rare and potentially fatal injury because of possible damage of neurovascular structures, trachea and oesophagus. As the medial clavicular epiphysis does not ossify until 18-20 years of age and the medial clavicular physis is the last to close, around 22-25 years of age, this injury is difficult to demonstrate with plain radiographs in younger patients and is often mistaken for a sternoclavicular joint dislocation. We report on a 16-year-old boy with a fracture of the medial clavicular physis with retrosternal displacement of the metaphysis that was diagnosed with MRI, and discuss the diagnostic tools and treatment options in this rare injury.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626100","annotations":[{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.85059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Metaphysis","weight":0.819783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysis"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.760992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.447675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.410982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sternoclavicular articulation","weight":0.35623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternoclavicular_articulation"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physis"},{"name":"Plain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"},{"name":"1820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1820"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
