{"id":88726,"title":"Does minor trauma in pregnancy affect perinatal outcome?","abstract":"To investigate pregnancy outcome after minor trauma and to identify risk factors at admission that may predict adverse pregnancy outcome.A retrospective study held between January-2005 and December-2011. Pregnant women at 23 weeks or more, who were admitted due to minor trauma, were included. A standard protocol was applied: physical examination, lab tests and a fetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) and tocometer for 1 h. In cases of symptomatic women, abnormal FHRM or presence of uterine contractions, the length of monitoring was extended. All women were admitted for 24 h of observation. The primary outcome was a composite adverse outcome that included at least one of the following: placental abruption, preterm birth and birthweight <2,500 g. To investigate pregnancy outcome and identify risk factors that may predict pregnancy outcome, matched (1:2) non-trauma controls were included. Risk factors examined included maternal obstetric variables, complaints at admission, clinical findings, lab test results, FHRM and tocometer findings.A total of 512 women with minor trauma and 1,024 non-trauma controls were included. Composite outcome occurred in 48 (9.4 %) and 131 (12.9 %) of the study and the control groups, respectively (p = 0.04; OR 0.71; 95 % CI, 0.5-0.99). None of the parameters examined at admission predicted the occurrence of the composite outcome.Pregnant women after minor trauma have a favorable pregnancy outcome. None of the parameters examined at admission were predictive of adverse outcome. Extensive evaluation at admission and observation for 24 h are probably unnecessary following minor trauma, particularly for asymptomatic women.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798932","annotations":[{"name":"Placental abruption","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental_abruption"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.629262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.345291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.257578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cardiotocography","weight":0.220076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotocography"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.135883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.134477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Uterine contraction","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_contraction"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Fetal circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_circulation"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
