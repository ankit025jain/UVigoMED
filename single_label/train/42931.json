{"id":42931,"title":"Cutaneous metastasis from primary gastric cancer: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Cutaneous metastases of internal neoplasms are uncommon. They can be metachronous or synchronous to the primary tumor and typically appear late in the course of advanced malignant disease. Gastric cancer rarely is reported as a cause of cutaneous metastasis; the most common metastatic sites are the liver, peritoneal cavity, and lymph nodes. We report a case of cutaneous metastasis from a primary gastric tumor that had been treated 6 years prior. There was no visceral invasion. The patient was treated successfully via a relaparotomy to exclude any macroscopic abdominal recurrence and complete excision of the lesion with a plastic flap to compensate for the tissue lost in the resection. Treatment plans vary depending on the diameter and number of lesions, the presence of visceral metastases, and the physical status of the patient. Therapy generally includes local excision, irradiation, or chemotherapy.
