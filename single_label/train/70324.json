{"id":70324,"title":"D-dimer levels in the differential diagnosis between lipoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma.","abstract":"Lipoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLS) are two representative lipogenic soft tissue tumors that have similar clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics. Accordingly, it is difficult to distinguish these tumors preoperatively. Plasma D-dimer levels are associated with the status of tumor progression, and we hypothesized that D-dimer levels could contribute to differential diagnosis. The D-dimer levels of these two entities have not yet been reported.We investigated 43 cases of lipoma and 14 cases of WDLS. We evaluated the utility of D-dimer levels and other clinicopathological factors for preoperative differential diagnosis between the two entities.Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the D-dimer level may contribute to differential diagnosis (area under the curve=0.73). Univariate and multivariate models demonstrated that plasma D-dimer levels (p=0.001 (univariate), and p=0.006 (multivariate)) and lower extremity location (p=0.006 (univariate), and p=0.03 (multivariate)) were independent risk factors for WDLS.The D-dimer level may be a helpful marker for preoperative differential diagnosis between lipoma and WDLS.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202112","annotations":[{"name":"Liposarcoma","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposarcoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.743385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.522302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.490911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.340592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lipoma","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoma"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_divisions_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
