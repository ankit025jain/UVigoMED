{"id":50172,"title":"Vascular skeletalization: a new concept to improve the resection rate in childhood neuroblastoma.","abstract":"The surgical resection rate in childhood neuroblastoma (Stage III and IV) is relatively low and influences the prognosis greatly. This study analyzes the primary resection rate neuroblastoma in children.The tumors are shrunk with pre-operative chemotherapy and surgical resection beginning from the iliac vessels is performed to skeletalize the large retroperitoneal vascular. Using this method, 22 cases of childhood neuroblastoma received resections and the outcomes were analyzed.The tumors were completely removed in 21 out of the 22 cases (95.45% in total). There were no serious complications and perioperative deaths.Using proper surgical methods and skeletalizing the large retroperitoneal vessels significantly increases the resection rate.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819488","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.647665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.573821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.546244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
