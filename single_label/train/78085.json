{"id":78085,"title":"How we do it: the absorbable gelatin sponge cube, an effective and economical approach to packing in ear surgery.","abstract":"There is currently a lack of robust evidence on the best form of packing for otological surgery. We describe the use of the absorbable gelatin sponge, a packing material that does not require removal and has the benefit of being considerably cheaper compared to other common forms of ear packing.A comparison was made of the financial cost of several forms of packing for common otological procedures. In addition, a retrospective audit of complications was undertaken of all patients in whom the absorbable gelatin sponge was used over the past three years.The absorbable gelatin sponge was shown to be cheaper to purchase per unit and also more economical to use. It has been the exclusive form of packing used in 519 procedures over the past three years at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford (UK), with very few complications noted at the follow-up review.We strongly advocate using the absorbable gelatin sponge, a packing material that is kinder to the patient, has similar efficacy to other forms of packing and is also much cheaper to use compared to other common forms of packing.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785117","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.517965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"William Harvey","weight":0.343158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"William Harvey Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey_Hospital"},{"name":"Ashford, Kent","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford,_Kent"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Cube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube"},{"name":"William the Conqueror","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror"},{"name":"Ossicles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Otology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"},{"name":"Clusivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusivity"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"In-ear monitor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ear_monitor"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
