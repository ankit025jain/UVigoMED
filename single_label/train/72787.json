{"id":72787,"title":"Intratumoral DNA content heterogeneity in breast carcinomas demonstrated by core punch tissue sampling and flow cytometry.","abstract":"Further to advancements in instrumentation and fluorescent dye technologies, there has been a resurgence of interest in the flow cytometric assay of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Here we present a novel, simple and effective alternative to whole block sectioning that allows selective multisampling of tissues within a specimen block and the investigation of intratumoral heterogeneity. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma specimens were core-punched using 1.0?mm diameter needles and assayed by flow cytometry using a modified Hedley method. Intratumoral heterogeneity for DNA index and per cent S-phase fraction was detected in 10 of 23 (44%) and 11 of 23 (47%) specimens respectively. Macro-level genomic heterogeneity is common in breast cancer even within a single surgical specimen block. Studies investigating the relationship of DNA content heterogeneity to other markers of genomic instability such as mutations, deletions, insertions and translocations are warranted.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24942799","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.46606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.314448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.242677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.222485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Multisample anti-aliasing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing"},{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Hedley (band)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedley_(band)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
