{"id":89391,"title":"[Spontaneous nasal liquorrhea and the Sternberg canal: scientific hypothesis and personal experience].","abstract":"Spontaneous nasal liquorrhea (SNL) is a pathological condition previously regarded as a casuistic one but increasingly frequently described in the current literature. The present review is focused on the causes of SNL, such as the anomalous anatomical structure of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. One of the variants of the anatomical structure is the so-called Sternberg canal. Its anatomical structure and formation in the course of embryonic development are described. The presence of the Sternberg canal in the adult subjects is considered to be the main cause underlying SNL and meningoencephalocele originating from the lateral parts of the sphenoidal sinus. The main variants of the endoscopic endonasal approach for the treatment of the fluid fistulas located in the lateral parts of the sphenoidal sinuses are described. A series of the original authors' observations is reported including 173 patients presenting with SN l who were operated in 1999-2011.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724202","annotations":[{"name":"Sphenoidal sinus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoidal_sinus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.839625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.646255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.440061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Sinus (anatomy)","weight":0.37397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.175885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Embryogenesis","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Lateral parts of occipital bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_parts_of_occipital_bone"},{"name":"Saturday Night Live","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
