{"id":63960,"title":"Murine Pten(-/-) T-ALL requires non-redundant PI3K/mTOR and DLL4/Notch1 signals for maintenance and ?c/TCR signals for thymic exit.","abstract":"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) commonly display constitutively active PI3K/mTOR and Notch signaling. However, controversy surrounds whether these pathways have independent functions and whether Pten loss is sufficient to generate resistance to Notch inhibition. Here we report that Pten(-/-) T-ALL is sensitive to either PI3K/mTOR or Notch inhibition alone, each pathway controlling distinct downstream signaling events that cannot be rescued by activation of the other pathway, consistent with independent, non-redundant functions. Although many human T-ALLs display constitutively activating Notch1 mutations, primary Pten(-/-) T-ALLs expressed wild-type Notch1 and depended on the Notch ligand DLL4 in vivo. Pten(-/-) T-ALLs with or without ?c/TCR signaling responded similarly to PI3K/mTOR and Notch inhibition, although extended culture in vitro occasionally induced Notch-independent growth. However, unlike the T-ALLs lacking only Pten, eight of 23 Pten(-/-) T-ALLs that also lacked ?c/TCR signaling accumulated Notch1 mutations, suggesting crosstalk between ?c/TCR and Notch signaling. Importantly, we concluded that loss of ?c/TCR signaling also inhibited thymic exit of Pten(-/-) T-ALLs. Our results may be clinically relevant in revealing that Pten loss is not sufficient to engender resistance to Notch inhibition, uncovering a role in T-ALL for ligand-dependent induction of wild-type Notch1, and suggesting that ?c/TCR signaling could be targeted for preventing metastasis.
