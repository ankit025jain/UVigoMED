{"id":62795,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic biopsies for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma: a clinicopathologic study of 48 patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to reveal the diagnostic accuracy of initial pathologic assessment of biopsied samples in patients with gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma lesions. A total of 48 patients with follicular lymphoma (Lugano system stage I: n = 30; II1: n = 4; II2: n = 4; IV: n = 10) with gastrointestinal involvement who underwent endoscopic biopsy were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed. Nine (18.8%) of the 48 patients were not appropriately diagnosed as having follicular lymphoma at the initial biopsy. The initial pathological diagnosis included extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (n = 4), necrotic tissue (n = 2), duodenitis (n = 1), or suspected lymphoma of unspecified subtype (n = 2). The reasons for these inappropriate diagnoses were insufficient histopathologic analysis lacking CD10 and BCL2 staining (n = 7) and unsuitable biopsy samples taken from erosions or ulcers that contained scanty lymphoma cells or no lymphoid follicles (n = 2). In conclusion, incomplete histopathologic analysis and unsuitable biopsy samples are pitfalls in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma.
