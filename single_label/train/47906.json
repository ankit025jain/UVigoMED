{"id":47906,"title":"PDCD4 as a predictor of sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the role of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) expression in predicting tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and outcomes for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Clinicopathological factors and expression of PDCD4 were evaluated in 92 patients with LARC treated with nCRT. After the completion of therapy, 4 cases achieved clinical complete response (cCR), and thus the remaining 88 patients underwent a standardized total mesorectal excision procedure. There were 38 patients (41.3%) with a good response (TRG 3-4) and 54 (58.7%) with a poor one (TRG 0-2).Immunohistochemical staining analyses showed that patients with high expression of PDCD4 were more sensitive to nCRT than those with low PDCD4 expression (P=0.02). High PDCD4 expression before nCRT and good response (TRG3-4) were significantly associated with improved 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the pretreatment PDCD4 expression was an independent prognostic factor.Our study demonstrated that high expression of PDCD4 protein is a useful predictive factor for good tumor response to nCRT and good outcomes in patients with LARC.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568503","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.69057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.6891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.59375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.549851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Total mesorectal excision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_mesorectal_excision"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"}]}
