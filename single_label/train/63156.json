{"id":63156,"title":"Replacement of mycophenolate acid with everolimus in patients who became neutropenic after renal transplant.","abstract":"Neutropenia after kidney transplant is an adverse event usually treated with a dosage reduction of mycophenolic acid. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of substituting mycophenolic acid with everolimus in patients with persistent neutropenia after kidney transplant.This study was a retrospective analysis. A total of 17 patients who were initially treated with mycophenolic acid (1912 ± 196 mg/d), calcineurin inhibitors, and methylprednisolone for kidney transplant were included.In 15 patients, neutropenia occurred within the first 3 months (during valganciclovir administration), and in 2 patients between the fourth and sixth month after transplant. One hundred eighteen episodes of neutropenia were recorded, originally treated by reducing the dosage of mycophenolic acid (765 ± 390 mg/d) and administering granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Three patients experienced acute rejection 5 to 10 days after reducing the dosage of mycophenolic acid, and they were successfully treated with pulse steroids. Five patients developed cytomegalovirus infection 108 ± 65 days after the onset of neutropenia. After replacing mycophenolic acid with everolimus, episodes of neutropenia were observed in 6 patients. In 1 patient, discontinuing everolimus was necessary after 1.5 months of treatment. In 5 patients with cytomegalovirus infection, neutropenia subsided after termination of valganciclovir treatment. In the remaining 11 patients, no episodes of neutropenia were observed. No episodes of acute rejection occurred, and renal function remained stable during a followup of 47 ± 30 months (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFRMDRD6]: 45 ± 14 mL/min/1.73 m2?47 ± 22 mL/min/1.73 m2].Replacing mycophenolic acid with everolimus appears to be a safe and effective alternative treatment in neutropenic renal transplant recipients.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471721","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Everolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everolimus"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Valganciclovir","weight":0.882464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valganciclovir"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.684469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.477973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.402232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.376707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.193714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"}]}
