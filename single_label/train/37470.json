{"id":37470,"title":"An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology Guidelines for the Management of Gout.","abstract":"Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B*5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary
