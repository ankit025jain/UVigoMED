{"id":24217,"title":"A preliminary study of transcaecal ileostomy as an alternative to defunctioning ostomies.","abstract":"To evaluate the usefulness of a transcaecal ileostomy catheter for protecting distal lower rectal anastomosis as an alternative to conventional ileostomy.Patients with a rectal cancer located 3-10 cm from the anal verge were included in the study. In all cases, an open low or ultra-low anterior resection of the rectum was performed with total mesorectal excision. A balloon catheter was inserted through the caecum and ileocaecal valve, with the catheter's distal end placed in terminal ileum. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed 7 days postoperatively to check the integrity of the anastomosis; the transcaecal catheter was withdrawn if no complications were detected.Eighteen patients were treated with a transcaecal catheter. Two patients developed cellulitis (11.1%) in the catheter exit wound. In both cases, successful healing was achieved within a month of surgery. One patient had anastomotic dehiscence (5.5%) after removal of the catheter following a normal CT examination. The median hospital stay was 10 days (range 8-13 days).A transcaecal ileostomy catheter to protect a distal rectal anastomosis is a potential alternative to loop ileostomy with potentially fewer complications and without need for a second procedure for closure.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447708","annotations":[{"name":"Ileostomy","weight":0.90346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileostomy"},{"name":"Total mesorectal excision","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_mesorectal_excision"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Ileocecal valve","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileocecal_valve"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stoma (medicine)","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.703764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Terminal ileum","weight":0.433174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_ileum"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.310135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.249922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.165452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Penetrating trauma","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrating_trauma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Balloon catheter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_catheter"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
