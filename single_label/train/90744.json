{"id":90744,"title":"Drowning in children: Utstein style reporting and outcome.","abstract":"We report the incidence and mortality of paediatric drowning incidents according to 'Utstein Style for Drowning' guidelines.Retrospective study including all the drowned children under 16 years of age who were hospitalised or died with or without attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between 1997 and 2007 in the province of Uusimaa, Finland. Survival rates provided at hospital discharge and after 1-year follow-up period are reported.A total of 58 drowned children were either admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit or died during the study period. The median (interquartile range) age was 5.9 (3.1, 7.8) years. The annual incidence of drowning was 1.9/100,000 and was highest, 2.8/100,000, in children aged between 1 and 4 years. The annual mortality rate was 0.9/100,000. Of all the 58 patients, 14 (24%) died at the scene, 22 (38.1%) before the hospital discharge, and 26 (45%) within the 1 year. The number of non-fatal drownings was 1.2-fold that of fatal drownings. The survival rate of the 26 patients for whom CPR was initiated by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel was 42% at hospital discharge, with the 1-year survival rate being 27%.The incidence of drowning in children and the survival rate of those children in whom CPR was initiated by EMS personnel was in line with the previously reported. However, the overall mortality rate in drowned children was higher than estimated in previous studies.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24580104","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Drowning","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Uusimaa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uusimaa"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Emergency medical services in Germany","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services_in_Germany"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Utstein Abbey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utstein_Abbey"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 8100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8100"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
