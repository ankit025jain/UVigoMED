{"id":82056,"title":"Relationships between third-molar juxta-apical radiolucencies and mandibular canals in panoramic and cone beam computed tomography images.","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the relationship between third-molar juxta-apical radiolucencies and mandibular canals on panoramic and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.Forty-two patients were included in this retrospective study. The root apices and the relationships of the juxta-apical radiolucencies to the mandibular canals were evaluated on both panoramic and CBCT images. The McNemar test (P < .05) was used to compare panoramic with CBCT findings.Root apices were visualized clearly with CBCT in most cases for which the apices were not seen clearly on panoramic images. Similarly, juxta-apical radiolucencies were separate from the mandibular canals with CBCT in most cases.The present study found that there is no consistent intimate relationship between juxta-apical radiolucencies and the mandibular canals. Similar studies with larger sample sizes are required to further confirm these findings.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725991","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"McNemar's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar's_test"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0187755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Panorama","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama"},{"name":"Panoramic photography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panoramic_photography"},{"name":"Beam (structure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(structure)"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Intimate relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"}]}
