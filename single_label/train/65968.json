{"id":65968,"title":"Effect of Cinnamomum cassia methanol extract and sildenafil on arginase and sexual function of young male Wistar rats.","abstract":"Herbs have been used as an aphrodisiac since ages. Cinnamomum cassia is an important ingredient of many Ayurvedic formulations to treat male sexual disorder including erectile dysfunction (ED).The objective of the present study was to evaluate erectogenic and aphrodisiac activity of methanol extract of C. cassia bark in young male rats.Methanol extract of C. cassia was screened in vitro for arginase inhibition potential and IC50 was determined. Effect of the extract was observed in vitro on phenylephrine pre-contracted isolated rat corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) at 0.1, 1, 10, and 100??g/mL. Young male Wistar rats were dosed with extract at 100 mg/kg body weight for 28 days and its effects on sexual behavior and penile smooth muscle : collagen level were observed.Effect of C. cassia was studied on arginase activity in vitro and sexual behavior of young male rats.C. cassia inhibited arginase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 61.72?Â±?2.20??g/mL. The extract relaxed phenylephrine pre-contracted isolated rat CCSM up to 43% and significantly increased (P?<?0.05) sexual function of young male rats. Treatment with the extract also increased smooth muscle level and decreased collagen level in rat penile tissue.The study proves usefulness of methanol extract of C. cassia bark for increasing sexual function.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758372","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Sildenafil","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil"},{"name":"Aphrodisiac","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodisiac"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.72816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Ayurveda","weight":0.651267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.554997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Corpus cavernosum penis","weight":0.547273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.524967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Phenylephrine","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.37222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.348448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.278431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oral contraceptive formulations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_contraceptive_formulations"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
