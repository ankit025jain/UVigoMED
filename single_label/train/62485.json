{"id":62485,"title":"Reduction of linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia by the dose adjustment based on the risk factors such as basal platelet count and body weight.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of dose modification based on the risk factor for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. A multivariate logistic regression analysis performed in the observational study showed that low body weight of <55 kg (odds ratio [OR]: 33.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.16-510.1, P = 0.012) and the baseline platelet count of <200 Ã— 10(3)/mm(3) (OR: 24.9, 95% CI: 1.53-404.7, P = 0.024) were found to be risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. In the subsequent intervention study, in which daily dose of linezolid was set to 20 mg/kg in patients with either one of the risk factors or 1200 mg in those without any risk factor, the onset of thrombocytopenia was significantly prolonged in the intervention study group (P = 0.043), without reducing clinical efficacy. These findings suggest that dose adjustment of linezolid is effective in preventing thrombocytopenia without reducing its clinical efficacy in patients having risk factors.
