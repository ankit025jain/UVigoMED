{"id":72258,"title":"Multidisciplinary cancer care: does it improve outcomes?","abstract":"Multidisciplinary care has been advocated as a solution for increasingly complex treatment decisions in cancer patients. The impact of multidisciplinary care on patient survival has been studied, but evidence is limited by poor methodological quality. Lack of conclusive evidence for increased survival is balanced against improvements in quality of care, guideline adherence, reduction in wait times, and greater satisfaction for patients and care providers.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986235","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.480865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.376231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0719954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Heterozygote advantage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Separation of powers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"}]}
