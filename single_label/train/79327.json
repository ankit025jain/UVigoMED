{"id":79327,"title":"An Australian version of the acceptable noise level test and its predictive value for successful hearing aid use in an older population.","abstract":"The acceptable noise level (ANL), a measure of noise tolerance, has been proposed as a predictor for successful hearing aid use. The aims of this study were to obtain normative data, and to evaluate the clinical feasibility and predictive value of an Australian version of the ANL test in an older population.Repeated ANL measurements were presented diotically using earphones. All participants provided demographic information and hearing aid owners were asked about their aid use.A total of 290 older adults were assessed; 166 participants had a hearing impairment and 96 owned a hearing aid.The mean ANL was lower than previously reported. While age and gender had no effect on ANL, a significant, but weak, correlation was found between ANL and hearing loss. The test-retest reliability showed the results were clinically unreliable. In addition, the ANL did not predict hours or pattern of hearing aid use.While the Australian ANL test showed several similar characteristics to previous versions of the test, low test-retest reliability raised questions about its clinical value as a predictor for long-term hearing aid use.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447234","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.584424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.417884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.412202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.388552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.16403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Noise (electronics)","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0628516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Headphones","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Australian National Line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Line"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Engineering tolerance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance"}]}
