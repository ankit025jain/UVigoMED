{"id":20066,"title":"[Clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of invasive group A ?-hemolytic streptococcus infection in children].","abstract":"Group A ?-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes may be encountered in diverse clinical situations in children. A rising incidence of invasive group A streptococcus (IGAS) infections has been noted in children in the past three decades. The aim of this study was to summarize the clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of IGAS in children, and to raise the level of diagnosis and treatment of this infection.The clinical data from 19 cases of IGAS younger than 14 years old seen from January 2004 to December 2011 treated in the authors' hospital were analyzed. IGAS infections are defined as the isolation of GAS from a normally sterile site in patients.The 19 cases were identified as IGAS infections, among whom 15 were male and 4 were female, and the ratio of them was 3.75. The age ranged from 1 day to 14 years, with a median age of 4 years. The course of disease was 4 h-10 days. The average length of stay was 12.2 days. In 13 cases the episodes of the infection occurred in winter and spring. In 18 cases the infection was community-acquired. Overall, 10 cases had neck or foot dorsum abscess, four cases had purulent peritonitis, and 3 cases were diagnosed as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) complicated with empyema, pyopneumothorax occurred in 1 case and neonatal septicemia in another. Three cases had an underlying disease, including 2 cases wounded in a car accident and 1 case of congenital esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. Before the isolation of GAS, 5 cases had stayed in ICUs, the length of ICU stay was 1-32 days, 4 cases had received intubation and mechanical ventilation, the ventilation time was 8 h-24 days, 2 cases had received major surgery; 5 cases had other pathogen coinfection, including 4 cases of abdominal pus at the same time and Escherichia coli was isolated, and 1 case had parainfluenza virus type I coinfection. Peripheral blood leucocyte increased in 18 cases, one case dropped off. The C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased in all patients, including 16 cases who had 14-160 mg/L, 3 cases had levels higher than 160 mg/L. Twenty strains of GAS were isolated from 19 cases' sterile sites, of them 10 strains were isolated from abscess, 4 strains were isolated from blood and another 4 from ascites. Two strains were from the same patient at different times of pleural effusion. All 20 strains displayed a full susceptibility to cefazolin, levofloxacin and vancomycin, and the rates of resistance to both cefotaxime and penicillin were 10.0%. The rates of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin were 55.0% and 70.0% respectively. Among the patients 3 cases were cured, 14 cases improved, and 2 cases died, of whom 1 case died of STSS secondary to multiple organ dysfunction, 1 case died of basic disease secondary to multiple organ dysfunction.Skin and soft tissues were the most common IGAS infection sites in children, and IGAS infection also can lead to serious STSS and even can be life threatening. Penicillin and cephalosporin are still sensitive for children IGAS infections.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
