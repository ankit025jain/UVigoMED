{"id":51771,"title":"Bipolar disorder in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO).","abstract":"This study was designed to determine the prevalence of bipolar disorder in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO). One hundred and ten women with definite diagnosis of PCO and one hundred and ten age-matched infertile women due to other reasons except for PCO were enrolled in this case-control study. Ten ml fasting venous blood sample obtained to measure fasting glucose, LH and FSH. Height, weight and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were also recorded by an expert technician. A psychiatrist examined all 220 cases in order to determine the prevalence of depression and bipolarity. Mean age of each group participants were not significantly different while FBS, LH and LH/FSH levels were significantly higher in PCO patients. Eighty eight case were depressed in PCO group while 96 were depressed in control group (P=0.03). Bipolar disorder were higher in PCO group in comparison with controls (8 vs. 0, P=0.004). Psychiatric disorders should be considered in PCO women.
