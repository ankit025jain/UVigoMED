{"id":90029,"title":"Non-weight-bearing status compromises the functional level up to 1 yr after hip fracture surgery.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of weight-bearing (WB) status after hip fracture surgery on 1-yr functional outcome.This was a prospective cohort study, carried out in a public acute hospital trauma service. The 194 patients (36 men and 158 women), with a mean (SD) age of 81.4 (6.1) yrs, were admitted with a hip fracture within 2009 and were followed for 1 yr thereafter. The influence of postoperative WB status on the 1-yr functional outcome was assessed using the Functional Independence Measure (18-126 points), adjusting for other known factors by multiple linear regression.Seventy-five patients (39%) were not allowed WB for a period of 2-4 wks after surgery. Improved functional outcomes were associated positively with prefracture functional level and having a trochanteric fracture during the first year after fracture (P ? 0.01). Non-WB status, age, health status, and cognitive impairment of the patient were associated negatively with the 1-yr functional outcome (P ? 0.03). Prefracture functional level and non-WB status were the strongest determinants of functional level (? = 0.599 and -0.204, respectively; P < 0.001).WB status after surgery, in addition to prefracture function, cognitive status, health status, age and fracture type, was found to be an independent predictor of the 1-yr functional outcome in hip fracture patients.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658428","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.518726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.359972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.331577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Level up","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_up"},{"name":"The WB Television Network","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"}]}
