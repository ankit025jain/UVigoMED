{"id":47357,"title":"Acute liver failure secondary to metastatic liver infiltration: case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"We present the case of a patient who died from multiple organ failure due to acute liver failure as a result of malignant hepatic infiltration by an adenocarcinoma. A review of the literature revealed that the clinical picture, laboratory examination, and imaging studies do not contribute to the diagnosis of this rare cause of liver failure. Therefore, liver biopsy should be considered early in the process, as this diagnosis is a contraindication for orthotopic liver transplantation.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592549","annotations":[{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.774857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.765978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.650183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.258022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.172526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
