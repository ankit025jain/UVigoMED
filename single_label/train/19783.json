{"id":19783,"title":"Nosocomial Candida parapsilosis candidaemia: risk factors, antifungal susceptibility and outcome.","abstract":"A retrospective analysis was undertaken from 2000 to 2010 to show the risk factors associated with death within 30 days in patients with C. parapsilosis candidaemia (CPC). Fifty-one cases of nosocomial CPC were included in the analysis. All isolates from blood cultures were susceptible to micafungin and fluconazole. The overall mortality rate was 23.5%, and the most severe complications were endocarditis (5.9%) and endophthalmitis (5.9%). On multi-variate analysis, APACHE II score >25 (odds ratio 43.9) and retained cardiovascular prosthetic materials (RCPM) (prosthetic valve or graft) (odds ratio 14.6) were found to be risk factors associated with death. Prompt surgical removal should be considered in CPC patients with RCPM.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698737","annotations":[{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Artificial heart valve","weight":0.301124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart_valve"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"APACHE II","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APACHE_II"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"Micafungin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micafungin"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Communist Party of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
