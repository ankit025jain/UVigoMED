{"id":35700,"title":"Endoscopic resection of intranasal meningo-encephalocele accompanying meningioma.","abstract":"This paper aims to present the case of a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with a rare condition of meningoencephalocele that arose from a meningioma, and treated with endoscope-assisted transnasal tumor extirpation and repair of the skull base defect with tensor fascia lata flap. Endoscope-assisted operation is a viable and minimally invasive alternative to traditional craniotomy. With improved endoscopic equipment and operative technique, we can perform more reliable surgery and provide better quality of life for these patients.
