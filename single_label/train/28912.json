{"id":28912,"title":"Mid-ventricular variant takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome: a case report.","abstract":"A case of the mid-ventricular variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is reported, occurring in a patient with Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS), and presented with a review of the relevant literature. The patient is a 32-year-old woman who presented with epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. Her EKG showed dynamic T-wave changes associated with a modest cardiac biomarker elevation. Ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggestive of the mid-ventricular variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy were demonstrated by echocardiography, ventriculography and cardiac angiography, the latter showing normal coronary arteries. The patient was a previous marijuana user who had recently ingested marijuana after a period of abstinence. Severe epigastric pain, nausea and cyclic vomiting followed this. She had previously experienced similar gastrointestinal symptoms, relieved by compulsive hot water bathing, and resolving after marijuana cessation. Recent resumption of marijuana use was followed by a recurrence of these symptoms, a pattern characteristic of CHS. The association of cardiomyopathy with CHS has been described only once in the literature, and if this is a true relationship, its mechanism is not clearly defined. Animal models have suggested that endocannabinoid receptors are expressed in the myocardium, which could be a pathway for developing cardiac manifestations with cannabinoid use.
