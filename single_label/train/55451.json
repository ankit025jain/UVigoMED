{"id":55451,"title":"Suppression of intraocular vascular endothelial growth factor during aflibercept treatment of age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To determine the duration of suppression of aqueous humor concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with aflibercept.Nonrandomized prospective clinical study.Twenty-seven eyes of 27 neovascular AMD patients receiving intravitreal aflibercept injections on a pro re nata regimen driven by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) were included in this study. A total of 132 aqueous humor specimens were collected before intravitreal aflibercept injections and their VEGF-A concentrations assayed by multiplex bead analysis.Mean aqueous humor VEGF concentrations before treatment initiation were 90.6 ± 37.1 pg/mL (range 23.4-190.3 pg/mL). Intravitreal injection of aflibercept suppressed the aqueous VEGF concentrations to below the lower limit of quantification (<4 pg/mL) in all patients. The mean duration of VEGF suppression below the lower limit of quantification was >71 ± 18 days. The earliest time after injection at which the VEGF concentration recovered to above the lower limit of quantification was 55 days in 1 patient and >56 days, the recommended aflibercept treatment interval, in 20 patients. The aqueous VEGF recovery status of 6 patients was uncertain after 56 days.On average, VEGF concentrations in the aqueous humor were suppressed below the lower limit of quantification after intravitreal aflibercept injections for about 10 weeks. This aqueous suppression time suggests durable VEGF inhibition for most patients dosed with aflibercept every 8 weeks.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879948","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.810034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.754085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.708277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.674871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.4162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0420558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Channel 37","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_37"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"}]}
