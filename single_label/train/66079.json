{"id":66079,"title":"Does prolonged pituitary down-regulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist improve the live-birth rate in in vitro fertilization treatment?","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of a prolonged duration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) in pituitary down-regulation for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) on the live-birth rate in nonendometriotic women undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET).Retrospective cohort study.University-affiliated hospital.Normogonadotropic women undergoing IVF.Three hundred seventy-eight patients receiving a prolonged pituitary down-regulation with GnRH-a before ovarian stimulation and 422 patients receiving a GnRH-a long protocol.Live-birth rate per fresh ET.In comparison with the long protocol, the prolonged down-regulation protocol required a higher total dose of gonadotropins. A lower serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level on the starting day of gonadotropin and the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and a fewer number of oocytes and embryos were observed in the prolonged down-regulation protocol. However, the duration of stimulation and number of high-quality embryos were comparable between the two groups. A statistically significantly higher implantation rate (50.27% vs. 39.69%), clinical pregnancy rate (64.02% vs. 56.87%) and live-birth rate per fresh transfer cycle (55.56% vs. 45.73%) were observed in the prolonged protocol.Prolonged down-regulation in a GnRH-a protocol might increase the live-birth rates in normogonadotropic women.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746740","annotations":[{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Embryo transfer","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.78188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.562308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.53484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.172547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Sexual stimulation","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_stimulation"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
