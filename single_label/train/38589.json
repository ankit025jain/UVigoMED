{"id":38589,"title":"Audiological evaluation in spinocerebellar ataxia.","abstract":"To describe the audiological and electrophysiological results in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA).Retrospective and cross-sectional studies were performed. Forty-three patients were assessed using the following procedures: anamnesis and otolaryngologic exam, pure tone audiometry, acoustic immittance measures and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP).Patients showed gait abnormality (83.7%), speech disorder (48.8%), dizziness (41.8%) and dysphagia (39.5%). Hearing loss was referred in 27.9% of the cases; in the audiometric exams, 14 patients (32.5%) presented disorders; in SCA 3, 33.3%; in SCA 2, 12.5%; in SCA 4, 100.0%; in SCA 6, 100.0%; in SCA 7, 100.0%; in SCA 10, 50.0%; and in undetermined SCA, 21.4%. In BAEP, 20 patients (46.5%) were abnormal, being 58.3% in SCA 3, 62.5% in SCA 2, 100.0% in SCA 6, 100.0% in SCA 7, 66.7% in SCA 10 and 14.2% in undetermined SCA. While in acoustic immittance, 19 patients (44.1%) presented disorders, being 50.0% in SCA 3, 50.0% in SCA 2, 100.0% in SCA 4, 100.0% in SCA 6, 100.0% in SCA 7, 33.3% in SCA 10 and 28.5% in undetermined SCA.The most evident abnormalities in the audiological evaluation were the predominance of the down-sloping audiometric configuration beginning at 4 kHz bilaterally and the bilateral absence of acoustic reflex at the frequencies of 3 and 4 kHz. In the electrophysiological evaluation, 50% of the patients showed abnormalities with prevalence of an increase of the latency of waves I, II and V and of the interval in the interpeaks I-III, I-V and III-V.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413425","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.96231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.884752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Speech disorder","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disorder"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.366311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.316544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.213347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.133181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0797502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Acoustic reflex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex"},{"name":"Gait abnormality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_abnormality"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar ataxia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar tract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_tract"},{"name":"44,100 Hz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
