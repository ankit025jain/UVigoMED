{"id":66895,"title":"[Interpretation of volemia in acute kidney injury].","abstract":"Assessment of volume status is often challenging in daily clinical practice. One of the clinician's tasks is to prevent or to treat organ systems failures that arise from a mismatch between the transport of oxygen and metabolic needs. Renal failure is a frequently encountered in-hospital diagnosis that is known to alter significantly the prognosis. In patients with acute renal failure in particular, the consequences of an inadequate volume management further increase morbidity and mortality.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665656","annotations":[{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.751024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.697668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.517802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Intravascular volume status","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravascular_volume_status"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"}]}
