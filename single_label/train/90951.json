{"id":90951,"title":"Differences in mortality, risk factors, and complications after open and endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.","abstract":"Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) has faced resistance owing to the marginal evidence of benefit over open surgical repair (OSR). This study aims to determine the impact of treatment modality on early mortality after rAAA, and to assess differences in postoperative complications and long-term survival.Patients treated between January 2000 and June 2013 were identified. The primary endpoint was early mortality. Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications and long-term survival. Independent risk factors for early mortality were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Survival estimates were obtained by means of Kaplan-Meier curves.Two hundred and twenty-one patients were treated (age 72 ± 8 years, 90% male), 83 (38%) by EVAR and 138 (62%) by OSR. There were no differences between groups at the time of admission. Early mortality was significantly lower for EVAR compared with OSR (odds ratio [OR]: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.97). Similarly, EVAR was associated with a threefold risk reduction in major complications (OR: 0.33, 95%CI: 0.15-0.71). Hemoglobin level <11 mg/dL was predictive of early death for patients in both groups. Age greater than 75 years and the presence of shock were significant risk factors for early death after OSR, but not after EVAR. The early survival benefit of EVAR over OSR persisted for up to 3 years.This study shows an early mortality benefit after EVAR, which persists over the mid-term. It also suggests different prognostic significance for preoperative variables according to the type of repair. Age and the presence of shock were risk factors for early death after OSR, while hemoglobin level on admission was a risk factor for both groups. This information may contribute to repair-specific risk prediction and improved patient selection.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and
