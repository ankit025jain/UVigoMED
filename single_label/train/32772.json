{"id":32772,"title":"Pelvic arteriovenous malformation treated by transarterial glue embolisation combining proximal balloon occlusion and devascularisation of multiple feeding arteries.","abstract":"We present a case of a 70-year-old man with abdominal aortic aneurysm and coincident pelvic arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Before the operation for the aneurysm, we embolised the pelvic AVM that had multiple feeding arteries and an aneurysmal-dilated draining vein. After decreasing the number of the feeding arteries by coil embolisation, an n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate/lipiodol mixture (1:1) was injected into the prominent feeding artery and nidus with proximal balloon occlusion of the right internal iliac artery to decrease the flow to the nidus. The mixture (1:4-8) was also added for the finer feeding arteries that became apparent after the initial procedure to embolise the rest of the nidus. A follow-up study showed no contrast enhancement of the nidus and aneurysmal draining vein.
