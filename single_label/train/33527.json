{"id":33527,"title":"An atlas of genetic influences on human blood metabolites.","abstract":"Genome-wide association scans with high-throughput metabolic profiling provide unprecedented insights into how genetic variation influences metabolism and complex disease. Here we report the most comprehensive exploration of genetic loci influencing human metabolism thus far, comprising 7,824 adult individuals from 2 European population studies. We report genome-wide significant associations at 145 metabolic loci and their biochemical connectivity with more than 400 metabolites in human blood. We extensively characterize the resulting in vivo blueprint of metabolism in human blood by integrating it with information on gene expression, heritability and overlap with known loci for complex disorders, inborn errors of metabolism and pharmacological targets. We further developed a database and web-based resources for data mining and results visualization. Our findings provide new insights into the role of inherited variation in blood metabolic diversity and identify potential new opportunities for drug development and for understanding disease.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816252","annotations":[{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.893756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.80625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.444669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.362601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data mining","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.281252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Blueprint","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Atlas","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
