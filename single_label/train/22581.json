{"id":22581,"title":"Statistical analysis of surgical site infection after head and neck reconstructive surgery.","abstract":"Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur at a rate exceeding 40 % after head and neck reconstruction and are due in part to the clean-contaminated surgical field, in which cutaneous fields interact with oral or pharyngeal fields. The aim of this study was to clarify the most important risk factors for SSI and to identify effective strategies for preventing SSI.In 2011 and 2012, 197 patients who underwent head and neck reconstructive surgery were studied at National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan. The SSI rate, risk factors for SSI, and biological aspects of SSI were evaluated prospectively.A total of 42 patients (21.3 %) had SSIs, and 62 bacterial species were identified at infection sites. Significant risk factors for SSI identified with multivariate analysis were hypoalbuminemia [P = 0.002, odds ratio (OR) = 3.37], reconstruction with vascularized bone transfer (P = 0.006, OR = 3.99), and a poor American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status score (P = 0.041, OR = 3.00). Most bacteria identified were species that persist around cutaneous and pharyngeal fields, but multidrug-resistant bacteria were rare.The SSI rate at our hospital is lower than rates in previous studies. To minimize SSI, intervention to improve the patient's perisurgical nutritional status and a more appropriate mandible reconstructive strategy should be considered.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531701","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.659206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.555127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.499871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.493017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.365147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.310454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.272442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.136621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Hypoalbuminemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalbuminemia"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
