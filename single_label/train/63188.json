{"id":63188,"title":"Familial myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia syndromes: a review and utility for translational investigations.","abstract":"The familial myelodysplastic (MDS)/acute leukemia (AL) predisposition syndromes are inherited disorders that lead to significantly increased lifetime risks of MDS and AL development. At present, four recognized syndromes have Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments--certified testing for their respective germ-line mutations: telomere biology disorders due to mutation of TERC or TERT, familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated CEBPA, familial MDS/AML with mutated GATA2, and familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy. These disorders are heterogeneous with regard to their causative genetic mutations, clinical presentation, and progression to MDS/AL. However, as a group, they all share the unique requirement for a high index of clinical suspicion to allow appropriate genetic counseling, genetic testing, and mutation-specific clinical management. In addition, translational investigations of individuals and families with these syndromes provide a rare opportunity to understand key pathways underlying susceptibility and progression to MDS/AL and allow the possibility of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of both familial and sporadic forms of MDS/AL.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467820","annotations":[{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.519776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.338759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.298346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.145066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0574572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Telomerase reverse transcriptase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"GATA transcription factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA_transcription_factor"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
