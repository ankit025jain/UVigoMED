{"id":43994,"title":"Inflammation is not the cause of an elevated serum ferritin in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","abstract":"In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD), it has often been assumed that an elevation in serum ferritin is likely related to inflammation rather than iron overload.Patients referred with NAFLD were entered into a clinical study of phlebotomy therapy. A liver biopsy with liver iron concentration was done at entry and 6 months after phlebotomy (n = 56) until the patient had a low serum ferritin or developed anemia. Serum ferritin was compared to liver iron concentration, ESR, CRP, BMI and grade of inflammation on liver biopsy.Iron removed by phlebotomy in NAFLD correlated with the decrease in serum ferritin (r = 0.57, p = 0.0014) and liver iron concentration (r = 0.57, p = 0.0013). There was no significant correlations between serum ferritin and ESR, CRP or grade of liver inflammation.Serum ferritin is related to liver iron storage in NAFLD and decreasing body iron stores by phlebotomy is reflected by an appropriate decrease in serum ferritin. Inflammation is not the cause of the elevated serum ferritin in fatty liver disease.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756010","annotations":[{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.90072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Phlebotomy","weight":0.887686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotomy"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.830534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Iron overload","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.741125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.437035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.385564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"}]}
