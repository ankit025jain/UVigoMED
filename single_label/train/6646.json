{"id":6646,"title":"Isolation of a goose parvovirus from swan and its molecular characteristics.","abstract":"Goose parvovirus (GPV) causes high mortality and morbidity in goslings and Muscovy ducklings. In this study, a GPV was isolated from a 20-day old swan in Shanghai, China. Complete genome of the swan isolate contained 5,050 nt and showed the highest homology with Taiwanese GPV isolates from 1982. In comparison with the Chinese mainland GPV isolates reported previously, the swan isolate shows two deletions, particularly at positions 67-80 and 334-347 in inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). These findings suggest that the swan could serve as a potential host for GPV and provide insights into molecular characteristics and etiology of GPV.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957727","annotations":[{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.829884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"China","weight":0.749935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.641817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Swan","weight":0.547422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.435845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.363154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Taiwanese people","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_people"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Goose","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose"},{"name":"Parvovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus"},{"name":"Grand Duchy of Moscow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow"},{"name":"Reformed Political League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Political_League"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"1982","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982"},{"name":"Presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenter"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Airport terminal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_terminal"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"}]}
