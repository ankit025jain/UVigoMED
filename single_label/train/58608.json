{"id":58608,"title":"[A weak association of 677 C>T polymorphism in MTHFR with recurrent embryonic loss].","abstract":"Early (embryonic) pregnancy loss before 10 week of gestation (wg) could also be related with endometrial receptivity as well as with gene expression regulation in developed embryo. Methylation of genome is a key process in the gene expression. Because the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) have had significant role in methionine metabolism polymorphisms into the gene could be related with early embryonic development. This study evaluated relationship between T allele in 677 C>T polymorphism in MTHFR and recurrent embryonic loss development. One hundred six women with tree or more pregnancy loss before 10 wg and 165 women without reproductive failure have been evaluated for 677 C>T carrier status. Sixteen (15.1%) of women with pregnancy loss have had TT genotype and 54 (50.9%) are heterozygous carriers for T allele. T allele frequency was higher but not significant differ from carrier status in control group (13.9% for TT genotype and 43.9% for CT OR and 95% CI respectively 1.1, 0.52-2.3 u 1.34, 0.8-2.26, p > 0.05). T allele (in homozygous and heterozygous carriers) was in higher but not significant prevalence in patients compared with controls (66% and 57.6% respectively, OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.84-2.46, p > 0.05), This study found a weak association between T allele carrier status (both in homozygous and heterozygous state) and recurrent embryonic loss development. T allele in 677 C>T polymorphism could be considered like an agent for early pregnancy wastage only in a constellation with other risk factors influencing embryonic development.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy
