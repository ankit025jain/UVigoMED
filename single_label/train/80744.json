{"id":80744,"title":"Frequency of amoebiasis and other intestinal parasitoses in a settlement in Ilh√©us City, State of Bahia, Brazil.","abstract":"This study evaluated the frequency of intestinal parasites, emphasizing the identification and differentiation of Entamoeba spp.Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), coproantigen tests and morphometric analysis were performed for Entamoeba spp. differentiation.The overall frequency of intestinal parasites was 65%. Entamoeba histolytica was detected by the coproantigen test, and the PCR showed that Entamoeba dispar predominated in the population. In contrast, morphometric analysis was important for identifying Entamoeba hartmanni.It is possible to identify the causative agent of amoebiasis and to differentiate this agent from other species by combining techniques.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553799","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.861261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.697592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.50247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Entamoeba","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba"},{"name":"Intestinal parasite","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_parasite"},{"name":"Entamoeba histolytica","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"},{"name":"Amoebiasis","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebiasis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Bahia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Causative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative"},{"name":"Human settlement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"}]}
