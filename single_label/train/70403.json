{"id":70403,"title":"[Pingyangmycin injection under suspension laryngoscopy for giant hemangioma at hypopharynx and laryngeal in 12 cases hemangioma at hypopharynx and laryngeal in 12 cases].","abstract":"To explore the therapeutic methods and effect of pingyangmycin injection in huge hemangioma at Hypopharynx and laryngeal under suspension laryngoscopy.To ananysize the medical records of 12 Patients with giant hemangioma at hypopharynx and laryngeal. Patients were underwent polysomnography before operation. Inseted the suspension laryngoscopy to pars laryngea by mouth to exposing the hemangioma under general anaesthesia, then injected Pingyangmycin by a long-tube needling (one time per three weeks, accumulated dose less than 50 mg).Among all patients, ten were cured and two showed obvious improvement. The data of PSG after operation indicates that the symptom of anoxia of post-operation were significantly ameliorated than that of pre-operation, no recurrence occurred during one year follow-up of the hemangioma.The methods of pingyangmycin injection under suspension laryngoscopic surgery is significantly enhanced clinical effect and improved the life quality of patients with huge hemangioma, which with low risk, high security, can ameliorating anoxia, complete cure, and is a ideal therapeutic measure.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195276","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.868479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.654085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.606279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypopharynx","weight":0.451707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopharynx"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Paris Saint-Germain F.C.","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."},{"name":"Security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"}]}
