{"id":56492,"title":"Difluprednate 0.05% versus prednisolone acetate 1% for endogenous anterior uveitis: a phase III, multicenter, randomized study.","abstract":"Endogenous anterior uveitis (AU), when untreated, may lead to vision loss. This study compared the safety and efficacy of difluprednate versus prednisolone acetate for the treatment of this condition.This phase III, double-masked, noninferiority study randomized patients with mild to moderate endogenous AU to receive difluprednate 0.05% (n = 56) four times daily, alternating with vehicle four times daily, or prednisolone acetate 1% (n = 54) eight times daily. The 14-day treatment period was followed by a 14-day dose-tapering period and a 14-day observation period. The primary efficacy end point was change in anterior chamber cell grade (range, 0 for ?1 cell to 4 for >50 cells) from baseline to day 14.At day 14, the mean change in anterior chamber cell grade with difluprednate was noninferior to that with prednisolone acetate (-2.2 vs. -2.0, P = 0.16). The proportions of difluprednate-treated patients versus prednisolone acetate-treated patients demonstrating complete clearing of anterior chamber cells at day 3 were 13.0% vs. 2.1% (P = 0.046) and at day 21 were 73.9% vs. 63.8% (P = 0.013). A significant between-group difference in the mean IOP increase was seen at day 3 (2.5 mm Hg for difluprednate-treated patients and 0.1 mm Hg for prednisolone acetate-treated patients, P = 0.0013) but not at other time points. The mean IOP values in both groups remained less than 21 mm Hg throughout the study.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677110","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.607852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.594954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.497689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.111608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Astronomical unit","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Deforestation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"1 millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_millimetre"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"The 14","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_14"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Partial hospitalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_hospitalization"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"2011 Australian Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"}]}
