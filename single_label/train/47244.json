{"id":47244,"title":"Liver myofibroblasts up-regulate monocyte CD163 expression via PGE2 during hepatitis B induced liver failure.","abstract":"Although patients with liver failure exhibit a generalized inflammatory-imbalance status, substantial evidence indicates that this immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory state may be deleterious. Increased expression of CD163 (known to be involved in several anti-inflammatory functions of the immune system) in patients with liver failure is significantly correlated with a fatal outcome. However, little is known of the regulatory mechanisms that influence the expression of CD163.We assessed the expression of CD163 on monocytes from both circulating cells and the liver tissues of patients with hepatitis B induced liver failure using flow cytometry and isolated the myofibroblasts from diseased livers. The ability of human liver myofibroblasts to regulate CD163 expression on monocytes was studied in vitro.We showed that CD163? monocytes were enriched primarily in diseased livers and that they were associated with liver myofibroblasts in the same area. Accordingly, liver myofibroblasts were significantly superior to normal skin fibroblasts in inducing the expression of CD163 on monocytes in vitro. Moreover, we found that liver myofibroblasts triggered the activation of monocytes by secreting PGE2. Inhibition of PGE2 production in liver myofibroblasts using NS-398 markedly reduced CD163 expression in vitro.These results suggest that liver myofibroblasts play a direct role in regulating the expression of CD163 on monocytes in human liver tissues and thereby may regulate monocyte function during hepatitis B induced liver failure.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597777","annotations":[{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.643838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.616634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.605784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.564349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.338789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
