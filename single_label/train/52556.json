{"id":52556,"title":"Measurement of fine-needle aspiration thyroglobulin levels increases the detection of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma in cystic neck lesions.","abstract":"Patients with previously resected papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are monitored for disease recurrence/metastasis by ultrasound surveillance and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. However, accurate diagnosis in lesions with cystic degeneration may be difficult due to scant cellularity. In the current study, the authors evaluated thyroglobulin in FNA (Tg-FNA) for detecting metastatic and/or recurrent PTC in patients with cystic neck lesions after thyroidectomy.The pathology records were retrospectively searched for patients with previously resected PTC and subsequent Tg-FNA on a cystic neck mass. Tg-FNA was measured in needle rinses using a Tg assay. The ultrasound findings, Tg-FNA concentrations, and cytological and follow-up histological diagnoses were correlated.A total of 21 FNA specimens of cystic lesions from 19 patients were identified. Of 7 cases with cytologic and subsequent histologic diagnoses of metastatic PTC, the median Tg-FNA level was 100,982 ng/mL. Of 8 cytologically benign cases, 7 cases had Tg-FNA levels?<?0.2 ng/mL, and 1 aberrant case demonstrated elevated Tg-FNA of?>?1000 ng/mL. For 6 cytologically equivocal cases, including 3 classified as atypical/suspicious for carcinoma, 2 classified as insufficient/acellular debris, and 1 classified as spindle cell neoplasm, 4 patients demonstrated markedly elevated Tg-FNA levels (> 150 ng/mL) with subsequent surgical confirmation of metastatic PTC, whereas 2 patients had Tg-FNA levels of?<?0.2 ng/mL with negative follow-up. Using a cutoff value of 0.2 ng/mL, Tg-FNA demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 87.5%.Tg-FNA is a useful ancillary test that improves the detection of cystic PTC metastases. Particularly in cytologically nondiagnostic cases, the measurement of Tg-FNA helps to distinguish benign from malignant cystic lesions.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591483","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.842145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.827993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cytopathology","weight":0.822872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathology"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.752284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.616901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Spindle neuron","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron"}]}
