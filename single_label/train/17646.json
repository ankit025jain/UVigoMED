{"id":17646,"title":"Methods to prevent intraoperative hypothermia.","abstract":"Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia is by far the most commonly occurring anaesthesia-related complication. It can increase the risk of unfavourable events perioperatively. Higher rates of surgical site infections and blood transfusions, coagulation and drug metabolism disturbances are said to be the most relevant issues linked to this phenomenon. Although they have been available for several years now, dedicated systems designed to prevent it are still not part of routine anaesthesia conducted in Poland. This review aims to discuss the factors which may potentially increase the risk of hypothermia, and to present tools that are readily available and effective in perioperative temperature management.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858969","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.843613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.794355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.74799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.548198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.470446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.438402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.275537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
