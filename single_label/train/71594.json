{"id":71594,"title":"Trastuzumab-conjugated liposome-coated fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles to target breast cancer.","abstract":"To synthesize mesoporous silica-core-shell magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) encapsulated by liposomes (Lipo [MNP@m-SiO2]) in order to enhance their stability, allow them to be used in any buffer solution, and to produce trastuzumab-conjugated (Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2]-Her2Ab) nanoparticles to be utilized in vitro for the targeting of breast cancer.The physiochemical characteristics of Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2] were assessed in terms of size, morphological features, and in vitro safety. The multimodal imaging properties of the organic dye incorporated into Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2] were assessed with both in vitro fluorescence and MR imaging. The specific targeting ability of trastuzumab (Her2/neu antibody, HerceptinÂ®)-conjugated Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2] for Her2/neu-positive breast cancer cells was also evaluated with fluorescence and MR imaging.We obtained uniformly-sized and evenly distributed Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2] that demonstrated biological stability, while not disrupting cell viability. Her2/neu-positive breast cancer cell targeting by trastuzumab-conjugated Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2] was observed by in vitro fluorescence and MR imaging.Trastuzumab-conjugated Lipo[MNP@m-SiO2] is a potential treatment tool for targeted drug delivery in Her2/neu-positive breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25053899","annotations":[{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.766442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.620321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.605934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.599808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.492075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.413421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.380762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.378669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.299842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.23565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.166629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Molecular encapsulation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_encapsulation"}]}
