{"id":20368,"title":"Culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis related to Coxiella burnetii.","abstract":"The number of hip and knee arthroplasty procedures is steadily increasing as life expectancy increases. Coxiella burnetii may be responsible for culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis and is associated with antibiotic failure and repeated surgeries. We report the first case series of C. burnetii-related culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis.Cases were retrieved from the French National Referral center for Q fever. Diagnosis was based on (18)fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, serology, broad-range polymerase chain reaction, and C. burnetii-specific polymerase chain reaction.Four cases of C. burnetii-related culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis were found. Standard bacteriologic procedures would have missed the diagnosis in all cases. Etiologic diagnosis improved the outcome in all but 1 case.A systematic, comprehensive diagnostic strategy should be used in culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis, including testing for C. burnetii in endemic areas.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662624","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.496877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Q fever","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_fever"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.341771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.335029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"France","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Coxiella burnetii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxiella_burnetii"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
