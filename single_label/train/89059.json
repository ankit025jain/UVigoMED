{"id":89059,"title":"[Successful conservative management of blunt renal rupture in a girl].","abstract":"An 11-year-old girl visited the emergency room of our hospital with complaints of pain, nausea and gross hematuria after abdominal injury due to a fall from a fence. Computed tomography (CT) showed ruptured right kidney, hematoma, urinoma, and slight liver damage in S7 area. According to the Classification of Renal Injury by the Japanese Association for the Surgery of Trauma, this case was Type IIIb, but according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Organ Injury Severity Scale for the Kidney, it was Type V. Because her vital signs were stable after admission, conservative management was initiated. There was no progression of anemia, and blood transfusion was not required. Right ureteral stenting was performed on the 4th hospital day because of an increase in fluid accumulation around the right kidney. Percutaneous drainage was performed on the 9th hospital day because of a further increase in fluid accumulation around the right kidney. After percutaneous drainage, fluid accumulation around the kidney was improved, and the drainage tube was removed on the 20th hospital day. The patient was discharged on the 22nd day. Although the decreased blood flow in the ruptured portion of the right kidney was observed in a subsequent CT scan, renal scintigraphy showed a relatively well maintained function of the right kidney (split renal function; right 38% and left 62%). She had no increase in blood pressure one year after renal injury.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Wounds and
