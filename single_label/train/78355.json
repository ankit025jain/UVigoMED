{"id":78355,"title":"Enhanced hearing in noise for cochlear implant recipients: clinical trial results for a commercially available speech-enhancement strategy.","abstract":"To demonstrate benefits for speech perception and everyday listening in quiet and in noise with a speech-enhancement strategy called ClearVoice, which was designed to improve listening in complex acoustic environments without compromising hearing in quiet.A 2-week randomized crossover design was used to evaluate ClearVoice in 46 adults unilaterally implanted with a CII/HiRes 90K cochlear implant who had at least 6 months experience with HiRes Fidelity 120 sound processing. Speech perception was assessed using the AzBio sentences presented in quiet, in speech-spectrum noise and in multitalker babble. Subjective listening benefit and strategy preference were assessed with a questionnaire. ClearVoice has 3 gain settings (low, medium, and high), each intended as a full-time listening option according to individual preference. Speech understanding after acute use of ClearVoice-low was compared with HiRes Fidelity 120 during an initial test session. Speech perception abilities were compared with HiRes Fidelity 120 after 2 weeks of exclusive use of ClearVoice-medium, and after 2 weeks of exclusive use of ClearVoice-high. During a fifth week, participants were fit with 3 programs for comparison (HiRes Fidelity 120, ClearVoice-medium, and ClearVoice-high), after which, they reported preference and everyday listening benefits via a questionnaire.ClearVoice significantly improved speech understanding in speech-spectrum noise and multitalker babble, did not compromise listening in quiet, was preferred for everyday listening, and provided improved hearing in real-life situations.ClearVoice improves hearing in noise for cochlear implant recipients who use HiRes Fidelity 120 sound processing.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691504","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.496419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.453591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.197222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Speech perception","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception"},{"name":"Sexual selection","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0499462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Sentence (linguistics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Audio signal processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Real options valuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_options_valuation"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Babbling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbling"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Resolution_Fly's_Eye_Cosmic_Ray_Detector"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Audio crossover","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_crossover"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Fidelity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"}]}
