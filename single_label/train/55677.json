{"id":55677,"title":"Sleep deprivation reduces tear secretion and impairs the tear film.","abstract":"We investigated whether sleep deprivation (SD) disturbs the tear film.A total of 20 healthy male subjects with no ocular disease was recruited: 10 were allocated to the SD group and 10 to the control group The 10 subjects in the SD group were deprived of sleep in an experimental setting and their outcomes were compared to those of the control group, which was not sleep-deprived. Tear film and ocular surface were evaluated at 2 PM, 10 PM, and 6 AM and 2 PM the following day. Tear osmolarity, Schirmer's test, tear film break-up time (TBUT), pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), and IOP were measured.At 6 AM the following day, mean tear osmolarity level increased (P = 0.004), TBUT was significantly shorter (P = 0.01), and tear secretion measured by Schirmer's test was significantly reduced in the SD group than in the control group (P = 0.004). No significant change in IOP was observed in either group.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833736","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sleep deprivation","weight":0.562585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.562025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.235821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.175171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Osmolarity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmolarity"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Prime minister","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister"},{"name":"Standard-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Gondwana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana"},{"name":"Amplitude modulation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Tear (Wheel of Time)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_(Wheel_of_Time)"}]}
