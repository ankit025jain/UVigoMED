{"id":43018,"title":"CBRH-7919 cell supernate promotes fibroblasts to express cyclooxygenase-2 and hepatocyte growth factor.","abstract":"Transplanted cells need a microenvironment for proliferation and neovascularization. As an important component of the microenvironment, fibroblasts play a role in the process of tumor growth. With that in mind, we planned to activate fibroblasts in vitro and investigate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which can promote the proliferation and neovascularization of the transplanted liver cells.Fibroblasts were isolated from 20-day-old fetal Sprague-Dawley rats and incubated in the absence or presence of rat hepatoma CBRH-7919 cell supernate. On days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 the incubated fibroblasts were taken for detection of the levels of HGF and COX-2 by immunocytochemistry and the levels of HGF mRNA and COX-2 mRNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.When incubated in the presence of CBRH-7919 cell supernate, the fibroblasts could be activated to myofibroblasts that expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin at a high level, and the fibroblasts expressed COX-2, COX-2 mRNA, HGF, and HGF mRNA at higher levels, reaching a peak on day 3 and maintained at high levels until on day 7.Fibroblasts can be activated by CBRH-7919 cell supernate. Activated fibroblasts can express COX-2 and HGF at higher levels. Maybe we can take advantage of the activated fibroblasts to promote the neovascularization and proliferation of transplanted liver cells.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815169","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.760474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatocyte growth factor","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.497682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.40081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.222685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"}]}
