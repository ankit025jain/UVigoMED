{"id":67454,"title":"Symptomatic perineural cyst: report of two cases treated with cyst-subarachnoid shunts.","abstract":"Symptomatic perineural cysts are rare. Resection and closure of such cysts sometimes results in postoperative neurological deficits and they can recur. We report two cases of symptomatic perineural cysts treated with subarachnoid shunts.Case 1: A 62-year-old woman presented with bladder dysfunction. We identified a cyst communicating with the subarachnoid space adjacent to the S2 nerve root and implanted a subarachnoid shunt. Seven years after this surgery, her bladder dysfunction had not recurred. Case 2: A 35-year-old woman had low back pain, radiculopathy and bladder dysfunction. We identified a cyst adjacent to the S1 nerve root and implanted a subarachnoid shunt. Her low back pain and radiculopathy improved immediately and she experienced neither postoperative neurological deficits nor recurrence.Cyst-subarachnoid shunts are a useful treatment option for symptomatic perineural cysts.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614981","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.778971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Nerve root","weight":0.605737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_root"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.58201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.518953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiculopathy","weight":0.318736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiculopathy"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.191521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0411881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Perineurium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineurium"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"A35 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A35_autoroute"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 62","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_62"}]}
