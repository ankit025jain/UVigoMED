{"id":87598,"title":"Computed tomography arthrography with traction in the human hip for three-dimensional reconstruction of cartilage and the acetabular labrum.","abstract":"To develop and demonstrate the efficacy of a computed tomography arthrography (CTA) protocol for the hip that enables accurate three-dimensional reconstructions of cartilage and excellent visualization of the acetabular labrum.Ninety-three subjects were imaged (104 scans); 68 subjects with abnormal anatomy, 11 patients after periacetabular osteotomy surgery, and 25 subjects with normal anatomy. Fifteen to 25 ml of contrast agent diluted with lidocaine was injected using a lateral oblique approach. A Hare traction splint applied traction during CT. The association between traction force and intra-articular joint space was assessed qualitatively under fluoroscopy. Cartilage geometry was reconstructed from the CTA images for 30 subjects; the maximum joint space under traction was measured.Using the Hare traction splint, the intra-articular space and boundaries of cartilage could be clearly delineated throughout the joint; the acetabular labrum was also visible. Dysplastic hips required less traction (?5 kg) than normal and retroverted hips required (>10 kg) to separate the cartilage. An increase in traction force produced a corresponding widening of the intra-articular joint space. Under traction, the maximum width of the intra-articular joint space during CT ranged from 0.98-6.7 mm (2.46 Â± 1.16 mm).When applied to subjects with normal and abnormal hip anatomy, the CTA protocol presented yields clear delineation of the cartilage and the acetabular labrum. Use of a Hare traction splint provides a simple, cost-effective method to widen the intra-articular joint space during CT, and provides flexibility to vary the traction as required.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070373","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.885128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acetabular labrum","weight":0.625095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabular_labrum"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.546241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Arthrogram","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogram"},{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.200243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Glenoid labrum","weight":0.186991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_labrum"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"16 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film"},{"name":"Traction splint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_splint"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Flexibility (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"List of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chicago_Transit_Authority_bus_routes"},{"name":"Hare","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare"},{"name":"Retroverted uterus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroverted_uterus"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"}]}
