{"id":55547,"title":"Fluorescein angiography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography for monitoring anti-VEGF therapy in myopic choroidal neovascularization.","abstract":"To evaluate the agreement between fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in detecting myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) activity during bevacizumab treatment.Thirty-four patients with subfoveal myopic CNV were prospectively enrolled. FA and SD-OCT were performed at baseline and at all planned monthly visits. After the first injection, additional treatments were administered following detection of fluid on SD-OCT and/or leakage on FA. ?-Analysis was performed to examine the agreement between FA and SD-OCT.At baseline, FA and SD-OCT agreed in 26/34 cases (?=0.23); sensitivity and specificity were 77.4 and 66.7%, respectively. Seven eyes presented leakage on FA with no fluid on SD-OCT, 1 case showed intraretinal fluid on SD-OCT and no leakage on FA. At the 1-month examination, specificity and ?-value improved, and 30/34 cases showed complete concordance. At the 3- and 4-month examinations, a discordance was noted in 6 cases. From the 5-month examination on, a correspondence was achieved in at least 30/34 cases and reached a perfect match in 11 sessions.Our study confirms the key role of FA in diagnosing myopic CNV. It seems possible there may be a role for SD-OCT in assisting FA to monitor the myopic CNV activity during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody treatment.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861045","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.701459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.459099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.410315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0546422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.040567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Window function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"}]}
