{"id":63200,"title":"[Acute-onset thrombocytopenia following single inhalation xylene exposure--a case report].","abstract":"Bone marrow damage is a well known consequence of chronic exposure to benzene and its homologues, which include xylene. Anemia dominates in the clinical picture and isolated thrombocytopenia is a rare symptom. We have not found reports of isolated thrombocytopenia in the course of acute xylene poisoning. A 56-years old man with thrombocytopenia, was admitted, after two days of work with concrete floor paint containing up to 17% xylene. The thrombocytes' nadir (29 x 10(9)/L) occurred on the fourth day from the exposure. After treatment with dexamethasone the platelet count normalized. There were no signs of hemorrhagic diathesis. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of thrombocytopenia in patients acutely exposed to xylene.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466720","annotations":[{"name":"Benzene","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Bleeding diathesis","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_diathesis"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Xylene","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylene"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0384911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Paint","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"}]}
