{"id":24735,"title":"Translational studies of A20 in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest killer in the Western World despite significant advances in understanding its molecular underpinnings. Chronic inflammation, the classical hallmark of atherogenesis is thought to play a key pathogenic role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions from initiation of fatty streaks to plaque rupture. Over-representation of mostly pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) target genes within atherosclerotic lesions has led to the common-held belief that excessive NF-kappaB activity promotes and aggravates atherogenesis. However, mouse models lacking various proteins involved in NF-kappaB signaling have often resulted in conflicting findings, fueling additional investigations to uncover the molecular involvement of NF-kappaB and its target genes in atherogenesis. In this chapter we will review the role of the NF-kappaB-regulated, yet potent NF-kappaB inhibitory and anti-inflammatory gene A20/TNFAIP3 in atherogenesis, and highlight the potential use of its atheroprotective properties for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25302367","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.653936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.642772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.567928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.526962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.486741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Fatty streak","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_streak"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
