{"id":45247,"title":"Development of nalidixic acid amphotericin B vancomycin (NAV) medium for the isolation of Campylobacter ureolyticus from the stools of patients presenting with acute gastroenteritis.","abstract":"Recently, Campylobacter ureolyticus has been detected for the first time in the faeces of patients with acute gastroenteritis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Cultural isolation of C. ureolyticusis is not possible using the established selective methods for the isolation of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. from faeces. The aim of the current study is to develop a new selective medium capable of isolating C. ureolyticus from faecal samples. The newly-developed medium consists of Anaerobe Basal Agar with 10 g/L additional agar, 2 g/L sodium formate and 3 g/L sodium fumarate dibasic, to which 10 mg/L nalidixic acid, 10 mg/L amphotericin B and 20 mg/L vancomycin (NAV) are added as selective agents. Validation studies have shown that this experimental selective medium completely inhibits growth of Candida spp. and of Enterococcus spp. and permits reduced growth of selected coliforms and Proteus spp. Growth of Campylobacter ureolyticus on NAV medium is optimal in anaerobic and enriched hydrogen atmospheres. Additionally, an overnight enrichment step using Bolton broth to which 2 g/L sodium formate, 3 g/L sodium fumarate dibasic and the NAV supplement are added, in place of the commercial Bolton broth supplement, allows improved recovery of C. ureolyticus from patients' faeces.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System
