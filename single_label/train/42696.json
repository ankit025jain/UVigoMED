{"id":42696,"title":"Image quality improvement in submillisievert computed tomographic colonography using a fast 3-dimensional noise reduction method.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the image quality in submillisievert computed tomographic colonography (CTC) images using a structure preserving diffusion denoising method.Image quality was compared before and after denoising in 31 patients. One hundred twenty-kilovolt, 30-mAs prone CTC scans were used as reference and compared with submillisievert 140-kV, 10-mAs supine scans. Two readers assessed 2-dimensional and endoluminal image quality. The image noise and the signal-to-noise ratio were measured.After denoising, image quality scores improved in both supine series and prone series (P < 0.0001), with the submillisievert denoised images being equal to or better than the native prone reference images. In both the supine images and the prone images, the noise was reduced by a factor of 2 and the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly higher (P < 0.001). The signal-to-noise ratio in the denoised submillisievert images was higher than those in the native prone images (P < 0.001).The structure preserving diffusion denoising method preserves the image quality in submillisievert CTC images compared with the native 30-mAs reference images.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834893","annotations":[{"name":"Image noise","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Noise reduction","weight":0.142583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Virtual colonoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_colonoscopy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Imaging science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_science"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Phred quality score","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score"},{"name":"Fruit preserves","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"}]}
