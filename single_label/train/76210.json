The fortified salt contained iron, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and folic acid. All the children were dewormed at baseline and at the end of the study just before the biochemical measurements.There was a significant improvement in most biochemical parameters studied in the micronutrient group when compared with the control group whereas this was not seen between the education and control. Over 8 months, in the micronutrient group, hemoglobin increased by 0.52 g/dL, retinol by 8.56 ?g/dL, ferritin by 10.8 ?g/L, body iron stores by 1.27 mg and the decrease in the prevalence of retinol deficiency was from 51.6% to 28.1%, anaemia from 46.0% to 32.6%, iron deficiency from 66.9% to 51.3% and iron deficiency anaemia from 35.2% to 31.0%, while the prevalence of all these deficiencies increased or the changes were not significant in the other two groups.Multiple micronutrient fortified salt was able to improve iron and vitamin A status, whereas this was not seen in the nutrition education group.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164452","annotations":[{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Iron deficiency anemia","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.847389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Retinol","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"},{"name":"India","weight":0.801988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.712613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.253823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.23283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Tamil Nadu","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"}]}
