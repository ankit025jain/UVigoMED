{"id":91244,"title":"New modified Achilles tendon allograft for treatment of chronic patellar tendon ruptures following total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"Patellar tendon rupture is an infrequent but debilitating lesion. Several surgical repairs have been suggested for patellar tendon rupture. Our aim is to propose a modified technique from the classic Achilles allograft procedure.Five consecutive patients diagnosed with chronic patellar tendon rupture following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were included in the presented study. All patients were operated with a modified Achilles allograft technique, dividing the Achilles tendon into two bundles and overcrossing these through the distal part of the quadricipital tendon.All patients regained their extension mechanism and have discontinued using crutches. No complications were observed.The modified Achilles allograft has shown to be a safe, time-reducing repair for chronic patellar tendon ruptures following TKA, and should be considered as an alternative surgical repair.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525798","annotations":[{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.842279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.395624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Tendinosis","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinosis"},{"name":"Patellar ligament","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_ligament"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patellar tendon rupture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_tendon_rupture"},{"name":"TKA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKA"},{"name":"Crutch","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crutch"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Ruptured spleen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruptured_spleen"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"}]}
