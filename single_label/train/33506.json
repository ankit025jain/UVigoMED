{"id":33506,"title":"Skin pH, atopic dermatitis, and filaggrin mutations.","abstract":"The acidic pH of the skin plays a role in antimicrobial defense by regulating the bacterial skin flora and aspects of barrier. Filaggrin is a co-factor in maintaining a low skin pH because of its degradation into acidic amino acids. Accordingly, lack of filaggrin due to filaggrin mutations may influence skin pH.We aimed to determine the epidermal pH in different groups stratified by filaggrin mutations and atopic dermatitis. Further, we investigated the changes in pH according to severity of mutational status among patients with dermatitis, irrespective of skin condition.pH was measured with a multiprobe system pH probe (PH 905), and the study population was composed of 67 individuals, who had all been genotyped for 3 filaggrin mutations (R501X, 2282del4, R2447X).We found no clear pattern in relation to filaggrin mutation carrier status. Individuals with wild-type filaggrin displayed both the most acidic and most alkaline values independent of concomitant skin disease; however, no statistical differences between the groups were found.The lack of significant diversity in skin pH in relation to filaggrin mutation carrier status suggests that the effect of filaggrin mutations on skin pH is not pronounced.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819286","annotations":[{"name":"Skin flora","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.722493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.662605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.547712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.13428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0365959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Filaggrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filaggrin"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
