{"id":47280,"title":"[Screening for colorectal cancer in Japan: how could we reach the goal?].","abstract":"Screening programs for colorectal cancer have long been conducted in Japan using immunochemical fecal occult blood testing. The present issue with promotion of anti-colorectal-cancer strategy through cancer screening is how we could reach the goal of mortality reduction. Construction of organized screening programs, which is the strategy for reducing cancer mortality through screening, is vital for the purpose. Development of new screening tests and risk stratification strategy are also important issues on this matter.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597343","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Fecal occult blood","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_occult_blood"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.65,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.454756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.405151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.265507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.13988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Immunoelectrophoresis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoelectrophoresis"}]}
