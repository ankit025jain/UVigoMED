{"id":61551,"title":"Pilot study of an assessment tool for measuring head and neck lymphoedema.","abstract":"Head and neck lymphoedema (HNL) is a persistent symptom for many patients following head and neck cancer treatment. There is limited research into the benefits of lymphoedema treatment with this population. This pilot study (n=8) employs the Assessment of Lymphoedema of Head and Neck (ALOHA) system to evaluate treatment changes in this clinical population. The ALOHA assessment combines the use of the Princess Alexandra Hospital tape measurement system and the use of Tissue Dielectric Constant (MoistureMeterD) to measure HNL. Baseline measures were taken at the start of treatment and were repeated when the participants had reduced one level on the MD Anderson Cancer Centre HNL rating scale. The MoistureMeterD and three of the four tape measurement points showed a statistically significant change over time. This indicates the ALOHA system was useful in objectively detecting changes associated with clinical improvements.
