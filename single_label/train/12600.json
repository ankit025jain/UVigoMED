{"id":12600,"title":"Myosins 1 and 6, myosin light chain kinase, actin and microtubules cooperate during antibody-mediated internalisation and trafficking of membrane-expressed viral antigens in feline infectious peritonitis virus infected monocytes.","abstract":"Monocytes infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus, a coronavirus, express viral proteins in their plasma membranes. Upon binding of antibodies, these proteins are quickly internalised through a new clathrin- and caveolae-independent internalisation pathway. By doing so, the infected monocytes can escape antibody-dependent cell lysis. In the present study, we investigated which kinases and cytoskeletal proteins are of importance during internalisation and subsequent intracellular transport. The experiments showed that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin 1 are crucial for the initiation of the internalisation. With co-localisation stainings, it was found that MLCK and myosin 1 co-localise with antigens even before internalisation started. Myosin 6 co-localised with the internalising complexes during passage through the cortical actin, were it might play a role in moving or disintegrating actin filaments, to overcome the actin barrier. One minute after internalisation started, vesicles had passed the cortical actin, co-localised with microtubules and association with myosin 6 was lost. The vesicles were further transported over the microtubules and accumulated at the microtubule organising centre after 10 to 30 min. Intracellular trafficking over microtubules was mediated by MLCK, myosin 1 and a small actin tail. Since inhibiting MLCK with ML-7 was so efficient in blocking the internalisation pathway, this target can be used for the development of a new treatment for FIPV.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517254","annotations":[{"name":"Microtubule","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule"},{"name":"Clathrin","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin"},{"name":"Myosin","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Microfilament","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfilament"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.780873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.778631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.645175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.541117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.526101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.476666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.447072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.383737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Receptor-mediated endocytosis","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor-mediated_endocytosis"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Myosin light-chain kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin_light-chain_kinase"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Protein filament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_filament"}]}
