{"id":1006,"title":"[Applications of platelets in studies on traditional Chinese medicines promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis].","abstract":"Thrombotic diseases in different forms become a great threat to human health. Such anti-platelet aggregation drugs as aspirin and clopidogrel are common drugs in clinic. However, along with the appearance of resistance and side effects of western anti-platelet aggregation drugs, anti-platelet aggregation traditional Chinese medicines promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis have gradually become an important study orientation. Platelet is one of major participant in thrombosis, and plays an important role as a bioactive material in studies on traditional Chinese medicines promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, mainly involving two aspects--the evaluation for the anti-platelet aggregation activity of traditional Chinese medicines and the screening of their active components. This paper summarized the applications of platelets in studies on traditional Chinese medicines promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, so as to provide basis for further studies.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509277","annotations":[{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.870827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.807009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.78525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.72498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.355971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.293064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.191855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Stasis (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Applied mathematics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics"}]}
