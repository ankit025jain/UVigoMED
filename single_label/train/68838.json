{"id":68838,"title":"Noncardiovascular mortality in CKD: an epidemiological perspective.","abstract":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased risk of all-cause mortality; the elevated cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease is particularly well documented. Lately, the increased noncardiovascular mortality in these patients has gained particular attention. In this article, both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality in CKD are discussed, with specific attention paid to studies that provide details of noncardiovascular causes of death. Examples are provided of several cardiovascular risk factors that also seem to be associated with noncardiovascular mortality, including levels of fetuin-A, troponin T, and C-reactive protein, as well as vitamin D deficiency and proteinuria. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms (such as inflammatory reactions and the uraemic milieu) that might explain the increased cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality in CKD are also discussed. Future research should not only focus on preventing cardiovascular mortality, but also on studying noncardiovascular mortality and the potential link between causal pathways of cardiovascular mortality and noncardiovascular mortality in CKD.
