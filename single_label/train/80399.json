{"id":80399,"title":"Helminth-associated systemic immune activation and HIV co-receptor expression: response to albendazole/praziquantel treatment.","abstract":"It has been hypothesized that helminth infections increase HIV susceptibility by enhancing systemic immune activation and hence contribute to elevated HIV-1 transmission in sub-Saharan Africa.To study systemic immune activation and HIV-1 co-receptor expression in relation to different helminth infections and in response to helminth treatment.HIV-negative adults with (n?=?189) or without (n?=?57) different helminth infections, as diagnosed by Kato-Katz, were enrolled in Mbeya, Tanzania. Blinded to helminth infection status, T cell differentiation (CD45RO, CD27), activation (HLA-DR, CD38) and CCR5 expression was determined at baseline and 3 months after Albendazole/Praziquantel treatment. Plasma cytokine levels were compared using a cytometric bead array.Trichuris and Ascaris infections were linked to increased frequencies of \"activated\" CD4 and/or CD8 T cells (p<0.05), whereas Hookworm infection was associated with a trend towards decreased HLA-DR+ CD8 T cell frequencies (p?=?0.222). In Trichuris infected subjects, there was a linear correlation between HLA-DR+ CD4 T cell frequencies and the cytokines IL-1? and IL-10 (p<0.05). Helminth treatment with Albendazole and Praziquantel significantly decreased eosinophilia for S. mansoni and Hookworm infections (p<0.005) but not for Trichuris infection and only moderately modulated T cell activation. CCR5 surface density on memory CD4 T cells was increased by 1.2-fold during Trichuris infection (p-value: 0.053) and reduced after treatment (p?=?0.003).Increased expression of T cell activation markers was associated with Trichuris and Ascaris infections with relatively little effect of helminth treatment.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675895","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.827614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"CCR5","weight":0.78094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5"},{"name":"Co-receptor","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-receptor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"CD27","weight":0.726801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD27"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Albendazole","weight":0.673311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albendazole"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.658539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.641133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.573269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.316904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.289481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.104326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Trichinosis","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Tanzania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"CD38","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD38"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"}]}
