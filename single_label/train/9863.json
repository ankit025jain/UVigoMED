{"id":9863,"title":"Evaluation of biomarkers for osteoarthritis caused by fragmented medial coronoid process in dogs.","abstract":"The aim of the present work was to evaluate whether concentrations of the carboxy-terminal cross-linked fragment of type II collagen (CTX-II), the activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2/-9) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) in canine synovial fluids (SF) can reflect structural alterations of articular cartilage in dogs with fragmented medial coronoid process (FMCP). Elbow joints with FMCP underwent radiographic and arthroscopic examination. Commercially available assays were used to analyze SF for CTX-II concentration and MMP-2/-9 activity. MPO activity was measured by o-dianisidine-assay. The MMPs were further evaluated by zymography. CTX-II concentration and MMP-2 activity showed age-dependent trends in controls. Increased enzyme activities of MPO and MMP-2/-9 were found in diseased dogs. MMP-9activity seems suitable to underline the subjective assessment of the degree of cartilage damage. These initial data of the study suggest that MPO and MMP-2/9 may be used as objective biomarkers in the diagnosis of canine osteoarthritis due to FMCP.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684895","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.92209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.906426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.587088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.483123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.462025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.382246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.328276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.149844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0711915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Coronoid process of the ulna","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronoid_process_of_the_ulna"},{"name":"Type-II collagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-II_collagen"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Multi-Man Publishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Man_Publishing"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Underline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underline"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Coronoid process of the mandible","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronoid_process_of_the_mandible"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
