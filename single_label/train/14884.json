{"id":14884,"title":"The genome sequence of a novel simian adenovirus in a chimpanzee reveals a close relationship to human adenoviruses.","abstract":"Recently, several reports have revealed that some simian adenoviruses (AdVs) strains show a close relationship to human AdVs. In the present study, a simian AdV strain named SAdV-ch1 was detected in chimpanzees in China, and its complete genome was determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed SAdV-ch1 clustering in a clade that was separate from all of the other simian AdVs but genetically close to a human AdV strain, HAdV-18 (GenBank no. GU191019), sharing 92.5 % sequence identity with it. Recombination analysis provided evidence that a recombination event had occurred between SAdV-ch1 and HAdV-61 (JF964962), where SAdV-ch1 exchanged partial of its hexon gene segment with HAdV-61, leading to the recombinant HAdV-31 (AM749299).","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398862","annotations":[{"name":"Chimpanzee","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.853642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Clade","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Simian","weight":0.702541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.61122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.423525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.361224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.151817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}]}
