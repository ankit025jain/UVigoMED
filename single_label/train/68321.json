{"id":68321,"title":"Age-dependent association between Dickkopf-1 and calcium-containing urolithiasis.","abstract":"To evaluate the serum Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) level in patients with calcium-containing upper urinary tract stones (Ca-UUTS).The study retrospectively enrolled 184 patients with Ca-UUTS and 46 age-matched controls. The serum DKK1 level and urine calcium/creatinine ratio were detected in both groups.The mean serum DKK1 level in the controls was 321.7 ± 284.1 pg/mL, which was significantly lower than that of the patients with calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (CaOx + CaP), CaOx, and CaP stones (687.8 ± 600.2, 640.5 ± 721.5, and 857.9 ± 913.2 pg/mL, respectively). The mean urine calcium/creatinine ratio, an indicator of hypercalciuria, was higher in the Ca-UUTS patients with CaOx + CaP (0.10 ± 0.06), CaOx (0.13 ± 0.07), and CaP (0.12 ± 0.07) stones than in the controls (0.08 ± 0.04). Statistical significance was noted only in the patients with CaOx (P = .005) and CaP (P = .037) stones. A significant positive association was found between the serum DKK1 level and age in the control group but not in the Ca-UUTS patients. In subjects aged younger than 50 years, the serum DKK1 level in the Ca-UUTS group was significantly higher than in the control group (605.3 ± 514.4 vs 274 ± 229.8 pg/mL, P = .0003). The serum DKK1 level was not associated with stone size.Serum DKK1, an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, was positively associated with the formation of Ca-UUTS, especially in patients aged younger than 50 years.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529587","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium oxalate","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_oxalate"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.841687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Oxalate","weight":0.807664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.77432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Hypercalciuria","weight":0.717506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalciuria"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.689325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.451624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.216497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Danish krone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_krone"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Urolithiasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolithiasis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"284","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/284"},{"name":"857","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/857"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"721","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/721"},{"name":"913","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/913"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 687","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_687"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"}]}
