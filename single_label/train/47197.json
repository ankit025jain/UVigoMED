{"id":47197,"title":"Role of iron overload-induced macrophage apoptosis in the pathogenesis of peritoneal endometriosis.","abstract":"This article presents an overview of the involvement of iron overload-induced nitric oxide (NO) overproduction in apoptosis of peritoneal macrophages of women with endometriosis. We have postulated that the peritoneal iron overload originated from retrograde menstruation or bleeding lesions in the ectopic endometrium, which may contribute to the development of endometriosis by a wide range of mechanisms, including oxidative damage and chronic inflammation. Excessive NO production may also be associated with impaired clearance of endometrial cells by macrophages, which promotes cell growth in the peritoneal cavity. Therefore, further research of the mechanisms and consequences of macrophage apoptosis in endometriosis helps discover novel therapeutic strategies that are designed to prevent progression of endometriosis.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599836","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Menstruation","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Peritoneal cavity","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_cavity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.554032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Iron overload","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.12173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Myeloproliferative disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0116672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
