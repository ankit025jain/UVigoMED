{"id":36169,"title":"Damus anastomosis associated with REV/Rastelli procedure allows to extend indications for anatomical repair in complex transposition of great arteries.","abstract":"We report here the indications and the results of a surgical option associating a Damus procedure with a 'Réparation à l'Etage Ventriculaire' (REV)/Rastelli procedure, for anatomical repair of patients presenting with complex transposition of great arteries (TGA), restrictive/remote ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary stenosis (PS). Five consecutive patients (median age: 11 months (range: 20 days to 15 years)) presenting with complex TGA-VSD-PS and anatomical lesions resulting in a contraindication to a Nikaidoh procedure were included. Two of them presented with a postoperative restrictive left ventricle-to-aorta baffle and secondarily underwent a modified Damus procedure a few days after the REV or Rastelli procedure. In the other 3 patients, the Damus procedure was primarily performed at the time of the REV or Rastelli procedure. No death occurred. At the last follow-up (mean: 31 ± 37 months), all patients displayed an excellent functional status and an unobstructed left ventricular outflow tract in echocardiography. Associating a Damus procedure with a REV/Rastelli procedure can be considered as an effective and low-risk surgical option to extend the indications for anatomical repair in patients with complex TGA-VSD-PS and anatomical findings precluding other surgical options.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595246","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.810292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pulmonic stenosis","weight":0.776439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonic_stenosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Transposition of the great vessels","weight":0.660461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_vessels"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.647562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.605722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.545761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.480203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.224485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Great arteries","weight":0.187221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_arteries"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.173767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Outflow (meteorology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Iomega REV","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iomega_REV"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"}]}
