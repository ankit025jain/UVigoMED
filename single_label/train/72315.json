{"id":72315,"title":"Significance of syndecan-1 expression in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.","abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) supports tumor progression in breast cancer. FGF-2 signaling is modulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as syndecan-1 (CD138). The exact role of CD138 in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS) is still uncertain. Differential expression depending on grading could suggest a role for syndecan-1 during growth and tumor progression.Samples of 127 cases of breast DCIS associated with follow-up data were included. CD138 staining intensity, number of positive cells, intracellular and tissue localization were examined.Median follow-up was 45.4 months and median recurrence-free survival (RFS) 86 months. Age, menopausal status and previous hormone replacement therapy had no significant influence on RFS. Smoking significantly influenced RFS (p=0.008). Endocrine therapy or radiotherapy did not improve RFS. Grading was not correlated with CD138 staining intensity, but was significantly associated with the percentage of CD138-positive cells (low-vs. high-grade, p=0.043). Estrogen receptor (ER) expression did not influence staining intensity of CD138 (p=0.247), but negatively correlated with the proportion of CD138-positive cells (p=0.032). Progesterone receptor (PR) expression significantly influenced the intensity of staining (p=0.010) and the percentage of CD138-positive cells (p=0.004); both were increased in PR-negative cases. CD138 staining intensity and percentage of positive cells did not correlate with RFS. Nuclear grade and syndecan-1 staining localization were significantly associated (p=0.001). ER-positive, and PR-positive DCIS more often exhibited membrane-bound syndecan-1 than ER- or PR-negative cases (p=0.001). Nuclear grade and tissue localization of CD138 correlated significantly (p=0.005). PR influenced CD138 tissue distribution, while ER did not. Syndecan-1 localization did not statistically impact RFS.In DCIS of different nuclear grades, tissue localization of syndecan-1 is significantly divergent, suggesting a specific effect on biology and progression of DCIS.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982376","annotations":[{"name":"Heparan
