{"id":36759,"title":"In vivo expression of ephrinA5-Fc in mice results in cephalic neural crest agenesis and craniofacial abnormalities.","abstract":"Eph receptors and their ligands ephrins have been implicated in guiding the directed migration of neural crest cells (NCCs). In this study, we found that Wnt1-Cre-mediated expression of ephrinA5-Fc along the dorsal midline of the dien- and mesencephalon resulted in severe craniofacial malformation of mouse embryo. Interestingly, expression of cephalic NCC markers decreased significantly in the frontonasal process and branchial arches 1 and 2, which are target areas for the migratory cephalic NCCs originating in the dien- and mesencephalon. In addition, these craniofacial tissues were much smaller in mutant embryos expressing ephrinA5-Fc. Importantly, EphA7-positive cephalic NCCs were absent along the dorsal dien- and mesencephalon of mutant embryos expressing ephrinA5-Fc, suggesting that the generation of cephalic NCCs is disrupted due to ephrinA5-Fc expression. NCC explant experiments suggested that ephrinA5-Fc perturbed survival of cephalic NCC precursors in the dorsal midline tissue rather than affecting their migratory capacity, which was consistent with our previous report that expression of ephrinA5-Fc in the dorsal midline is responsible for severe neuroepithelial cell apoptotic death. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that expression of ephrinA5-Fc decreases a population of cephalic NCC precursors in the dorsal midline of the dien- and mesencephalon, thereby disrupting craniofacial development in the mouse embryos.
