{"id":14304,"title":"Comparision of osteoconductivity of biologic and artificial synthetic hydroxyapatite in experimental mastoid obliteration.","abstract":"To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study to address the comparison between biologic hydroxyapatite (BHA) and artificial HA (AHA) materials for mastoid obliteration. From our results, it is believed that BHA has better osteoconductivity than AHA.The purpose of this study was to compare the osteoconductivity of AHA and BHA in a mastoid obliteration model in rats.BHA and AHA were fabricated. Bulla obliteration was carried out in group A (n = 10, BHA) and group B (n = 10, AHA). The animals were administered fluorescent bone labels for a qualitative evaluation of bone formation. Oxytetracycline hydrochloride was administered at 2 weeks, calcein at 4 weeks, and alizarin red at 8 weeks. The animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks post surgery. They were evaluated by micro-CT and histological investigation.Neither BHA nor AHA exhibited signs of resorption until 12 weeks of obliteration. However, the accelerated osteoconductive bone formation in the BHA group was better than in the AHA group according to micro-CT and confocal microscopic findings.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433033","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.57951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.47016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.335686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Alizarin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alizarin"},{"name":"Oxytetracycline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytetracycline"},{"name":"Calcein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcein"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Semiconductor device fabrication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Butylated hydroxyanisole","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylated_hydroxyanisole"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Brand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"}]}
