{"id":21725,"title":"The efficacy of corneal debridement in the treatment of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis: a prospective randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of corneal debridement in the treatment of clinically diagnosed cases of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis.Prospective, double-masked randomized clinical trial.Patients with clinical features such as multifocal, coarse, raised, punctate, round to oval epithelial lesions in the cornea in slit-lamp examination with mild to moderate conjunctival congestion, suggestive of microsporidial superficial keratoconjunctivitis, were included in the prospective study. All patients were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 patients underwent debridement with the help of a sterile #15 blade on a Bard-Parker handle, whereas only conjunctival swabs were taken from Group 2 patients. All patients were treated with ocular lubricants.One hundred and twenty patients with clinical features suggestive of microsporidial superficial keratoconjunctivitis were included in the study. The mean age was 34.3 ± 13.6 years (Group 1) and 35.8 ± 16.2 years (Group 2) (P = .59). The mean duration of symptoms was 6.8 ± 3.9 days (Group 1) and 7.2 ± 4.6 days (Group 2) (P = .61). Baseline characteristics showed no difference between the 2 groups. The primary outcome was the time from the presentation to complete resolution (ie, absence of corneal lesions) of the clinical signs and symptoms. The secondary outcomes were final visual acuity and residual corneal side effects and/or scarring, if any. The mean resolution time of the corneal lesions was 5.7 ± 4.0 days (Group 1) and 5.9 ± 3.9 days (Group 2) (P = .83). There was no significant difference in final visual outcome in the 2 groups. No serious side effects were observed.Debridement does not have any significant advantage in terms of resolution of the corneal lesions and final visual outcome in cases of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589573","annotations":[{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.843373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.785026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.760642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.734816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.666593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.646741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.38175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.36878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lubricant","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubricant"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Oval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
