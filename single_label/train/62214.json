{"id":62214,"title":"Qualifying high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing.","abstract":"Diversity of B and T cell receptors, achieved by gene recombination and somatic hypermutation, allows the immune system for recognition and targeted reaction against various threats. Next-generation sequencing for assessment of a cell's gene composition and variation makes deep analysis of one individual's immune spectrum feasible. An easy to apply but detailed analysis and visualization strategy is necessary to process all sequences generated. We performed sequencing utilizing the 454 system for CLL and control samples, utilized the IMGT database and applied the presented analysis tools. With the applied protocol, malignant clones are found and characterized, mutational status compared to germline identity is elaborated in detail showing that the CLL mutation status is not as monoclonal as generally thought. On the other hand, this strategy is not solely applicable to the 454 sequencing system but can easily be transferred to any other next-generation sequencing platform.
