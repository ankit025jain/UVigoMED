{"id":20459,"title":"Crystal structure and biochemical studies of Brucella melitensis 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase.","abstract":"The prokaryotic 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN) catalyzes the irreversible cleavage of the glycosidic bond in 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a process that plays a key role in several metabolic pathways. Its absence in all mammalian species has implicated this enzyme as a promising target for antimicrobial drug design. Here, we report the crystal structure of BmMTAN in complex with its product adenine at a resolution of 2.6 Ã… determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. 11 key residues were mutated for kinetic characterization. Mutations of Tyr134 and Met144 resulted in the largest overall increase in Km, whereas mutagenesis of residues Glu18, Glu145 and Asp168 completely abolished activity. Glu145 and Asp168 were identified as active site residues essential for catalysis. The catalytic mechanism and implications of this structure for broad-based antibiotic design are discussed.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657441","annotations":[{"name":"Glycosidic bond","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosidic_bond"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Prokaryote","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Crystal structure","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Adenine","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Drug design","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Active site","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_site"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.734591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.651102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.541382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.53822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.535822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.500538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.397972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Michaelis-Menten kinetics","weight":0.185302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis-Menten_kinetics"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Irreversible process","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Brucella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Dispersion (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
