{"id":86334,"title":"MicroRNA-26a involved in Toll-like receptor 9?mediated lung cancer growth and migration.","abstract":"Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) has been shown to have a significant role in cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs that fine tune translation of multiple target mRNAs, are involved in the development and progression of human cancers. The present study was undertaken to determine the roles of TLR9 on lung cancer and whether miR-26a is involved in TLR9?mediated lung cancer growth and migration. The lung cancer models were elicited by injecting human lung cancer cells into the left ventricle. The expression of TLR9 and miR-26a in lung cancer tissues obtained from lung cancer patients was increased. TLR9 ligand CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) caused an increase in the mean tumor weight and the size of tumor mass in nude mice, and the proliferation and migration of H460 human lung cancer cells. CpG-ODN also induced an increase in the expression of miR-26a in H460 cells. The overexpression of miR-26a increased the weight and size of the tumor mass in the nude mice, and the proliferation and migration of H460 cells. Expression of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) was increased after miR-26a overexpression in the H460 cells. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (WM) or Akt inhibitor triciribine hydrate (TCN) eliminated the increase in the proliferation and migration induced by the overexpression of miR-26a in H460 cells. These results suggested that miR-26a is involved in the TLR9?mediated growth and migration of lung cancer through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract
