{"id":44042,"title":"Review article: 2014 UK consensus guidelines - hepatitis C management and direct-acting anti-viral therapy.","abstract":"Therapeutic options for the management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have evolved rapidly over the past two decades, with a consequent improvement in cure rates. Novel therapeutic agents are an area of great interest in the research community, with a number of these agents showing promise in the clinical setting.To assess and present the available evidence for the use of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of HCV, updating previous guidelines.All Phase 2 and 3 studies, as well as abstract presentations from international Hepatology meetings were identified and reviewed for suitable inclusion, based on studies of new therapies in HCV. Treatment-na√Øve and experienced individuals, as well as cirrhotic and co-infected individuals were included.Sofosbuvir, simeprevir and faldaprevir, along with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, have a role in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The precise regimens are largely dependent on the patient characteristics, patient and physician preferences, and cost implication.Therapies for chronic HCV have evolved dramatically in recent years. Interferon-free regimens are now possible without compromise in the rate of sustained viral response. The decision as to which regimen is most appropriate is multifactorial, and based on efficacy, safety and cost.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754233","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.8314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.701946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.621806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.278737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Hepatology","weight":0.225451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatology"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Scientific community","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Adaptive radiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.016711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Abstract art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
