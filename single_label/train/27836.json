{"id":27836,"title":"Interim evaluation of a university-community collaboration to address methamphetamine use in a rural Missouri community.","abstract":"Methamphetamine use remains a significant public health problem. A multifaceted problem requires a collaborative effort.Community partners and university faculty collaborated to address meth use in a rural Missouri county. The objectives for this collaboration were to a) support current community partnerships by working with parents and teachers to incorporate a sustainable drug education curriculum in an elementary school and b) provide learning opportunities for senior nursing students.Various strategies were used in the collaboration, including focus groups with school personnel and piloting the curriculum in a local school.Community members and university faculty worked together in all stages of the collaboration. The collaboration allowed the community to continue and expand its efforts in reducing methamphetamine use. Community and university team members are working together to expand the implementation in additional grades.A real-world community problem can be addressed through a university-community collaboration.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152102","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"University","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Elementary school","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"School","weight":0.694294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.668416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.551766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Missouri","weight":0.0580456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Twelfth grade","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_grade"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Municipal corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"}]}
