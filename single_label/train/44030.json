{"id":44030,"title":"Lactobacillus salivarius Ren prevent the early colorectal carcinogenesis in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren (LS) on modulating colonic micro flora structure and influencing host colonic health in a rat model with colorectal precancerous lesions.Male F344 rats were injected with 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and treated with LS of two doses (5 × 10(8) and 1 × 10(10) CFU kg(-1) body weight) for 15 weeks. The colonic microflora profiles, luminal metabolites, epithelial proliferation and precancerous lesions [aberrant crypt foci (ACF)] were determined. A distinct segregation of colonic microflora structures was observed in LS-treated group. The abundance of one Prevotella-related strain was increased, and the abundance of one Bacillus-related strain was decreased by LS treatment. These changes were accompanied by increased short-chain fatty acid levels and decreased azoreductase activity. LS treatment also reduced the number of ACF by c. 40% and suppressed epithelial proliferation.Lactobacillus salivarius Ren improved the colonic microflora structures and the luminal metabolisms in addition preventing the early colorectal carcinogenesis in DMH-induced rat model.Colonic microflora is an important factor in colorectal carcinogenesis. Modulating the structural shifts of microflora may provide a novel option for preventing colorectal carcinogenesis. This study suggested a potential probiotic-based approach to modulate the intestinal microflora in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754742","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.6301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.512882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.270331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0711915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Acids in wine","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acids_in_wine"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"}]}
