{"id":26724,"title":"A novel, catheter-based approach to left ventricular assist device deactivation after myocardial recovery.","abstract":"We describe a case of catheter-based embolization and deactivation of a left ventricular assist device using an Amplatzer plug for a patient demonstrating myocardial recovery after diagnosis of nonischemic cardiomyopathy. This procedure can provide a minimally invasive, low morbidity solution for patients wishing to be separated from left ventricular assist device support who want to avoid invasive surgery for device removal.
