{"id":87081,"title":"Human cytomegalovirus upregulates expression of the lectin galectin 9 via induction of beta interferon.","abstract":"Regulation of the lectin galectin 9 (Gal-9) was investigated for the first time during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Gal-9 transcription was significantly upregulated in transplant recipients with reactivated HCMV in vivo. In vitro, Gal-9 was potently upregulated by HCMV independently of viral gene expression, with interferon beta (IFN-?) identified as the mediator of this effect. This study defines an immunoregulatory protein potently increased by HCMV infection and a novel mechanism to control Gal-9 through IFN-? induction.
