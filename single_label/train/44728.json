{"id":44728,"title":"ALPPS procedure: our experience and state of the art.","abstract":"The majority of the time extended liver resections cannot be realized because of an insufficient future remnant liver. Baumgart suggests recently combining liver partition and portal vein section for staged hepatectomy, named ALPPS procedure. Our aim is to share our initial experience with ALPPS procedure and to perform the first comprehensive English literature review.From January 2011 until June 2013, 6 patients underwent ALPPS, performing 6 extended right hepatectomies (one with concomitant right colectomy, one with main biliary duct resection).The present series showed a mean of 110% volume hypertrophy of the future remnant liver achieved with a mean of 15.3 days after ALPPS. One patient experienced severe liver failure, one had biliary leak and one died for postoperative respiratory distress syndrome. After a mean followup of 16.2 months (range 2-30 months) one patient had liver recurrence. In an English literature search, we identified 18 publications describing a mean hypertrophy rate of 85%, a mean morbidity and mortality rate of 35% and 6%, respectively.ALPPS is an effective technique used to induce an increased and rapid growth of the future remnant liver, but at the price of a higher morbidity and mortality compared with other conventional procedures.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719949","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.603042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.549784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.534879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.464931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.291534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.228691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.215185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.201146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.198373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"English literature","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_literature"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"State of the art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art"},{"name":"States of Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Brazil"},{"name":"Partition of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"}]}
