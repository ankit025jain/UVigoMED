{"id":36861,"title":"Clinical, dermoscopic and histopathological features of melanocytic nevi in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.","abstract":"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) nevi are acquired pigmented melanocytic lesions which may have clinical and dermoscopic features quite similar to those found in melanoma. More detailed information on this phenomenon is still lacking.To evaluate clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological features of melanocytic lesions in 13 patients with dystrophic EB (DEB).Patients underwent clinical and dermoscopic evaluation. Suspicious lesions were excised and examined microscopically.There were 12 cases of recessive DEB and one of dominant DEB. Five patients were men; 8 were women; the ages ranged from 2 to 27 years old. All patients had at least 2 atypical melanocytic lesions. Two of the 5 biopsied patients showed an atypical nevus or lentigo on histopathological examination.We observed a high incidence of large and atypical melanocytic lesions in DEB patients. Although the exact explanation for this is still unclear, it seems that re-epithelization and the chronic inflammatory process may stimulate the proliferation of melanocytes, as well as the emergence of lesions with atypical clinical and dermoscopic features. As an unequivocal discrimination from malignant melanoma in vivo is not always possible, regular clinical follow-up and histopathological evaluation of suspicious lesions in EB patients are mandatory.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533826","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Nevus","weight":0.679028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus"},{"name":"Melanocytic nevus","weight":0.600994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocytic_nevus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.554352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.55071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.520652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.323496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Lentigo","weight":0.0463236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentigo"},{"name":"Epidermolysis bullosa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermolysis_bullosa"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermolysis_bullosa_dystrophica"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
