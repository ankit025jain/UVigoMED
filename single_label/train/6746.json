{"id":6746,"title":"Neutralization of chemokine-like factor 1, a novel C-C chemokine, protects against focal cerebral ischemia by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration via MAPK pathways in rats.","abstract":"Inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Some proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, are produced in stroke. Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1), as a novel C-C chemokine, displays chemotactic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes and plays an important role in brain development. In previous studies, we have found that the expression of CKLF1 increased in rats after focal cerebral ischemia and treatment with the CKLF1 antagonist C19 peptide decreased the infarct size and water content. However, the role of CKLF1 in stroke is still unclear. The objective of the present study was to ascertain the possible roles and mechanism of CKLF1 in ischemic brain injury by applying anti-CKLF1 antibody.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to one-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion. Antibody to CKLF1 was applied to the right cerebral ventricle immediately after reperfusion; infarct volume and neurological score were measured at 24 and 72 hours after cerebral ischemia. RT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA were utilized to characterize the expression of adhesion molecules, inflammatory factors and MAPK signal pathways. Immunohistochemical staining and myeloperoxidase activity was used to determine the extent of neutrophil infiltration.Treatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody significantly decreased neurological score and infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner at 24 and 72 hours after cerebral ischemia. Administration with anti-CKLF1 antibody lowered the level of inflammatory factors TNF-?, IL-1?, MIP-2 and IL-8, the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The results of immunohistochemical staining and detection of MPO activity indicated that anti-CKLF1 antibody inhibited neutrophil infiltration. Further studies suggested MAPK pathways associated with neutrophil infiltration in cerebral ischemia.Selective inhibition of CKLF1 activity significantly protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing production of inflammatory mediators and expression of adhesion molecules, thereby reducing neutrophils recruitment to the ischemic area, possibly via inhibiting MAPK pathways. Therefore, CKLF1 may be a novel target for the treatment of stroke.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Animal
