{"id":89546,"title":"[Talocalcaneonavicular dislocation without associated fractures].","abstract":"Talocalcaneonavicular or subtalar dislocation is the simultaneous dislocation of the talar joints at the talocalcaneal and talonavicular levels. It may occur in any direction and results in foot deformity. The most common type is medial dislocation. Lateral, anterior and posterior dislocations are less common. These dislocations are associated with osteochondral fractures. Closed reduction and immobilization continue to be the cornerstones of treatment. X-rays and computerized axial tomography scan of the involved ankle and foot confirm the congruence of the subtalar joint after reduction and rule out fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging is a good alternative to assess talar vascular necrosis during the followup of these patients. The case of a medial subtalar dislocation in a 52 year-old patient is reported herein together with its diagnostic and therapeutic management and a case review from the medical literature.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707608","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.737922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.534078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.334618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.175313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.167416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0788712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Talus bone","weight":0.0499999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone"},{"name":"Osteochondrosis","weight":0.0496898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrosis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Subtalar joint","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtalar_joint"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
