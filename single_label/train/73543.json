{"id":73543,"title":"Fibroadenoma in an ectopic vulvar breast gland: a common neoplasm in an uncommon site.","abstract":"Ectopic breast tissue is defined as glands located outside of the breast. It can be found anywhere along the milk line extending from the axilla to the groin, and can occur in the vulva. Ectopic breast tissue should be excised because it may develop benign or malignant pathologic processes. Less than 40 cases of fibroadenoma in the vulva have been reported in the literature. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman presenting a solitary vulvar mass. The mass was excised completely, and histology demonstrated an ectopic breast fibroadenoma. This is one of the few reports on the benign pathologies of vulvar mammary glands.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897780","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroadenoma","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroadenoma"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Vulva","weight":0.812312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.716491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.454352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Milk line","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_line"},{"name":"Vulvar cancer","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvar_cancer"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Process (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
