{"id":89424,"title":"Venous thromboembolism and postoperative management of anticoagulation.","abstract":"Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are common after fragility fracture surgery, although the incidence is decreasing over time. Prophylaxis is important, because it is effective; additionally, the consequences are significant. Several medications are available for prophylaxis, and the choice of agent should be determined based on patient and surgery characteristics, and balancing of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding risk. A comprehensive approach to VTE prophylaxis includes consideration of a pharmacologic agent and nonpharmacologic management.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721368","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.876028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.845393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.774143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.607387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"}]}
