{"id":91771,"title":"Intracarpal tunnel contents: evaluation of the effects of corticosteroid injection with sonoelastography.","abstract":"To define the stiffness of the intracarpal tunnel contents and to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid injection on the intracarpal tunnel contents by using sonoelastography.This study was conducted with the approval of the institutional review boards, and all participants provided written, informed consent. Both hands were studied in 20 healthy volunteers, including eight men (mean age, 59.6 years; range, 50-76 years) and 12 women (mean age, 61.0 years; range, 39-79 years) and 22 hands were studied in 20 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (five men [mean age, 49.0 years] and 15 women [mean age, 61.1 years]; range, 39-89 years) between April 2012 and August 2012. The stiffness of the intracarpal tunnel contents was estimated as the standardized acoustic coupler (AC)-to-intracarpal tunnel contents surrounding the nerve (AC/C) strain ratio, analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. The patients were treated with corticosteroid injections, and the strain ratio was reexamined 6 weeks later, analyzed with the Wilcoxon t test.The mean AC/C strain ratio in the CTS patients was 12.6 ± 4.7 (standard deviation), which was higher (stiffer) than that in the healthy volunteers with a mean strain ratio of 8.2 ± 3.5 (P = .0013). Six weeks after the injection, the mean AC/C strain ratio had decreased to 8.5 ± 4.1 (P = .00069, compared with the preinjection value) in the CTS patients.The stiffness of the intracarpal tunnel contents in untreated CTS patients is higher than that of healthy volunteers but decreases 6 weeks after corticosteroid injection.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475831","annotations":[{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.687585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.276701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.273049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.13988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acoustic coupler","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Coupling (railway)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(railway)"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"},{"name":"3979 Brorsen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3979_Brorsen"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Atlantic Coast Conference","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference"}]}
