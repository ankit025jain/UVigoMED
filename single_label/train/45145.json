{"id":45145,"title":"Role of intracellular calcium and NADPH oxidase NOX5-S in acid-induced DNA damage in Barrett's cells and Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma cells.","abstract":"Mechanisms whereby acid reflux may accelerate the progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) are not fully understood. Acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to cause DNA damage in Barrett's cells. We have previously shown that NADPH oxidase NOX5-S is responsible for acid-induced H2O2 production in Barrett's cells and in EA cells. In this study we examined the role of intracellular calcium and NADPH oxidase NOX5-S in acid-induced DNA damage in a Barrett's EA cell line FLO and a Barrett's cell line CP-A. We found that pulsed acid treatment significantly increased tail moment in FLO and CP-A cells and histone H2AX phosphorylation in FLO cells. In addition, acid treatment significantly increased intracellular Ca(2+) in FLO cells, an increase that is blocked by Ca(2+)-free medium with EGTA and thapsigargin. Acid-induced increase in tail moment was significantly decreased by NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium in FLO cells, and by blockade of intracellular Ca(2+) increase or knockdown of NOX5-S with NOX5 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in FLO and CP-A cells. Acid-induced increase in histone H2AX phosphorylation was significantly decreased by NOX5 siRNA in FLO cells. Conversely, overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased tail moment and histone H2AX phosphorylation in FLO cells. We conclude that pulsed acid treatment causes DNA damage via increase of intracellular calcium and activation of NOX5-S. It is possible that in BE acid reflux increases intracellular calcium, activates NOX5-S, and increases ROS production, which causes DNA damage, thereby contributing to the progression from BE to EA.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699332","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.901657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.728037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.686347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"NADPH oxidase","weight":0.430315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.324133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.299254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.168492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Thapsigargin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thapsigargin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"British English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"}]}
