{"id":45370,"title":"Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position versus in the lateral position for patients with esophageal cancer: a comparison of short-term surgical results.","abstract":"Thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE) in the prone position for patients with esophageal cancer has received a great deal of attention. We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes and surgical stress of TE in the prone position (TE-P) and in the lateral position (TE-L) at our institution.A total of 58 consecutive patients (28 in the TE-L group and 30 in the TE-P group) were studied. Between the 2 groups, clinical outcomes and various parameters were compared.There were no hospital deaths in both TEL and TEP groups. Blood loss during the thoracoscopic part of the surgery were significantly (P<0.01) lower in the TE-P group (118±72 mL) compared with the TE-L (245±203 mL) group. The incidence of respiratory complications tended to be lower (P=0.07) in the TE-P group (3.3%) than in the TE-L (17.8%) group. The duration of systemic inflammatory response syndrome condition was significantly (P=0.02) shorter in the TE-P group (1.5±2.5 d) than in TE-L (3.6±3.5 d) group. The levels of serum C-reactive protein on postoperative days 1 and 2 were significantly (P<0.01) lower in the TE-P group than in the TE-L group.TE-P for patients with esophageal cancer was safe and feasible. TE-P might be a potentially less invasive procedure than TE-L.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686352","annotations":[{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.900351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.788855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.65588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.50729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.274482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.252303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.147104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Prone position","weight":0.0169634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_position"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"}]}
