{"id":88159,"title":"A 5-8 year retrospective follow-up of the C-stem AMT femoral component: patient reported outcomes and survivorship analysis.","abstract":"We report midterm functional, radiographic and survivorship data for the cemented, triple taper C-stem AMT femoral component from a consecutive cohort of 415 hip arthroplasties in 386 patients at a non-developer centre. Follow-up ranges were from 60 to 99 months, with a mean of 76 months. 32 hips were lost to follow-up. The median OHS was 40, median SF-12 mental component score (MCS) was 50, and median SF-12 physical component score (PCS) was 39. At 99 months follow up, stem survivorship is 96.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 82.5-99.5), and construct survivorship is 96.0% (95% CI 84.2-99.0). Adverse events such as calcar fracture, greater trochanter fracture and dislocation were rare at <1%. There have been no revisions for aseptic loosening.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891001","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Greater trochanter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_trochanter"},{"name":"Patient-reported outcome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-reported_outcome"},{"name":"Calcar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcar"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Concurrent estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate"},{"name":"Aluminum Model Toys","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_Model_Toys"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"}]}
