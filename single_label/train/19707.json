{"id":19707,"title":"Vacuum assisted closure therapy in the management of cervico-facial necrotizing fasciitis: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare polymicrobial, infection, characterized by a rapid and destructive spread within the subcutaneous tissue and along the superficial fascial planes, initially not affecting underlying muscles but with a common systemic involvement. Necrotizing fasciitis confined to the cervico-facial region is extremely rare (10% of cases) and is characterized by a high mortality rate due to airway compromise and to involvement of the supra-aortic vessels. The prognosis for survival is based on the severity of the necrotizing fasciitis, on the patient's systemic condition and on the prompt diagnosis and adequate surgical and medical management. We discuss a case of cervico-facial necrotizing fasciitis in a 25-year-old patient beginning with an odontogenic abscess, resistant to antibiotic therapy, rapidly progressing into an important right-sided swelling of the neck with worsening dyspnea and dysphagia. Because of his worsened general condition, the patient was transferred to the operating room for an emergency treatment. Under general anesthesia, the right cervical and left buccal purulent material was drained via right lateral cervicotomy an aggressive debridement of necrotic tissue, a disruption and excision of the all-necrotic fascia and a removal of the right submandibular gland. Thus, a portable mini-VAC device was applied. The early intervention with a specific diagnostic and therapeutic protocol and the wound treatment by means of vacuum assisted closure therapy allowed to obtain a quick healing, preventing the systemic involvement, minimizing morpho-esthetic outcome and limiting the costs of post-operative wound care.
