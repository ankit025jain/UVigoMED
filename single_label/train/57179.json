{"id":57179,"title":"[Effect of compound ezhu powder on serum levels of CA125 and CA19-9, and the expression of cyclin D protein in endometriosis patients].","abstract":"To study the effect of Compound Ezhu Powder (CEP) on serum levels of CA125 and CA19-9, and the expression of cyclin D protein in endometriosis patients, thus providing theoretical evidence for clinical application of CEP.Totally 69 all endometriosis patients underwent surgical treatment at Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tianjin Nankai Hospital from January 2011 to January 2013 were randomly assigned to group A (35 cases) and group B (34 cases). Meanwhile, 30 patients with uterine fibroids who prepared for surgical treatment during the same period were recruited as the control group. Patients in group A took EZP 3 months before surgery. No treatment was given to patients in group B and the control group. The serum CA125 level and the expression of cyclin D in the ectopic endometrium and the eutopic endometrium were detected in the 3 groups before surgery.The expression of cyclin D was higher in group A and group B than in the control group (P < 0.05). The serum levels of CA125 and CA19-9 were significantly lower in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). The expression of cyclin D in the ectopic endometrium was lower in group A than in group B, but with no statistical difference (P > 0.05). The expression of cyclin D in the eutopic endometrium was significantly lower in group A than in group B with statistical difference (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the serum CA125 level was positively correlated with the serum CA19-9 level (r = 0.45, P < 0.05).The expression of cyclin D obviously increased in endometriosis patients, which was associated with the occurrence of endometriosis. CEP could lower serum levels of CA125 and CA19-9, and down-regulate the expression level of cyclin D, indicating its roles in inhibiting the cell cycle.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223174","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.731062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.625628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.550484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.507291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.467133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.245077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Utopia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}]}
