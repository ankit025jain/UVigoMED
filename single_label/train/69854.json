{"id":69854,"title":"Resveratrol augments paclitaxel treatment in MDA-MB-231 and paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.","abstract":"Resveratrol (RES) inhibits cell growth, induces apoptosis and augments chemotherapeutics in multiple cancer types, although its effects on drug-resistant cancer cells are unknown.To study the effects of resveratrol in triple-negative breast cancer cells that are resistant to the common cancer drug, paclitaxel, a novel paclitaxel-resistant cell line was generated from the MDA-MB-231 cell line.The resistant MDA-MB-231/PacR cells exhibited a 12-fold increased resistance to paclitaxel. RES treatment reduced cell proliferation and colony formation and increased senescence and apoptosis in both parental and resistant cells. Importantly, RES augmented the effects of paclitaxel in both cell lines. Up-regulation of the MDR1 and CYP2C8 genes were shown to be potential mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance in the resistant cells.RES, both alone and in combination with paclitaxel, may be useful in the treatment of paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275030","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.437193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.39216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.390125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.24672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.196653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
