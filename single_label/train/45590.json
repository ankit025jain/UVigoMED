{"id":45590,"title":"Hypoxia among patients on the liver-transplant waiting list.","abstract":"Hepatopulmonary syndrome is formed by a triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation and changes in blood gases. This condition is present in 4-32% of patients with cirrhosis.To analyze the blood gas changes data of patients in liver-transplant waiting list.Clinical data of 279 patients in liver transplantation waiting list in May 2013 were studied. Overall patient was analyzed by the demographic aspects, laboratorial and image findings on exams that determine lung disease (hypoxemia) in these cirrhotic patients. The mean values and standard deviations were used to examine normally distributed variables.There was a high prevalence of male patients (68%); the mean age was 51(± 5,89) years, and the predominant reason for listing was hepatitis C cirrhosis. The MELD score mean was 16 ± 5,89, without prioritization or special situation. The most common blood type was O in 129 cases (46%) and the mean of body max index was 25,94 ± 4,58. Regarding arterial blood gas tests was observed 214 patients with PaO2 <90 mmHg, 80 with PaO2 <80 mmHg and 39 with PaO2 <50 mmHg. In relation to O2 saturation, 50 patients had <90%, 33 <80% and 10 <50%.Was observed a high rate of hypoxemia in patients on waiting list liver transplant. Due to the high severity and morbidity, is suggested better monitoring and therapeutic support to hypoxemic patients on liver transplant waiting list.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676301","annotations":[{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.746234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.723601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.517769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Hepatopulmonary syndrome","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatopulmonary_syndrome"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Arterial blood","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Secondary bronchus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_bronchus"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
