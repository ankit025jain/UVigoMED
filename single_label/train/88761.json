{"id":88761,"title":"[Type C2 proximal humeral fracture fixation using locking-plate with an intramedullary fibular allograft].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical results of locking-plate with an intramedullary fibular allograft for type C2 proximal humeral fracture fixation.Between January 2011 and August 2012, 16 patients with proximal humeral fractures (AO type C2) were treated by locking-plate with an intramedullary fibular allograft. The clinical data were retrospectively analysed. There were 5 males and 11 females with an average age of 64 years (range, 55-70 years). The injury causes were falling injury in 12 cases, traffic accident injury in 3 cases, and sports injury in 1 case. The duration between injury and operation ranged from 2 to 6 days (mean, 4.5 days). The imaging data were used to judge the fracture healing, and to measure the neck-shaft angle and the height of humeral head; the disability of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, short-form 36 health survey scale (SF-36), and Neer score were used to evaluate the function of the shoulder after surgery.Primary healing of incision was obtained in all patients; no complication of vascular and nerve injury occurred. Sixteen cases were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 18 months). All fractures healed at 18-24 weeks (mean, 20 weeks). No complication occurred as follows: re-displacement, necrosis, rejection reaction, and loosening or extraction of screws. At last follow-up, the neck-shaft angle was 126.6-136.9 degrees (mean, 132.5 degrees), showing a little lost when compared with intraoperative angle (130.5-138.0 degrees, 134.0 degrees on average). At 12 months after surgery, the height loss of humeral head was 1.8-4.6 mm (mean, 2.0 mm); the passive anteflexion of the shoulder was 130-160 degrees (mean, 148 degrees); the active anteflexion was 120-145 degrees (mean, 136 degrees); the external rotation was 30-65 degrees (mean, 56 degrees); the internal rotation was 15-25 degrees (mean, 19 degrees). And the DASH score was 2-53 (mean, 12); the SF-36 score was 50-95 (mean, 89). According to Neer score for shoulder function, the results were excellent in 10 cases, good in 4 cases, fair in 1 case, and poor in 1 case, with an excellent and good rate of 87.5%.Locking-plate with an intramedullary fibular allograft for type C2 proximal humeral fracture fixation has satisfactory clinical results because of stable fixation, high clinical outcome scores, and low internal fixation failure.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and
