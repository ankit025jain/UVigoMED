{"id":14770,"title":"Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Arcobacter species isolated from poultry meat in Iran.","abstract":"1. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Arcobacter spp. isolated from different species of retail poultry meat in Iran. 2. From August 2012 to April 2013, a total of 540 raw poultry meat samples from chicken (n = 100), turkey (n = 100), quail (n = 100), partridge (n = 80), duck (n = 50), ostrich (n = 60) and geese (n = 50) were purchased from randomly selected retail outlets in Shahrekord, Isfahan, Sari and Rasht, Iran. 3. Using culture techniques, 71 of 540 poultry meat samples (13.1%) were positive for Arcobacter spp. The highest prevalence of Arcobacter spp. was found in chicken meat (28.0%), followed by quail (12.0%), duck (11.4%), turkey (11.0%), geese (8.0%), partridge (7.5%) and ostrich (3.3%) meat. The number of A. butzleri isolated from poultry meat samples (90.1%) was significantly higher than A. cryaerophilus (7.1%) and A. skirrowii (2.8%). Significantly more poultry meat samples were found to contain Arcobacter spp. by the PCR assay than by the culture method. 4. Susceptibilities of Arcobacter isolates were determined for 14 antimicrobial drugs using the disk diffusion method. All of the 71 Arcobacter isolates tested were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. Resistance to cephalothin and vancomycin (95.8%) was the most common finding, followed by resistance to methicillin, azithromycin and ampicillin. All Arcobacter isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracyclin and kanamycin. 5. The results of this study indicated the importance of poultry meat, especially chicken meat, as potential sources of Arcobacter spp. infection in people. Furthermore, the strains indicated resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404949","annotations":[{"name":"Streptomycin","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.92209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Tetracycline","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Azithromycin","weight":0.831158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.732614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ostrich","weight":0.684596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.651062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Kanamycin","weight":0.554263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanamycin"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.551982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.463821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Quail","weight":0.454088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.422351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.346629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Goose","weight":0.341017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.296859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Partridge","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partridge"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Isfahan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan"},{"name":"Rasht","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasht"},{"name":"Cefalotin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefalotin"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
