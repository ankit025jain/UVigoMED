{"id":79846,"title":"Cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: long-term follow up.","abstract":"Chagas disease is a major cause of cardiomyopathy and sudden death in our country. It has a high mortality when their patients develop New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV.The objective of this study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure with optimized pharmacological therapy, undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy.Between January 2004 and February 2009, 72 patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy in NYHA class III and IV underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy and were monitored to assess their clinical evolution. We used the t test or the Wilcoxon test to compare the same variable in two different times. A P value < 0.05 was established as statistically significant.The average clinical follow-up was 46.6 months (range 4-79 months). At the end of the evaluation, 87.4% of patients were in NYHA class I or II (P<0.001). There was response to therapy in 65.3% of patients (P<0.001), with an overall mortality of 34.7%.In patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy, we found the following statistically significant changes: improvement in NYHA class and increase of left ventricle ejection fraction, a decrease of the systolic final diameter and systolic final left ventricle volume and improvement of patient survival.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896160","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.680683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.642497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.541329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.52828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.526508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.254398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.199681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Cardiac resynchronization therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.0188318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
