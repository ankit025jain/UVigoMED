{"id":15724,"title":"Practice recommendations cite use of disinfection caps, implementation strategies to reduce CLABSIs.","abstract":"The use of disinfection caps is one strategy highlighted in updated guidelines that focus on reducing central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The recommendations, which are sponsored by the Arlington, VA-based Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and other infection control organizations, focus not just on specific strategies, but also how to implement the strategies. Infection control advocates are hopeful that the dramatic gains made in reducing the incidence of CLABSls in ICUs can be extended to other units of the hospital setting including the ED. Disinfection caps are recommended under the\"special approaches\" section of the guidelines, which offers recommendations for locations or populations that have unacceptably high CLABSI rates. However, some hospitals are adopting the approach throughout their facilities with impressive results. Infection preventionists at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, IL report that disinfection caps helped them reduce CLABSls by 68% in one year, saving the organization more than $1 million. The approach replaces a scrub-the-hub approach that was used previously, but left room for error, according to administrators. Guideline authors gave disinfection caps a level 1 ranking, indicating that there is high-quality evidence to support their effectiveness. However, the authors stopped short of calling for their use on a routine basis","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141498","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.398826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.338155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.149656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Maywood, Illinois","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maywood,_Illinois"},{"name":"Loyola University Medical Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_University_Medical_Center"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Advocacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Graph (data structure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Loyola University Chicago","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_University_Chicago"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Snooker world rankings","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker_world_rankings"},{"name":"University Medical Center of Southern Nevada","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Medical_Center_of_Southern_Nevada"},{"name":"Arlington County, Virginia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia"}]}
