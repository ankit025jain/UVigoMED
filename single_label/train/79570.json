{"id":79570,"title":"Tracking malaria parasites in the eradication era.","abstract":"As more endemic countries enter the elimination phase, the detection of sporadic malaria infections or outbreaks elicits many questions: (i) are the infections locally acquired or imported? (ii) If imported, where do they come from? (iii) Do outbreak strains have a single or multiple geographic origins? New molecular barcoding methods provide ways to analyze clinical malaria parasite samples and answer these and other crucial questions.
