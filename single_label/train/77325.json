{"id":77325,"title":"[Forecasting decrease in performance and health disorders under exposure to work intensity factors in accordance with work conditions class].","abstract":"Results of complex physiologic and ergonomic, clinical and functional studies helped to justify approaches to quantitative evaluation and assessment of posssible decrease in performance and health disorders in workers in accordance with work conditions class of mental work. Linear regression dependence was established between work intensity class and performance decrease. The linear regression equation obtained enables to calculate a percentage of performance decrease in various work intensity classes. Intensive direct correlation was revealed between work intensity value and a percentage of individuals with diagnosed occupationally induced diseases.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069271","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.450542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.359226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.259155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.245792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Forecasting","weight":0.15904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0788712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
