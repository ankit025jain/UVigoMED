{"id":79989,"title":"Evaluation of purified antigen fraction in the immunodiagnosis of cystic echinococcosis.","abstract":"Echinococcus granulosus antigen B fraction (AgB) was evaluated for its prognostic value in the serological follow-up of cystic echinococcosis (CE), compared to crude hydatid fluid (HF) as well as soluble somatic Echinococcus multilocularis antigen (Em). The sensitivity and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were compared examining 177 sera from patients with different clinical courses and outcome of CE and with other parasitic infections. AgB-ELISA in comparison to confirmed cystic echinococcosis has 96.4% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity, with 93.1% positive predictive value and 98.6% negative predictive value. The HF-ELISA was more sensitive than the AgB-ELISA, but its specificity was lower. Our results indicate that AgB-ELISA was more satisfactory for seroconfirmation of acute echinococcosis than HF-ELISA. Moreover, the AgB-ELISA has a potential key role in control measures implemented in patients undergoing surgery. In sera of patients more than 3 months after the treatment, no antibody response to antigen B was detected; however, with conventionally used HF-ELISA, they were still positive. The AgB is recommended for the confirmatory diagnosis. AgB-WB allocated low background with typical \"triplet\" bands at 8-12-16 kDa.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828349","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.78463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.720349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.691792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.558381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.518673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.444956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.357043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Echinococcus granulosus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus"},{"name":"Echinococcus multilocularis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_multilocularis"},{"name":"Presumptive and confirmatory tests","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumptive_and_confirmatory_tests"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"}]}
