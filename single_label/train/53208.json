{"id":53208,"title":"Glucal-conjugated sterols as novel vascular leakage blocker: structure-activity relationship focusing on the C17-side chain.","abstract":"A series of glucal-conjugated sterols as novel vascular leakage blocker were identified through design, synthesis and biologically evaluation. In addition, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the glucal-conjugated sterols focusing on the C17-side chain was also established. The sterol analogs linked with the rigid C17-side chain side chains exhibited potent cell survival activities. In particular, analog 21l, which possesses a cyclopentyl oxime moiety, was shown to have excellent pharmacological effects on retinal vascular leakage in a diabetic mouse model.
