{"id":89283,"title":"[Resuscitation for myocardial infarction and head injury: first the heart or first the head?].","abstract":"Loss of circulation in a patient results in collapse and therefore possible head injury. After percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including anticoagulation, comatose patients are sedated for mild therapeutic hypothermia. Recognised or unrecognised head trauma may have dramatic clinical consequences. A 42-year-old male with unrecognised head trauma died due to a massive intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) during the hypothermia phase after being treated with PCI. A 76-year-old female, on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, with recognised ICH which resulted in an adjusted PCI, died after five days due to a lethal re-bleed. In a 55-year-old male with neurological abnormalities after mild head trauma, the PCI was postponed for a (negative) head CT which might have increased cardiac muscle damage. Nowadays more patients reach hospital after being resuscitated for cardiac arrest and possible head trauma should be considered in all these patients. This could lead to adjustments being made in the treatment protocol.
