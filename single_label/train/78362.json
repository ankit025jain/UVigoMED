{"id":78362,"title":"Adaptation and validation of the Voice Handicap Index in Latvian.","abstract":"To establish psychometric indicators of the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) (Latvian version) and their relationship to the psychometric indicators of the original items.Parallel group design.The VHI was translated and adapted to Latvian. The translated version of the VHI (Lat-VHI) was completed by 54 patients with voice disorders and by 73 subjects without voice disorders forming the control group. A test-retest group included 54 subjects without voice problems, able to complete the questionnaire twice. The test-retest stability, internal consistency of items of the Lat-VHI, and content and convergent validity of the Latvian version of the VHI were analyzed.The interclass correlation coefficient ratio of all scales indicated statistically significant (P<0.001) test-retest reliability for the Lat-VHI. High internal consistency was observed among the Lat-VHI total scale (?=.96), functional (?=.92), physical (?=.86), and emotional scale (?=.91) in the patient group. The Pearson moment correlation coefficient indicates a high correlation among the Lat-VHI total scale and subscales (r>0.94), as well as a high correlation among subscales (r>0.81) in the patient group. Convergent validity of the Lat-VHI was determined by comparing the Lat-VHI results with the Voice Disorder Severity scale results. Statistically significant correlation (r=0.78, P<0.001) was discovered in the patient group.The Latvian version of the VHI is a psychometrically validated instrument whose indicators correspond to the psychometric indicators of the original sample.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
