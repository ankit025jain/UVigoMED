{"id":78542,"title":"[Speech perception with hearing aids in comparison to pure-tone hearing loss].","abstract":"Speech perception is the most important social task of the auditory system. Consequently, speech audiometry is essential to evaluate hearing aid benefit. The aim of the study was to describe the correlation between pure-tone hearing loss and speech perception. In particular, pure-tone audiogram, speech audiogram, and speech perception with hearing aids were compared.In a retrospective study, 102 hearing aid users with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss were included. Pure-tone loss (PTA) was correlated to monosyllabic perception at 65 dB with hearing aid and with maximum monosyllabic perception with headphones.Speech perception as a function of hearing loss can be represented by a sigmoid function. However, for higher degrees of hearing loss, substantial deviations are observed. Maximum monosyllabic perception with headphones is usually not achieved with hearing aids at standard speech levels of 65 dB.For larger groups, average pure-tone hearing loss and speech perception correlate significantly. However, prognosis for individuals is not possible. In particular for higher degrees of hearing loss substantial deviations could be observed. Speech performance with hearing aids cannot be predicted sufficiently from speech audiograms. Above the age of 80, speech perception is significantly worse.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633376","annotations":[{"name":"Audiogram","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Speech perception","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.808982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.682909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Headphones","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Syllable","weight":0.121805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"},{"name":"Sigmoid function","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function"},{"name":"Josh \"Puretone\" Abrahams","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_\"Puretone\"_Abrahams"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Parent-Teacher Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"}]}
