{"id":14731,"title":"Depressive-like behavior induced by tumor necrosis factor-? is abolished by agmatine administration.","abstract":"Agmatine, an endogenous cationic amine, has been shown to exert antidepressant-like effects. This study investigated the ability of agmatine administered orally to abolish the depressive-like behavior induced by the administration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-?) in mice. In control animals, agmatine (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST). Acute administration of TNF-? (0.001 fg/mouse, i.c.v.) increased immobility time in the TST, indicative of a depressive-like behavior, and agmatine (0.0001, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg) prevented this effect. Additionally, we examined the effects of the combined administration of sub-effective doses of agmatine with antidepressants, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) in mice exposed to either TNF-? or saline. In control mice, administration of a sub-effective dose of agmatine (0.0001 mg/kg) combined with sub-effective doses of either fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, p.o.), imipramine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.), bupropion (1 mg/kg, p.o.), MK-801 (0.001 mg/kg, p.o.) or 7-NI (25 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the TST. All these administrations prevented the increased immobility time induced by TNF-?. The effect of agmatine in the TNF-? model of depression appears to be associated, at least partially, with an activation of the monoaminergic systems and inhibition of NMDA receptors and nitric oxide synthesis, although converging signal transduction pathways that may underlie the effect of agmatine should be further investigated. This set of results indicates that agmatine may constitute a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of depression associated with inflammation.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406719","annotations":[{"name":"NMDA receptor antagonist","weight":0.940946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Fluoxetine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.886001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Bupropion","weight":0.850298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Monoamine neurotransmitter","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Imipramine","weight":0.594617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipramine"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.573515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.548264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.448417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.426647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.410182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.288879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
