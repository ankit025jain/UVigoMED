{"id":22929,"title":"Accounting for centre-effects in multicentre trials with a binary outcome - when, why, and how?","abstract":"It is often desirable to account for centre-effects in the analysis of multicentre randomised trials, however it is unclear which analysis methods are best in trials with a binary outcome.We compared the performance of four methods of analysis (fixed-effects models, random-effects models, generalised estimating equations (GEE), and Mantel-Haenszel) using a re-analysis of a previously reported randomised trial (MIST2) and a large simulation study.The re-analysis of MIST2 found that fixed-effects and Mantel-Haenszel led to many patients being dropped from the analysis due to over-stratification (up to 69% dropped for Mantel-Haenszel, and up to 33% dropped for fixed-effects). Conversely, random-effects and GEE included all patients in the analysis, however GEE did not reach convergence. Estimated treatment effects and p-values were highly variable across different analysis methods.The simulation study found that most methods of analysis performed well with a small number of centres. With a large number of centres, fixed-effects led to biased estimates and inflated type I error rates in many situations, and Mantel-Haenszel lost power compared to other analysis methods in some situations. Conversely, both random-effects and GEE gave nominal type I error rates and good power across all scenarios, and were usually as good as or better than either fixed-effects or Mantel-Haenszel. However, this was only true for GEEs with non-robust standard errors (SEs); using a robust 'sandwich' estimator led to inflated type I error rates across most scenarios.With a small number of centres, we recommend the use of fixed-effects, random-effects, or GEE with non-robust SEs. Random-effects and GEE with non-robust SEs should be used with a moderate or large number of centres.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512175","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.76735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.659065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Estimator","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.527869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Standard error (statistics)","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_(statistics)"},{"name":"Estimating equations","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimating_equations"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.352126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.261138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.207972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Statistical power","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"},{"name":"GEE (navigation)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEE_(navigation)"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Convergence of random variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables"},{"name":"Data type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hydroelectricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"MIST (MUD)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIST_(MUD)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Meteorological reanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_reanalysis"},{"name":"Sandwich","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich"},{"name":"Scenario analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_analysis"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
