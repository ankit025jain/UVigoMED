{"id":82389,"title":"Immunoexpression of angiogenesis and proliferation markers in patients treated with cyclosporin A.","abstract":"In the present immunohistochemical study, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide synthase 1 and 3, and Ki-67 in the gingival tissues of renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A was assessed. Gingival overgrowth (GO) frequently occurs in transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine and this gingival inflammation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of drug-induced GO.Twenty-eight human gingival biopsies were taken from healthy patients with chronic periodontitis (N.=14 control group), and from renal transplant recipients treated with cyclosporin A (N.=14 test group). The retrieved specimens were immunohistochemically processed and stained for vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide synthase 1 and 3, and Ki-67.The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide synthase 1 and 3, and Ki-67 were found to be significantly different among groups (P>0.001), with patients treated with cyclosporin A showing higher levels of all the analyzed markers compared to control group.In summary, the data from this pilot study suggests that the investigated factors have a role in the inflammation processes associated to immunosuppressive therapy. However, further studies with a larger sample population need to be conducted for an exhaustive knowledge of the mechanisms leading to GO.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632797","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.807845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.794488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.659069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.59143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.462237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.313525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.227966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
