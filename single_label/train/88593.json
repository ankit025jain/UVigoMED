{"id":88593,"title":"Adult blunt renal trauma: routine follow-up imaging is excessive.","abstract":"To determine the yield of follow-up imaging in patients sustaining renal trauma at our level-1 trauma center and hence, whether the 2013 European Association of Urology guidelines are clinically applicable.All patients who attended Cork University Hospital with a diagnosis of renal injury from 2000-2012 were identified. Review of all medical records and radiologic imaging was undertaken. Injuries were graded using the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Organ Injury Scale and were grouped as low-grade injuries (I, II, and III) or high-grade injuries (IV and V).One hundred and two patients (105 renal units) were identified with a median age of 23 years (interquartile range, 18-39 years). The mechanism of injury was blunt force in 98 of 102 cases (96%). Injuries were diagnosed at the time of admission using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging. Low-grade injuries accounted for 78 of 102 cases (77%); all were managed conservatively with a complication rate of 2 of 78 (3%). Twenty-four patients (23%) had high-grade injuries; 2 cases required nephrectomy, 22 of 24 (92%) were managed conservatively with a complication rate of 5 of 24 (21%). All patients with complications were symptomatic, prompting repeat imaging. Overall, 38 of 102 patients (37%) underwent at least 1 follow-up CT: 20 of 78 (25%) of low-grade injuries and 18 of 24 (75%) of high-grade injuries. Concurrent thoracoabdominal injuries mandated the need for repeat CT evaluation in 21 of 38 patients (55%). Thirty-one (30%) patients were reimaged by renal ultrasonography.Selective reimaging of renal injuries based on clinical and laboratory criteria would have detected all complications. The 2013 European Association of Urology guidelines on urologic trauma are clinically appropriate in a major tertiary-trauma unit.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24821469","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.790549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.718951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.585517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.40451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.353647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.329115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.17501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0517203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Organ (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
