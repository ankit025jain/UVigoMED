{"id":81914,"title":"An update on optical coherence tomography in dentistry.","abstract":"An update and overview of the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in dentistry is described. Specific aspects discussed include the evolution of the technology and the basic process of light beam interference used to obtain OCT images. In addition, aspects of the optical properties of dentine and enamel and the range of current diagnostic applications of OCT in dentistry are reviewed.The technique of optical coherence tomography is considered to be significant since the technology involved allows imaging using light to around 2-3 mm in teeth and can, for example, allow the extent and progression of carious lesions to be determined.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783887","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.872173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.526372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.215692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Light beam","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_beam"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0458912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
