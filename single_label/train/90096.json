{"id":90096,"title":"Flexor tendon injuries in athletes.","abstract":"Flexor tendon injuries are not common in most sporting venues; however, recognition of the pertinent anatomy, clinical findings, and the utility of diagnostic imaging will assist the clinician in a thorough evaluation of the athlete's hand. Open injuries demand immediate wound care and evaluation as to the integrity of the flexor apparatus; however, closed injuries often present with the challenges of timing: delayed injury presentation and pressures of intervention and return to play. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the pertinent anatomy of the flexor apparatus of the hand, to identify key aspects of the patient history, clinical evaluation, and diagnostic testing relevant to flexor function, and to discuss treatment options in the setting of injuries to the flexor tendons and flexor pulley system of the hand.
