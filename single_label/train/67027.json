{"id":67027,"title":"Serum Endocan correlated with stage of chronic kidney disease and deterioration in renal transplant recipients.","abstract":"Earlier detection and intervention for chronic renal allograft injury (CRAI) remain major challenges for transplantation physicians. Endocan plays a key role in the regulation of cell adhesion, inflammatory disorders, and tumor progression. We conducted this cross-sectional study of 97 renal transplant (RT) recipients with mean RT duration of 7.0 ± 5.7 years to determine whether Endocan could be a diagnostic and prognostic marker. The patients' mean age was 43.6 ± 13.2 years, and 55.7% (54/97) were male. Higher Endocan levels were found in more advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the Endocan ? 643.19 pg/mL group had higher creatinine (Cr; 1.2 ± 0.4 vs 1.6 ± 1.1 mg/dL; P = .029) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 67.8 ± 23.8 mL/min vs 54.4 ± 22.0; P = .006) than the Endocan <643.19 pg/mL group after 3 months of follow-up, respectively. Linear regression analysis found tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? correlated well with Endocan. To elucidate the response of endothelium activation, we stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with TNF-? in vitro, and found the levels of Endocan (P = .022) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 (P = .034) increased with time, but interleukin (IL)-10 decreased (P = .013). In summary, Endocan may reflect the degree of endothelial cell injury in renal allografts, and showed a trend of elevation in late-stage CKD. An in vitro study demonstrated TNF-?-activated HUVECs secreted high levels of Endocan and TGF-?1, which could lead to a better understanding of the role of endothelium in immune balance. In conclusion, Endocan may have potential as a useful long-term indicator of CRAI in RT recipients, but further study is needed to verify our findings.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Male
