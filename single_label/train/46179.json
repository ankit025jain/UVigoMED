{"id":46179,"title":"Management of human papillomavirus-related anal and colon cancer.","abstract":"The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV-related anal cancer has been increasing at an alarming rate. Human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients are at a particularly high risk, with prevalence increasing rapidly in this population as life expectancies have increased. Screening has been very effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HPV-related cervical cancer, which suggests its role in reducing the burden of HPV-related anal cancer as well. With appropriate screening, patient education and treatment, the incidence of HPV-related anal cancer may be greatly reduced.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643190","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.875066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Anal cancer","weight":0.80487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.339088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"}]}
