{"id":77992,"title":"Primary care for deaf people with mental health problems.","abstract":"There are approximately 10 million people in the UK who have some form of hearing loss, and the prevalence of mental health problems among deaf people appears to be significantly higher compared with the wider population. Deaf people find it harder to establish good relationships with health professionals and, sadly, many of the issues arise from discrimination and practical obstacles faced within the healthcare system. Some of these issues include a lack of awareness, funding, and prioritisation within the wider political and healthcare agenda. This article provides an overview of the background of hearing loss and mental ill health, policy and current access to mental health services for deaf people, what has changed and recommendations for the future.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820809","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.626731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.54985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.497399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.35983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0572894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Community mental health service","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_mental_health_service"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"}]}
