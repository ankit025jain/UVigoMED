{"id":83833,"title":"Caffeine intake in children in the United States and 10-y trends: 2001-2010.","abstract":"Because of the increasing concern of the potential adverse effects of caffeine intake in children, recent estimates of caffeine consumption in a representative sample of children are needed.We provide estimates of caffeine intake in children in absolute amounts (mg) and in relation to body weight (mg/kg) to examine the association of caffeine consumption with sociodemographic factors and describe trends in caffeine intake in children in the United States.We analyzed caffeine intake in 3280 children aged 2-19 y who participated in a 24-h dietary recall as part of the NHANES, which is a nationally representative survey of the US population with a cross-sectional design, in 2009-2010. Trends over time between 2001 and 2010 were examined in 2-19-y-old children (n = 18,530). Analyses were conducted for all children and repeated for caffeine consumers.In 2009-2010, 71% of US children consumed caffeine on a given day. Median caffeine intakes for 2-5-, 6-11-, and 12-19-y olds were 1.3, 4.5, and 13.6 mg, respectively, and 4.7, 9.1, and 40.6 mg, respectively, in caffeine consumers. Non-Hispanic black children had lower caffeine intake than that of non-Hispanic white counterparts. Caffeine intake correlated positively with age; this association was independent of body weight. On a given day, 10% of 12-19-y-olds exceeded the suggested maximum caffeine intake of 2.5 mg/kg by Health Canada. A significant linear trend of decline in caffeine intake (in mg or mg/kg) was noted overall for children aged 2-19 y during 2001-2010. Specifically, caffeine intake declined by 3.0 and 4.6 mg in 2-5- and 6-11-y-old caffeine consumers, respectively; no change was noted in 12-19-y-olds.A majority of US children including preschoolers consumed caffeine. Caffeine intake was highest in 12-19-y-olds and remained stable over the 10-y study period in this age group.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240076","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.727604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.645021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.412781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Caffeine","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.321447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.315821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.284157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Health Canada","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Canada"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.203234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1219"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"Absolute monarchy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"List of U.S. states and territories by population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Fad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Recall election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"}]}
