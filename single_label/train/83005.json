{"id":83005,"title":"In situ protocol for the determination of dose-response effect of low-fluoride dentifrices on enamel remineralization.","abstract":"No in situ protocol has assessed the dose-response effects of fluoride dentifrices involving low-fluoride formulations.To assess the ability of an in situ remineralization model in determining dose-response effects of dentifrices containing low fluoride concentrations ([F]) on bovine enamel.Volunteers wore palatal appliances containing demineralized enamel blocks and brushed their teeth and devices with the dentifrices supplied (double-blind, crossover protocol) separately for 3 and 7 days. Surface hardness (SH), integrated subsurface hardness (?KHN) and [F] in enamel were determined. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey's test and Pearson's correlation (p<0.05).Dose-response relationships were verified between [F] in dentifrices and SH, ?KHN and enamel [F]. Higher correlation coefficients between enamel [F] and SH and ?KHN were obtained for the 3-day period. Significant differences in SH and ?KHN were observed among all groups for the 3-day period, but not between 0-275, 275-550, and 550-1,100 µg F/g dentifrices for the 7-day period, nor between 3- and 7-day periods for the 1,100 µg F/g groups.Considering that the peak remineralization capacity of the conventional dentifrice (1,100 µg F/g) was achieved in 3 days, this experimental period could be used in future studies assessing new dentifrice formulations, especially at low-fluoride concentrations.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473718","annotations":[{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.510378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.234985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.151332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0810573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gunpowder","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder"},{"name":"Remineralisation of teeth","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0222665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Groundwater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater"},{"name":"Brushed metal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_metal"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Palatal consonant","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
