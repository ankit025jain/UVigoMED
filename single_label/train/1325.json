{"id":1325,"title":"Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm: case presentation and review.","abstract":"Descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, similar to other aneurysms, are often incidentally diagnosed in patients with unrelated complaints. Management of these aneurysms is largely dependent on their size and anatomy. Most individuals with asymptomatic descending thoracic aortic aneurysms may be safely managed with cardiovascular risk factor modification until the aneurysm size reaches 6 cm. A subset of individuals, such as those whose descending thoracic aortic aneurysm measures > 6 cm or in cases of rapid growth, should be offered repair, increasingly performed via an endovascular approach. The higher risk of aneurysm rupture in women poses a unique consideration, although to date no gender-specific consensus screening guideline exists for aneurysmal disease of the thoracic aorta.
