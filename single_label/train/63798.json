{"id":63798,"title":"Novel therapies for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: what does the future hold?","abstract":"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) represent a group of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas, of which mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most frequent. Standard therapeutic approaches are well established and often achieve stable disease. However, cure for MF is rare and thus novel therapies are needed.This review provides a discussion of the most promising new therapeutic approaches in the management of MF and other rare CTCLs. It includes targeted therapies with antibodies against surface molecules on malignant T cells (e.g., brentuximab), novel chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., pralatrexate), small-molecule compounds (e.g., panobinostat) and evidence of emerging targets in CTCLs (e.g., anti-IL-31). It also provides discussion of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1 that are worth considering in the treatment of leukaemic CTCL variants. Finally, it gives a brief overview of the possible use of stem-cell transplantation.There is no doubt that progress has been made in the treatment of CTCLs with new, innovative and promising therapies approaching. However, there is still an urgent need to identify and test additional targets in well-designed clinical trials.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397291","annotations":[{"name":"Mycosis fungoides","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis_fungoides"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Panobinostat","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panobinostat"},{"name":"Pralatrexate","weight":0.806612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pralatrexate"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.67656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.650142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.557946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.374227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Brentuximab vedotin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
