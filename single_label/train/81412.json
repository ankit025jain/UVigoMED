{"id":81412,"title":"Alternative approach to management of early loss of second primary molar: a clinical case report.","abstract":"Preservation of space after premature loss of the second primary molar is essential to prevent mesial drifting of the permanent first molar. Various modifications of distal shoe space maintainers, which have been documented, are all nonfunctional in nature. This paper describes an innovative design of a functional distal shoe space maintainer that is intended to overcome the disadvantages of conventional non-functional space maintainers and that does not hamper the periodontal status of the abutment tooth.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087351","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.231754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Shoe","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.110465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drifting (motorsport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)"},{"name":"Software maintainer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintainer"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Hamper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamper"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.0121598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"}]}
