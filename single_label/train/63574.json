{"id":63574,"title":"Papilledema as the initial presentation of Castleman disease.","abstract":"Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that has many presentations ranging from unifocal or multifocal mass lesions to a monoclonal gammopathy. It has features that may overlap with osteosclerotic myeloma or POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, skin changes) syndrome. We report a patient with papilledema, enlarged lymph nodes, and monoclonal IgG, who subsequently developed a polyneuropathy. Biopsy of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes confirmed the diagnosis of Castleman disease.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423600","annotations":[{"name":"Papilledema","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilledema"},{"name":"Castleman's disease","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleman's_disease"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.744544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Paraprotein","weight":0.506058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraprotein"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.46174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Osteosclerosis","weight":0.105579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosclerosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"}]}
