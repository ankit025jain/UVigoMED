{"id":12769,"title":"Henipavirus microsphere immuno-assays for detection of antibodies against Hendra virus.","abstract":"Hendra and Nipah viruses (HeV and NiV) are closely related zoonotic pathogens of the Paramyxoviridae family. Both viruses belong to the Henipavirus genus and cause fatal disease in animals and humans, though only HeV is endemic in Australia. In general and due to the acute nature of the disease, agent detection by PCR and virus isolation are the primary tools for diagnostic investigations. Assays for the detection of antibodies against HeV are fit more readily for the purpose of surveillance testing in disease epidemiology and to meet certification requirements in the international movement of horses. The first generation indirect ELISA has been affected by non-specific reactions which must be resolved using virus neutralisation serology conducted at laboratory bio-safety level 4 containment (PC4). Recent developments have enabled improvements in the available serology assays. The production of an expressed recombinant truncated HeV G protein has been utilised in ELISA and in Luminex-based multiplexed microsphere assays. In the latter format, two Luminex assays have been developed for use in henipavirus serology: a binding assay (designed for antibody detection and differentiation) and a blocking assay (designed as a surrogate for virus neutralisation). Equine and canine field sera were used to evaluate the two Luminex assays relative to ELISA and virus neutralisation serology. Results showed that Luminex assays can be effective as rapid, sensitive and specific tests for the detection of HeV antibody in horse and dog sera. The tests do not require PC4 containment and are appropriate for high throughput applications as might be required for disease investigations and other epidemiological surveillance. Also, the results show that the Luminex assays detect effectively HeV vaccine-induced antibodies.
