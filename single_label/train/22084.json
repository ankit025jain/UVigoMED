{"id":22084,"title":"Antifungal activity of phenolic compounds identified in flowers from North Eastern Portugal against Candida species.","abstract":"To evaluate the antifungal effect of gallic acid, catechin, luteolin and quercetin, phenolic compounds identified from flowers of North Eastern Portugal, against Candida planktonic and biofilm cells.The MICs were determined in Candida planktonic cells and the effect of phenolic compounds on Candida biofilms was assessed through quantification of colony-forming units.MIC values demonstrated that gallic acid presented the highest effect against all Candida species. Catechin showed a similar effect against Candida albicans American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 90028 cells. In addition, gallic acid and quercetin had demonstrated only a minimal effect against Candida species biofilms.Gallic acid affected the growth of the different planktonic Candida species in all concentrations used; still, catechin showed a similar effect against C. albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida glabrata ATCC 2001 cells. In addition, only gallic acid and quercetin demonstrated a slight effect against all Candida species biofilms.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571069","annotations":[{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Catechin","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.778993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Phenolic compounds in wine","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenolic_compounds_in_wine"},{"name":"Flower","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.656654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.609038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Luteolin","weight":0.540992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteolin"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.380204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Phenols","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenols"},{"name":"American Type Culture Collection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Culture_Collection"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Plankton","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Malaysian Indian Congress","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Indian_Congress"},{"name":"Gaul","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
