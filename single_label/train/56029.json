{"id":56029,"title":"Anterior chamber collapse syndrome in a koala.","abstract":"Anterior chamber collapse syndrome has been recognised in various species and is associated with early-life ocular disease or trauma. It is important to differentiate this acquired condition from a congenital malformation.An adult female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) was referred for assessment of buphthalmos and severe keratitis of the right eye. The degree of keratitis obstructed examination of intraocular structures. Enucleation of the affected eye was performed and the histopathological diagnosis was anterior chamber collapse syndrome and secondary glaucoma. This case contributes to the limited information available in the literature on anterior chamber collapse syndrome, a disease unique in having secondary glaucoma with minimal or no inflammation. The case also expands the literature available on ocular disease in koalas. More specifically, this is the only reported case of glaucoma, of any aetiology, in the koala.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766050","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.828271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.659069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.651338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.437904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Koala","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala"},{"name":"Buphthalmos","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buphthalmos"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
