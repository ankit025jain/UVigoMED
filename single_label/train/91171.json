{"id":91171,"title":"Age and sex differences in vascular responsiveness in healthy and trauma patients: contribution of estrogen receptor-mediated Rho kinase and PKC pathways.","abstract":"Several medical conditions exhibit age- and sex-based differences. Whether or not traumatic shock exhibits such differences with regard to vascular responsiveness is not clear. In a cohort of 177 healthy subjects and 842 trauma patients (21-82 years) as well as different ages (4, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 wk; 1 and 1.5 years) and sexes of Sprague-Dawley normal and traumatic shock rats, the age- and sex-based differences of vascular responsiveness and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Middle-aged and young women as well as female rats of reproductive age had higher vascular responsiveness in the normal condition and a lower decrease in vascular responsiveness after traumatic shock than older men and male rats of identical age. Exogenous supplementation of 17?-estrdiol increased vascular reactivity in both male and femal rats of 8-24 wk and preserved vascular responsiveness in rats following traumatic shock. No effect was observed in rats 1 to 1.5 years. These protective effects of estrogen were closely related to G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)30, estrogen receptor-mediated Rho kinase, and PKC pathway activation. Vascular responsiveness exhibits age- and sex-based differences in healthy subjects and trauma patients. Estrogen and its receptor (GPR30) mediated activation of Rho kinase and PKC using genomic and nongenomic mechanisms to elicit protective effects in vascular responsiveness. This finding is important for the personalized treatment for several age- and sex-related diseases involving estrogen.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531808","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.740368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.714127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.48229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.167916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Rho-associated protein kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho-associated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.0246002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Rho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"}]}
