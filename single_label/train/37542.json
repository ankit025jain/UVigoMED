{"id":37542,"title":"Second trimester ultrasound markers of fetal aneuploidy.","abstract":"Although it is widely accepted that the best time to screen for chromosomal abnormalities is the first trimester, ultrasound evaluation of the fetus in the second trimester has also been shown to be useful for this purpose. A multitude of markers of varying strength has been developed over the past 30 years. In addition, the optimal time to diagnose fetal anomalies with confidence is also the mid second trimester. Therefore, performance of obstetrical ultrasound at this point in gestation continues to be an important component of prenatal care.
