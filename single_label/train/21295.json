{"id":21295,"title":"Hematopoietic stem cells, infection, and the niche.","abstract":"The immune response to infection is a rapid and multifaceted process. Infection affects homeostasis within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, as lost immune cells must be replaced by HSCs. During the immune response, interferon is produced. Surprisingly, HSCs respond directly to interferon, entering the cell cycle from even the most dormant state. The complex response of both the HSCs and the niche to infection is a unique platform on which to consider HSC-niche interactions. Here, we comment on the contribution of the immune system to the niche and on the direct and indirect effect that infection has on HSCs in the niche.
