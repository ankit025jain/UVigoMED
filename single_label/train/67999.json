{"id":67999,"title":"Congenital giant male anterior urethral diverticulum with calculi.","abstract":"Urethral diverticulum is a sac-like outpouching of urethral mucosa. It may be anterior or posterior according to anatomical locations. It is less common in men than in women. It can be congenital or acquired. Anterior urethral diverticula are usually congenital as compared to majority of posterior diverticula which are acquired. The most common aetiologies of male acquired diverticula are stricture, abscess, trauma or post-hypospadias repair. We report a case of congenital giant anterior urethral diverticulum with a calculus which has been managed successfully with surgical excision and repair in two layers.
