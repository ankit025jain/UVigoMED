{"id":553,"title":"Impact of 3-D glucan during liver transplantation.","abstract":"?-D glucan in the portal vein blood is processed by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, and therefore, it is possible that the ?-D glucan kinetics of the peripheral vein blood may be useful as a biological index. In this study, the ?-D glucan levels in the peripheral and portal vein blood during liver transplantation were measured in order to study the clinical significance of the molecule.The subjects comprised 20 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation. In the perioperative period, the ?-D glucan levels were measured before liver transplantation, during surgical procedure, then on postoperative days 5, 14 and 21.The portal vein blood showed a significantly higher level of ?-D glucan than the peripheral blood (p<0.001). A significant difference of ?-D glucan levels was observed between the pre-liver transplantation and postoperative days 5 (p=0.048). There was a significant positive correlation between the preoperative ?-D glucan level and the period of postoperative hospitalization (p<0.001). The patients with fungal infections (35.0%) had a significantly longer period of hospitalization (p=0.019).The ?-D glucan kinetics accurately reflects the liver function and fungal infections. The ?-D glucan level before liver transplantation can be used to","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436313","annotations":[{"name":"Mononuclear phagocyte system","weight":0.861889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_phagocyte_system"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.732757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.333138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Living donor liver transplantation","weight":0.306292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_donor_liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme kinetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Glucan","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucan"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Peripheral vein","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vein"}]}
