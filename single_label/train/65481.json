{"id":65481,"title":"Postoperative assessment of vascular access.","abstract":"Vascular access problems lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality. Autologous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are preferred over grafts. An increase in utilization of AVFs results in an increased incidence of early AVF failure and nonmaturation. A thorough evaluation of a new AVF after 4-6 weeks after creation should be considered mandatory. Experienced persons can examine AVF and predict its utility as a dialysis access. Detailed physical examination of the access performed by educated and trained staff can provide, in most cases, adequate information about the main causes for AVF dysfunction in case of nonmaturation or in case of late access complications. Physical examination has been shown to be very accurate in assessing fistula and is not difficult to learn. Doppler ultrasound (DU) is an additional diagnostic method to predict the ultimate maturation of newly created AVFs and is also very useful in further defining problems that have been detected by physical examination. DU also provides additional information that is of the utmost importance for the surgical or interventional treatment.In this review, basic principles of physical examination and of DU examination of early and late AVF/graft complications are shown.
