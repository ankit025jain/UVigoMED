{"id":76403,"title":"Forging a pediatric primary care-community partnership to support food-insecure families.","abstract":"Academic primary care clinics often care for children from underserved populations affected by food insecurity. Clinical-community collaborations could help mitigate such risk. We sought to design, implement, refine, and evaluate Keeping Infants Nourished and Developing (KIND), a collaborative intervention focused on food-insecure families with infants.Pediatricians and community collaborators codeveloped processes to link food-insecure families with infants to supplementary infant formula, educational materials, and clinic and community resources. Intervention evaluation was done prospectively by using time-series analysis and descriptive statistics to characterize and enumerate those served by KIND during its first 2 years. Analyses assessed demographic, clinical, and social risk outcomes, including completion of preventive services and referral to social work or our medical-legal partnership. Comparisons were made between those receiving and not receiving KIND by using ?2 statistics.During the 2-year study period, 1042 families with infants received KIND. Recipients were more likely than nonrecipients to have completed a lead test and developmental screen (both P < .001), and they were more likely to have received a full set of well-infant visits by 14 months (42.0% vs. 28.7%; P < .0001). Those receiving KIND also were significantly more likely to have been referred to social work (29.2% vs. 17.6%; P < .0001) or the medical-legal partnership (14.8% vs. 5.7%; P < .0001). Weight-for-length at 9 months did not statistically differ between groups.A clinical-community collaborative enabled pediatric providers to address influential social determinants of health. This food insecurity-focused intervention was associated with improved preventive care outcomes for the infants served.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25049345","annotations":[{"name":"Social determinants of health","weight":0.856301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.640631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.628461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.558923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.555229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Food security","weight":0.510143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.222201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Infant formula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Formula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula"},{"name":"Enumeration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"}]}
