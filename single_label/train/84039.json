{"id":84039,"title":"Direct conversion of adult skin fibroblasts to endothelial cells by defined factors.","abstract":"Cell-based therapies to augment endothelial cells (ECs) hold great therapeutic promise. Here, we report a novel approach to generate functional ECs directly from adult fibroblasts.Eleven candidate genes that are key regulators of endothelial development were selected. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-negative skin fibroblasts were prepared from Tie2-GFP mice and infected with lentiviruses allowing simultaneous overexpression of all 11 factors. Tie2-GFP(+) cells (0.9%), representing Tie2 gene activation, were detected by flow cytometry. Serial stepwise screening revealed 5 key factors (Foxo1, Er71, Klf2, Tal1, and Lmo2) that were required for efficient reprogramming of skin fibroblasts into Tie2-GFP(+) cells (4%). This reprogramming strategy did not involve pluripotency induction because neither Oct4 nor Nanog was expressed after 5 key factor transduction. Tie2-GFP(+) cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and designated as induced ECs (iECs). iECs exhibited endothelium-like cobblestone morphology and expressed EC molecular markers. iECs possessed endothelial functions such as Bandeiraea simplicifolia-1 lectin binding, acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake, capillary formation on Matrigel, and nitric oxide production. The epigenetic profile of iECs was similar to that of authentic ECs because the promoters of VE-cadherin and Tie2 genes were demethylated. mRNA profiling showed clustering of iECs with authentic ECs and highly enriched endothelial genes in iECs. In a murine model of hind-limb ischemia, iEC implantation increased capillary density and enhanced limb perfusion, demonstrating the in vivo viability and functionality of iECs.We demonstrated the first direct conversion of adult fibroblasts to functional ECs. These results suggest a novel therapeutic modality for cell therapy in ischemic vascular disease.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
