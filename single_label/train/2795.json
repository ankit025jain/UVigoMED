{"id":2795,"title":"Multimodal imaging for the diagnosis of an atypical case of central serous chorioretinopathy.","abstract":"We report a case of a 52-year-old woman presented with atypical central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) that had been misdiagnosed as posterior uveitis and treated with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, with subsequent severe chorioretinal damage. Diagnosis was straightened through multimodal imaging. Anatomical improvement was achieved after discontinuation of corticosteroids and intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. However, visual acuity remained severely impaired in one eye. Failure to differentiate atypical CSCR from inflammatory chorioretinal diseases may lead to severe and irreversible visual impairment. Multimodal imaging helps recognition of the atypical presentations of CSCR, avoiding misdiagnosis and inappropriate management.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371645","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.727753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.652243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.636533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.519897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.150191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.129709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Hair straightening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_straightening"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
