{"id":56842,"title":"Current status of visual field examination in Andalusia, Spain: the SICVA Study.","abstract":"To ascertain the frequency of visual field examination (VFE) in patients attending public Andalusian hospitals (the SICVA study).This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective study of patients with documented and/or suspected glaucoma subject to campimetric monitoring for longer than 2 years. The numbers of VFEs performed in the first 2 years and in the complete follow-up period were analyzed. Data on VFE reliability were studied and VFE change was collected based on the Glaucoma Staging System 2.A total of 722 eyes (from 467 consecutive patients), 349 with suspected and 373 with documented glaucoma, were included. Mean patient age was 65.9 years (SD = 11.3), and median follow-up time was 56 months (P25 = 36, P75 = 84). Three (P25 = 2, P75 = 4) VFEs were performed in the first 2 years of follow-up in the overall sample, as compared to 2 VFEs (P25 = 2, P75 = 4) in patients with suspected glaucoma, and 3 VFEs (P25 = 2, P75 = 4) in those with documented glaucoma (p<0.001).Based on these results, frequency of VFE in Andalusia differs from the standards recommended by the European Glaucoma Society to assess progression in the first 2 years of patient follow-up.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619854","annotations":[{"name":"Spain","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Field work","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_work"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Al-Andalus","weight":0.0519649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Andalusia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acorn System 2","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_System_2"},{"name":"Project 25","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_25"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
