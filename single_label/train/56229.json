{"id":56229,"title":"Evaluation of an automated thermodynamic treatment (LipiFlow®) system for meibomian gland dysfunction: a prospective, randomized, observer-masked trial.","abstract":"To compare the effectiveness of a single LipiFlow(®) treatment with combined lid warming and massage in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).In this prospective, randomized, crossover, observer-masked clinical trial, subjects were randomized to receive either a single 12-min LipiFlow-LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation (LTP) system treatment or to perform combined twice-daily lid warming and massage for 3 months. All subjects were examined before, and 1 and 3 months after initiation of treatments. Investigated parameters included subjective symptoms, lipid layer thickness, meibomian gland assessment, tear break-up time, tear osmolarity, corneal and conjunctival staining, Schirmer test values, and tear meniscus height.A total of 31 subjects completed the 3-month follow-up. At 1 and 3 months, patients in the LipiFlow treatment group had a significant reduction in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores compared with those in the lid-margin hygiene group. Both treatments produced a significant improvement in expressible meibomian glands compared to the baseline parameters, but no significant difference was noted between the two groups. The other investigated objective parameters did not show a significant difference.Results of our study show that a single LipiFlow treatment is as least as effective as a 3-month, twice-daily lid margin hygiene regimen for MGD. However, the present study was observer-masked only, and therefore a placebo effect may have confounded any improvements in subjective symptoms and other parameters in both groups.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725326","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.837474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.820698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Placebo effect","weight":0.804459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo_effect"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.800924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.201662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.161966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.113361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Meniscus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus"},{"name":"Schirmer's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schirmer's_test"},{"name":"Meibomian gland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meibomian_gland"},{"name":"Osmolarity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmolarity"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0171701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"G.
