{"id":47639,"title":"[Comparative study on the clinical characteristics of HBV infection patients with different pathologic inflammation grade].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the biochemical and virological characteristics among patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) according to pathologic inflammation grade.428 patients with chronic HBV infection accept liver biopsy, liver function test, HBeAg detection and HBV DNA levels detection. They were studied and subdivided into four groups according to pathologic inflammation grade. The biochemical and virological characteristics were studied. Univariate analysis was performed with the SPSS 16.0.In different inflammation grading group, mean age and sex composition were no difference. Serum levels of ALT was highest in group G3 and lowet in group G0-1, there was statistically significant among groups (P = 0.005); AST and TBil were all highest in group G4 and lowest in group G0-1, statistically significant also found among groups (P = 0.000 & 0.004). Serum levels of ALB and PTA were all highest in group G0-1 and lowest in group G4, had statistically significant among groups (P = 0.000 & 0.000). There was no difference of HBV DNA level and percentage of HBeAg (+) among four groups (P = 0.565 & 0.065).The serum AST, TBil, ALB and PTA were different and can partly reflect the inflammation degree of liver damage in patients with HBV infection. ALT and PTA can reflect the inflammation degree of G0-1, G2 and G3; AST, TBil, ALB and PTA reflect the G3 and G4. HBV DNA level and HBeAg status can not indicate the inflammation degree in HBV infection patients.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579472","annotations":[{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.829799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.760849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.599933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.554434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.495769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"G4 (TV channel)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"428","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/428"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Minuscule 565","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_565"},{"name":"G1","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1"},{"name":"Parent-Teacher Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association"},{"name":"2006 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
