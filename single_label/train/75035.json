{"id":75035,"title":"Growth associated protein (GAP-43): cloning and the development of a sensitive ELISA for neurological disorders.","abstract":"GAP-43 has been studied in the rodent and mammalian brain and shown to be present specifically in areas undergoing axonal elongation and synapse formation. GAP-43 was cloned using the baculovirus expression system and purified. A sandwich ELISA was developed using the recombinant GAP-43 as standard and validated. CSF GAP-43 levels were analysed in benign intracranial hypertension, movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, CNS infections, motor neuron disease, and headache (neurological controls). GAP-43 levels were low in all disorders analysed (in particular motor neuron disease; p=0.001, and movement disorders and multiple sclerosis; p<0.0001) compared to controls, aside from CNS infections. GAP-43 is preferentially reduced in the CSF of neurological disorders associated with neurodegeneration.
