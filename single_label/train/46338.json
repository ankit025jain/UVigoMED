{"id":46338,"title":"Preferences for blood-based colon cancer screening differ by race/ethnicity.","abstract":"To examine attitudes of a diverse community-based sample toward SEPT9, a simple, cost-effective colorectal cancer (CRC) blood test.One-hundred participants eligible for CRC screening (Mage =58.3; 44% unscreened; 38% white, 31% Hispanic, 31% black) completed cross-sectional surveys of their screening preferences following group discussions of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, FOBT, and SEPT9.Overall, 91% ranked SEPT9 first or second. Controlling for sociodemographic factors, unscreened Whites strongly preferred SEPT9, listing multiple advantages, whereas unscreened Blacks preferred colonoscopy. Only 19% of the sample listed negative aspects.Blood-based screening for CRC was widely favored. Future research on medical decision-making should examine the basis for racial/ethnic differences in biomarker screening preferences.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636031","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.782119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.738002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.109722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sigmoidoscopy","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoidoscopy"},{"name":"SEPT9","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEPT9"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Fecal occult blood","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_occult_blood"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
