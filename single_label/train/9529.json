{"id":9529,"title":"Dispensable role of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and MyD88-dependent toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a murine model of osteoarthritis.","abstract":"The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of cell-membrane expressed TLRs and the signaling molecule MyD88 in a murine model of OA induced by knee menisectomy (surgical partial removal of the medial meniscus [MNX]).OA was induced in 8-10weeks old C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) female (n=7) mice and in knockout (KO) TLR-1 (n=7), -2 (n=8), -4 (n=9) -6 (n=5), MyD88 (n=8) mice by medial menisectomy, using the sham-operated contralateral knee as a control. Cartilage destruction and synovial inflammation were evaluated by knee joint histology using the OARSI scoring method. Apoptotic chondrocytes and cartilage metabolism (collagen II synthesis and MMP-mediated aggrecan degradation) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry.Operated knees exhibited OA features at 8weeks post-surgery compared to sham-operated ones. In menisectomized TLR-1, -2, -4, and -6 deficient mice, cartilage lesions, synovial inflammation and cartilage metabolism were similar to that in operated WT mice. Accordingly, using the same approach, we found no significant protection in MyD88-deficient mice in terms of OA progression as compared to WT littermates.Deficiency of TLRs or their signalling molecule MyD88 did not impact on the severity of experimental OA. Our results demonstrate that MyD88-dependent TLRs are not involved in this murine OA model. Moreover, the dispensable role of MyD88, which is also an adaptor for IL-1 receptor signaling, suggests that IL-1 is not a key mediator in the development of OA. This latter hypothesis is strengthened by the lack of efficiency of IL-1? antagonist in the treatment of OA.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Animal
