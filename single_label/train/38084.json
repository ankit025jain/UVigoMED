{"id":38084,"title":"Significance of sugar chain recognition by galectins and its involvement in disease-associated glycosylation.","abstract":"Galectins are ?-galactoside-binding lectins that participate in a wide range of biological processes. Galectins are distributed both inside and outside cells and are believed to have roles in both intra- and extracellular milieus. One of the well-recognized functions of galectins is stabilization of glycoproteins on the cell surface, thereby promoting stable signal transduction and transport of substances such as glucose. Glycoprotein-associated diseases, including congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG, previously called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome), comprise a disease family established only in the last decade. Although numerous in vitro glycobiology studies have been performed, including investigation of glycan-galectin interactions and of galectin action in cultured cells, a few in vivo studies have investigated molecular mechanisms of galectin actions in animal models. Both in vitro and in vivo studies are needed in order to better determine the biological significance of sugar chain recognition. Hitherto, some reports have focused on the role of impaired sugar chain recognition and galectin function in the development of diverse diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, colitis, and cancer. We recently focused on the function of galectins in immunity and embryogenesis, and in this review we summarize the diseases related to disorders of sugar chain-galectin interaction and discuss the role of galectins as potential risk factors for some congenital and acquired diseases. These diseases are disorders of immunity, metabolism, and cell differentiation. This approach to understanding the significance of sugar chain recognition by galectins may open up a new field into the nature of glycoprotein-related diseases, including CDG.
