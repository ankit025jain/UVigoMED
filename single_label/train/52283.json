{"id":52283,"title":"Clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of follicular thyroid carcinoma in a single institute over a 15-year period.","abstract":"This study was to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic features of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) in our institute over a 15-year period.The clinical features, management and outcome of 134 consecutive patients were analyzed according to the time of diagnosis: Group I (1997-2001), Group II (2002-2006), and Group III (2007-2011).As time advanced, the ratio of FTC to papillary thyroid carcinoma decreased from 8.7% in group I to 4.3% in group III (p = 0.000). The percentage of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy seemed to be more commonly used in the later periods - from 10.5% in group I to 21.8% in group II and 18.9% in group III. The median diameter of tumors in group I was 4.2 cm and it showed a sharp decrease to 2.8 cm in group II and 2.9 cm in group III respectively. There was a trend towards a higher stage in patients from Group I vs. patients from Groups II and III (stage IV, 15.8% vs. 2.2% and 4.3%, p = 0.072). The outcome was improved in terms of disease-free survival (DFS). The 3-year DFS rate improved from 77.8% in group I to 93.7% in group II and 100% in group III (p = 0.008).The clinical features, management and outcome of FTC patients changed over 15-year period. Patients diagnosed after 2001 had a better prognosis. This improvement was probably related to earlier diagnosis with smaller tumor size and presentation at earlier tumor stage.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613740","annotations":[{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.72151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.71431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.368006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Federal Trade Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Institute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Boron group","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"}]}
