{"id":60803,"title":"BK virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in a renal transplant recipient.","abstract":"Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a life-threatening hematological disorder in immunocompromised patients. Reactive HPS is observed in patients with systemic infection, neoplasia or auto-immune diseases. It is a rare hematological disorder after renal transplantation and must be suspected when fever and pancytopenia are seen in association with viral infections. HPS is usually associated with infection with the Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr viruses. We report here a case of BK-virus-associated HPS.
