{"id":91764,"title":"Three-dimensional imaging of children with severe limitation of pronation/supination after a both-bone forearm fracture.","abstract":"Although both-bone forearm fractures in children may result in severe limitation of forearm rotation, finding the cause remains a diagnostic challenge. This study tries to evaluate the role of rotational malunion, bony impingement and contractures of the interosseous membrane.Children (5-16 years) who suffered from a both-bone forearm fracture in diaphysis or distal metaphysis with a limitation of pronation/supination ?40° at ?6 months after trauma were included for analysis with conventional radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).A total of 410 children with a both-bone forearm fracture were prospectively followed in four Dutch hospitals. At a median of 205 days, 7.3 % suffered from a limitation of pronation/supination ?40°. 14 children were included (median limitation of 40°) and the radiographs revealed a median maximum angular malunion of 16°. CT analysis showed rotational malunion of both radius (median 19°) and ulna (median 9°). MRI analysis revealed neither bony impingement nor contractures of the interosseous membrane.Three-dimensional imaging of children with a severe limitation of pronation/supination after a both-bone forearm fracture revealed rotational malunions of both radius and ulna without bony impingement or soft tissue contractures.Prospective multicenter study, Level 2.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477288","annotations":[{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.79541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.66794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.585048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.361138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Metaphysis","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.124282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Interosseous membrane of forearm","weight":0.0439684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interosseous_membrane_of_forearm"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"}]}
