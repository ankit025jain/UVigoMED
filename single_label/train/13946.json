{"id":13946,"title":"Novel vaccine regimen elicits strong airway immune responses and control of respiratory syncytial virus in nonhuman primates.","abstract":"Induction of long-lasting immunity against viral respiratory tract infections remains an elusive goal. Using a nonhuman primate model of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection, we compared mucosal and systemic immune responses induced by different DNA delivery approaches to a novel parenteral DNA prime-tonsillar adenoviral vector booster immunization regimen. Intramuscular (i.m.) electroporation (EP) of a DNA vaccine encoding the fusion protein of hRSV induced stronger systemic immune responses than intradermal EP, tattoo immunization, and conventional i.m. DNA injection. A single EP i.m., followed by two atraumatic tonsillar immunizations with the adenoviral vector, elicited strong systemic immune responses, an unique persistent CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell response in the lower respiratory tract and protection from intranasal hRSV challenge. Thus, parenteral DNA priming followed by booster immunization targeted to a mucosal inductive site constitutes an effective vaccine regimen for eliciting protective immune responses at mucosal effector sites.The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the most common cause of severe respiratory tract disease in infancy and leads to substantial morbidity and morality in the elderly. In this study, we compared the immunogenicity and efficacy of several gene-based immunization protocols in rhesus macaques. Thereby, we found that the combination of an initially parenterally delivered DNA vaccine with a subsequent atraumatic tonsillar adenoviral vector immunization results in a strong systemic immune response accompanied by an exceptional high T-cell response in the mucosa. Strikingly, these animals were protected against a RSV challenge infection controlling the viral replication indicated by a 1,000-fold-lower viral load in the lower respiratory tract. Since mucosal cellular responses of this strength had not been described in earlier RSV vaccine studies, this heterologous DNA prime-tonsillar boost vaccine strategy is very promising and should be pursued for further preclinical and clinical testing.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Animal
