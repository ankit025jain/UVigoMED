{"id":46678,"title":"High serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and transforming growth factor-?1 before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy predict poor outcomes in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receiving combined modality therapy.","abstract":"This study was aimed at using proximity ligation assay (PLA) followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify serum biomarkers that predict treatment response and survival for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by esophagectomy.Seventy-nine patients with ESCC receiving CCRT of taxane-based/5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and 40 Gy followed by surgery were enrolled. Serum samples were collected before and <1 month after CCRT. Fifteen biomarkers were analyzed using PLA. Biomarkers significantly correlating with pathological response/survival were verified by ELISA. Associations of the serum level of biomarkers and clinical factors with pathological response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by analysis of variance and log-rank tests.Thirty patients had complete response (38 %), 37 had microscopic residual disease (47 %), and 12 had macroscopic residual disease (15 %). With a median follow-up of 52.8 months, the median DFS was 43 months. Among the 15 biomarkers screened by PLA, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 were significantly associated with pathological response and/or DFS. These biomarkers were further analyzed by ELISA to confirm initial biomarker findings by PLA. After ELISA of these two markers, only VEGF-A levels were significantly correlated with pathological response. On multivariate analysis, patients with combined high pre-CCRT VEGF-A and TGF-?1 levels (greater than or equal to the median), independent of pathological response, had significantly worse DFS (11 months vs. median not reached; p = 0.007) and OS (16 vs. 46 months; p = 0.07).Pre-CCRT serum VEGF-A and TGF-?1 levels may be used to predict pathological response and survivals for ESCC patients receiving combined-modality therapy.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623035","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.82393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.731276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.715845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.709053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.69962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.667628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.48306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.392511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.306188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0879263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
