{"id":62111,"title":"Pattern of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor-?/? gene rearrangements in Iranian children with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells have unique rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), immunoglobulin light chain (IgK), and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, which can be used as markers for clonality assay and evaluation of minimal residual disease. In this study, we have evaluated the pattern of IgH, IgK chains, and TCRG/D gene rearrangements in precursor-B ALL.In our prospective study, hyper-variable regions (CDRI and III) of IgH, TCRD (V?2-D?3 and D?2-D?3), TCRG (V?, V?I, and V?II), and IgK (V?-Kde) were studied in 126 cases with diagnosis of B-precursor ALL.One hundred and fourteen (90.5%) out of 126 patients had clonal rearrangements of IgH using consensus primers for CDRI and/or CDRIII regions. Monoclonal, biclonal, and oligoclonal patterns were observed in 63 (57.8%), 38 (34.9%), and 6 (5.5%) patients with IgH (CDRIII) rearrangements, respectively. Clonal rearrangements of TCRG (V?) and V?I/II were present in 79.3 and 64.9% of patients, respectively, and only 5% of cases showed biclonal pattern. The V?II rearrangement was the most common (46.8%) type in TCRG. V?2-D?3 and D?2-D?3 partial gene rearrangements were observed in 47 (45.2%; n = 104) and 11 (16.6%; n = 66) patients, respectively. Biclonal/oligoclonal patterns were present in 13 (27.7%) and 2 (4.3%) cases with V?2-D?3 rearrangement, respectively. Only one patient had biclonal D?2-D?3 rearrangement. Clonal pattern of IgK-Kde was detected in 59 cases (67%; n = 88).Our findings showed that clonal rearrangements of IgH and TCRD (V?2-D?3 and D?2-D?3) genes had similar patterns to other studies. Frequency of TCRG (V?I and V?II) and IgK rearrangements was found to be slightly higher than previous reports. Among the IgK rearrangements, VKI (25%) was the most common.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620952","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.731015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.663138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.519348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heavy chain","weight":0.44089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_chain"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.408618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.315191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Hypervariable region","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervariable_region"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin heavy chain","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Chain (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Central Drug Research Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Drug_Research_Institute"},{"name":"Clonal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
