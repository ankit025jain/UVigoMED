{"id":83822,"title":"Patient-centered outcomes following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: a systematic review of the current literature.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to systematically review patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) and assess quality of life, pain, functionality, and patient satisfaction.MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane database search identified 880 relevant articles. After the limits were applied, 14 articles were accepted for review. The analysis included health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures including quality of life, pain, function, satisfaction, and mental and emotional well-being.Fourteen studies were reviewed. Mean study size was 92.6 subjects (24 to 306) and mean defect size was 71.7 cm(2). LVHR improved the overall HRQoL in 6 of the 8 studies. Thirteen studies assessing pain demonstrated improved pain scores relative to preoperative levels and long-term follow up. LVHR was not associated with long-term pain. Functionality improved in 12 studies. Return to work ranged from 6 to 18 days postoperatively in 50% of studies and physical function scores improved in the remaining 50% of the studies. Patient satisfaction improved after LVHR in all studies assessing patient satisfaction. Fixation methods did not influence HRQoL. Laparoscopic repair was associated with improving mental and emotional well-being in 6 of the 7 studies.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241956","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.605063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.540992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.37488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.29899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0827834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0314217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"306","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/306"},{"name":"880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/880"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
