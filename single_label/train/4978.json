{"id":4978,"title":"[Operation for the treatment of radial head fracture with collapse of anterior articular surface].","abstract":"To evaluate clinical outcomes of fixation for the treatment of radial head fracture with collapse of anterior articular surface.From March 2006 to January 2013,17 patients with radial head fractures with collapse of anterior articular surface were analysed. According to the Mason classification, there were 12 cases with Mason type II fractures and 5 cases with Mason type III fractures. All the patients were treated with open reduction through posterolateral entrance of elbow joint and Herbert or titanium cannulated screw internal fixation.All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 6 to 18 months, with a mean of 11.3 months. According to the Broberg and Morrey score system, 2 patients got an excellent result, 12 good and 3 fair. There were no complications such as infection of elbow joint, nerve injury, non-union, traumatic osteoarthritis, heterotopic ossification and elbow instability. However, the postoperative activity range of elbow in the injuried side was less than that in the normal side.Radial head fracture with collapse of anterior articular surface is easily misdiagnosed, and it can be treated with open reduction and internal fixation through posterolateral entrance.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464599","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Head of radius","weight":0.605695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_radius"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.600262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.488368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.347438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.28817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.10245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heterotopic ossification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopic_ossification"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Charles B.
