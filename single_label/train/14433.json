{"id":14433,"title":"The effect of type of shade on physiology, behaviour and performance of grazing steers.","abstract":"Research has addressed the issue of type of shade mainly on feedlots and high-producing dairy farms, but more studies are needed on the impact of shade on grazing beef cattle in a low-to-medium plane of nutrition. A 63-day grazing study using 24 British steers (268 ± 4 kg) was undertaken in Uruguay (33°14'S, 54°15'W) to determine the effect of type of artificial shade on tympanic temperature (TT), behaviour and performance during summer. Cattle were allocated to six paddocks with an area of 2.5 ha each (four steers/paddock) continuously grazed. Treatments (two paddocks/treatment) were unshaded (US) and shaded with either 35% (35S) or 80% (80S) blockage of solar radiation. TT was recorded during 12 days placing an automatic device near the tympanic membrane inside the animal's ear. Animal behaviours were measured by live observations of animals every 15 min from 1100 to 1600 h six times during the experimental period. According to the temperature-humidity index (THI), cattle was in the 'normal' category (THI<70, absence of heat stress) during 50% of the time, the rest being exposed to some degree of heat stress including 15% of the time with environmental conditions. Black globe temperature and surface soil temperature decreased as solar protection increased under the shade structure. Steers spent more time under the 80S structure than under the 35S between 1100 and 1600 h (83% and 49% of the time, respectively). Average 24-h TT did not differ among treatments (mean ± s.e. 38.79 ± 0.04ºC). Minimum TT was registered at 0700 h for all treatments (37.92 ± 0.08ºC), whereas maximum TT was reached at 1700 h for both control group (39.73 ± 0.18ºC) and 35% shade (39.48 ± 0.12ºC) and at 1900 h for 80% shade (39.57 ± 0.15ºC). Neither the provision nor the type of shade affected animal performance (0.622 ± 0.060 kg/a per day), indicating the ability of cattle to acclimate and/or compensate for eventually short-term severe heat stress events. The results of this experiment suggest that the provision of shade with either 35% or 80% of blockage of solar radiation is recommended for the improvement of cattle well-being (expressed through changes in behaviour) without significantly affecting animal performance and TT. However, the overall results of the 63 days of the study can mask or dilute punctual effects of short heat stress events on cattle. More powerful experimental designs are required to address this issue in temperate regions.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Animal
