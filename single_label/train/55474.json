{"id":55474,"title":"MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 protein levels in human aqueous humor: relationship with axial length.","abstract":"We measured the aqueous humor levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 in patients with myopia or cataract, and investigated the relationship between their levels and axial length (AL).We measured MMP/TIMPs levels with the Luminex xMAP Technology by using commercially available Milliplex xMAP Kits. A total of 65 aqueous humor samples was collected from patients with myopia or cataract during cataract or clear lens extraction surgery. According to the AL, the samples were divided into three groups: group A, AL ? 24 mm; group B, AL 24 to 26 mm; and group C, AL ? 26 mm.Levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 could be detected in the aqueous humor. The levels of MMP-2, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 were positively correlated with AL. The differences of the levels of these MMPs/TIMPs among the three groups were statistically significant. The MMP-3 levels were not correlated with AL and there was no significant difference in MMP-3 levels among these three groups. Levels of MMP-1 could not be detected in the aqueous humor samples.Elevated levels of aqueous MMP-2, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 were found in the eyes with elongated axis.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24876280","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.642039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.617984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.161516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"MMP1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP1"},{"name":"TIMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMP2"},{"name":"TIMP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMP3"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Alabama","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"MMP3","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP3"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
