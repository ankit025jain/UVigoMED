{"id":78011,"title":"Observation of permeability of blood-labyrinth barrier during cytomegalovirus-induced hearing loss.","abstract":"Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common infectious cause of sensorineural hearing loss in children. This study aims to investigate the pathogenesis CMV-induced hearing loss from the view of integrity of blood-labyrinth-barrier (BLB).Newborn BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups (n=22, respectively): CMV group, control group and normal group. The CMV group and control group were intracerebrally injected with equal volume (15 ?l) of murine CMV (MCMV; 10(4)IU/0.1 ml) and PBS, respectively, and normal group did not receive any treatment. After three weeks, auditory-evoked brainstem response was assessed, and permeability of BLB was evaluated by Evans blue method. Means between groups were compared using t-test.We observed that mice injected with MCMV had a hearing loss and it was connected with the permeability changes of BLB. Besides, using hematoxylin-eosin staining, we noticed hyperaemia in stria vascularis and spiral ligament and bleeding in scala vestibule and scala tympani in CMV group.All these data indicated the possible association between CMV-induced hearing loss and BLB dysfunction with the characteristics of inflammation. Our data provide a possible path to investigate the mechanism of CMV-induced hearing damage.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814236","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.741734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.689899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.566432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.398625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.344534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0950163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Timpani","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timpani"},{"name":"Hyperaemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaemia"},{"name":"Scala tympani","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_tympani"},{"name":"Evans blue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_blue"},{"name":"Stria vascularis of cochlear duct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stria_vascularis_of_cochlear_duct"},{"name":"Spiral ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_ligament"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Spiral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Stretch marks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch_marks"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Basketball League Belgium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_League_Belgium"},{"name":"Vestibule (architecture)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_(architecture)"}]}
