{"id":30841,"title":"UWA-121, a mixed dopamine and serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, enhances L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action without worsening dyskinesia or psychosis-like behaviours in the MPTP-lesioned common marmoset.","abstract":"L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its long-term administration is complicated by wearing-off and dyskinesia. UWA-101, a dual, equipotent inhibitor of dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT) transporters, has previously been shown to successfully extend duration of anti-parkinsonian benefit of L-DOPA (ON-time), without exacerbating dyskinesia, in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. However, UWA-101 is racemic and it is unclear whether one or both enantiomers contribute to its actions, and whether a better therapeutic effect might be attained by using a single antipode. In the current study, we synthesised the two enantiomers of UWA-101, R-101 (UWA-121) and S-101 (UWA-122), characterised their pharmacological profiles and administered them to MPTP-lesioned marmosets. Parkinsonism, dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours and duration of ON-time were evaluated. UWA-121 is a dual DAT > SERT inhibitor, with an approximate 10:1 DAT:SERT affinity ratio (inhibitory constants (Ki) of 307 and 3830 nM, respectively). In combination with L-DOPA, UWA-121 extended duration of ON-time when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle treatment (by 40%, P < 0.01). UWA-121 also extended duration of ON-time without dyskinesia (by 215%, P < 0.05) and ON-time without psychosis-like behaviours when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle treatment (by 345%, P < 0.01). UWA-121 did not worsen the severity of dyskinesia or psychosis-like behaviours (P > 0.05). UWA-122 is a selective SERT inhibitor (Ki 120 nM, Ki at DAT > 50 ?M) and, in combination with L-DOPA, had no effect on ON-time, dyskinesia or psychosis-like behaviours (P > 0.05). These data indicate that dual DAT and SERT inhibitors effectively enhance L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action without worsening dyskinesia and that compounds with such a pharmacological profile represent promising agents against wearing-off in PD.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447715","annotations":[{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Racemic mixture","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racemic_mixture"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Serotonin transporter","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_transporter"},{"name":"Enantiomer","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.734816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.711647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.630079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.628381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.609335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Dopamine transporter","weight":0.581159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.490465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.487269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.329769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.315321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Antiparkinson","weight":0.151923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparkinson"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"}]}
