{"id":67551,"title":"[Influence of phytotherapy on pro- and antioxidant status in spermatozoa, seminal plasma and immunologic status of sperm in men with chronic inflammation of the urogenital tract complicated by infertility].","abstract":"The lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes in the blood of men with oligosymptomatic forms of chronic inflammation of the urogenital tract complicated by infertility are studied. Studied cytokine status of sperm in infertile men. The positive effect of imupret in combination with gepatomax on the oxidative activity systems, which leads to an improvement of leukocyte subpopulations of sperm, to normalize the concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and therefore, an increase in fertilizing are shown.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605643","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.450248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"}]}
