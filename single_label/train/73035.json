{"id":73035,"title":"[Management of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis in children].","abstract":"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a new category of severe, potentially treatable autoimmune encephalitis and can appear in patients of all ages, but more frequently in children. It is a highly characteristic syndrome evolving in five stages: the prodromal phase (viral infection-like symptoms), psychotic phase, unresponsive phase, hyperkinetic phase, and gradual recovery phase. The treatment for this disorder includes first-line immunotherapy (steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis), second-line immunotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide), and tumor removal. Hereby the progresses, selections and shortcomings of the treatment protocols for this disease are introduced.
