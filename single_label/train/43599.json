{"id":43599,"title":"Anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin in a rat model of  caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the protective effect of melatonin in a rat model of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. For the induction of experimental acute pancreatitis, four subcutaneous injections of caerulein (20 mgkg–1 body weight) were given to Wistar rats at 2-h intervals. Melatonin was injected intraperitoneally (25 mg kg–1 body weight) 30 min before each caerulein injection. After 12 h, rats were sacrificed by decapitation. Blood and pancreas samples were collected and processed for serological and histopathological studies,respectively. Lipase, a-amylase, corticosterone, total antioxidant power and cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-4 and tumour necrosis factor(TNF)-a were determined using commercial kits. ANOVA and Tukey tests (P<0.05) were performed for the statistical analysis of the results.Results showed that the administration of melatonin reduced histological damage induced by caerulein treatment as well as the hyperamylasemia and hyperlipidemia. Corticosterone and antioxidant total power were also reverted to basal activities. Furthermore, melatonin pre-treatment reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a and increased the serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4. In conclusion,the findings suggest that the protective effect of melatonin in caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis is mediated by the anti-inflammatory ability of this indolamine. Thus, melatonin may have a protective effect against acute pancreatitis.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779037","annotations":[{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.905841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.770783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Corticosterone","weight":0.643679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.619441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.563986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.437655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
