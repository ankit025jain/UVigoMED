{"id":50976,"title":"Plasma GDF-15 levels and their association with hormonal and metabolic status in women with polycystic ovary syndrome aged 25-35.","abstract":"We aimed to determine plasma levels of growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 and their possible association with hormonal and metabolic status as well as echocardiographic profiles and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CAIMT) measurements in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Forty-two obese PCOS women aged 25-35 years, 23 women with idiopathic hirsutism and 20 healthy controls matched for age and body mass index were enrolled. Anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal patterns, plasma GDF-15 concentrations, CAIMT, and conventional echocardiographic parameters were measured.Metabolic/lipid profiles as well as GDF-15 levels were similar across the three groups. CAIMT tended to be higher in PCOS group but did not reach statistical significance. No between-group differences were found in the conventional echocardiographic parameters. Analysis of PCOS patients showed a significant correlation of GDF-15 concentrations with age and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (r=0.319, P<0.05, and r=0.312, P<0.05, respectively). In multiple linear regression analyses, GDF-15 was significantly associated with age (r2=0.102, P<0.05), and HOMA index (r2=0.10, P<0.05).Plasma GDF-15 levels, CAIMT and conventional echocardiographic parameters in obese subjects with PCOS (25-35 yrs old) were comparable to those in either subjects with idiopathic hirsutism or healthy controls with similar anthropometric and metabolic profiles, suggesting that PCOS alone could not impart an early and higher risk independent of associated risk factors. GDF-15 might provide a link between future diabetes and cardiovascular risk in PCOS women.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736483","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.77844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.734308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.642552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.569608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.496321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.444669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.43179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.34099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.280056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.248181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.13456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Metabolomics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics"}]}
