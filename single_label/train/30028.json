{"id":30028,"title":"Chimeric plantibody passively protects mice against aerosolized ricin challenge.","abstract":"Recent incidents in the United States and abroad have heightened concerns about the use of ricin toxin as a bioterrorism agent. In this study, we produced, using a robust plant-based platform, four chimeric toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that were then evaluated for the ability to passively protect mice from a lethal-dose ricin challenge. The most effective antibody, c-PB10, was further evaluated in mice as a therapeutic following ricin exposure by injection and inhalation.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574537","annotations":[{"name":"Ricin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricin"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.546141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.511614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.401498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.113933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Plantibody","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantibody"},{"name":"Bioterrorism","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"}]}
