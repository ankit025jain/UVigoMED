{"id":15975,"title":"Cutaneous infection by Alternaria infectoria in a liver transplant recipient: a case report.","abstract":"We report the case of a 65-year-old man who developed multiple crusty ulcerative skin lesions on both lower extremities six months after liver transplantation. The causative pathogen was identified as Alternaria Infectoria, an opportunistic fungal agent. The patient was successfully treated with fluconazole for 27 weeks, with complete regression of the lesions. Due to the lack of well-designed clinical studies it is difficult to determine the best treatment course regarding solid organ transplant recipients presenting with invasive fungal infections. And for now, the clinician must lean upon case-reports or retrospective analyses to compose the most suited therapy for his patient. Based upon literature, it seems that the combination of a broad spectrum azole and reducing the dose of immunosuppressive drugs is the cornerstone of treating invasive fungal infections in solid organ transplant patients.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090825","annotations":[{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.790478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.679271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.66182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Azole","weight":0.447047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azole"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.14532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"Alternaria","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternaria"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
