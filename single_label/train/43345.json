{"id":43345,"title":"Factors associated with efficacy of pegylated interferon-? plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C after renal transplantation.","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the major cause of chronic liver disease after renal transplantation (RT), which reduces both graft and patient survival. After RT, the most widely used approach is interferon (IFN)-based therapy of hepatitis C which may be unsatisfactory with both poor efficacy and an increasing risk of allograft rejection. Thus, it is not recommended unless patients develop fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Several recent studies, however, suggest that treatment was possible with preservation of both renal and liver functions. From the limited studies on HCV infection after RT, several factors have been identified as important tools for the management of therapy in these patients. Infection with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, low baseline viral load and absence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in the liver are associated with a sustained virologic response (SVR). After initiation of treatment, initial viral decline with undetectable HCV-RNA at week 4 of therapy (RVR) is the best predictor of SVR independent of HCV genotype. Furthermore, some factors must be taken into consideration in order to avoid allograft rejection, such as the time between transplantation and therapy for HCV, the dose and duration of regimen and renal function. Careful evaluation of predictions of stable renal function and SVR for those patients helps to reduce inefficient treatment regimes and to increase the cure rate in addition to reducing the possible risk. In this review, the latest information was collected and we focus on the discussion of the factors influencing the attainment of SVR after RT.
