{"id":92081,"title":"Femoral head and neck excision arthroplasty in a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis).","abstract":"Cases of femoral head and neck excision arthroplasty are infrequently reported in reptiles, and details of surgical technique and clinical outcome in chelonia are lacking. An adult female leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) was presented with chronic non-weight-bearing lameness of the left hind limb. Examination and radiography were consistent with coxofemoral luxation, and as a result of the chronic presentation, surgical intervention was recommended. A cranial approach to the joint via the prefemoral fossa afforded good surgical exposure. A depressed lytic acetabular lesion was noted during the procedure, postulated to be a result of abnormal wear from the luxated femoral head. A fiberglass prop was used during recovery to allow extension of the limb without full weight-bearing. Lameness persisted postoperatively, but limb usage significantly improved.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450058","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.739426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.680377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.653213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Reptile","weight":0.590303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.580672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Leopard","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.361706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.287191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Tortoise","weight":0.242065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoise"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Turtle","weight":0.152162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.146893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Leopard tortoise","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_tortoise"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Head and neck anatomy","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_anatomy"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hindlimb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindlimb"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"}]}
