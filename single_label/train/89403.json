{"id":89403,"title":"Central stentoplasty: technique for unipedicular single midline vertebral body stent implantation.","abstract":"Vertebral body stenting, or stentoplasty, is a novel percutaneous option in spinal cement augmentation. Conventional stentoplasty requires insertion of two paramedian stents per vertebral body through a bipedicular approach. We developed an unipedicular approach in which we implant a single stent into the midline of the vertebral body using cone-beam CT guidance and hereby describe the technical details and feasibility, in this technique that we termed \"central stentoplasty.\" ","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722893","annotations":[{"name":"Stent","weight":0.643645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.631909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.542431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.484367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.443607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Body of vertebra","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_vertebra"},{"name":"Central Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Mean line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"}]}
