{"id":34417,"title":"[Impact of excessive weight gain during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcome at the Yaound√© Women's and Children's Hospital (Cameroon)].","abstract":"Excessive weight gain (EWG) during pregnancy can cause maternal and fetal complications. It has not yet been studied in our social environment, however.Our study aimed to describe maternal and fetal outcome in women gaining excessive weight during pregnancy in Cameroon.This cross-sectional descriptive study took place over a two-month period. Women were interviewed after delivery and grouped in two categories: those who did and did not have EWG during pregnancy. The complications due to EWG were analyzed.The frequency of EWG in pregnancy was 35.5%. The incidence of high blood pressure was 9.8% for patients with EWG, and 6% for those with normal weight gains (P = 0.301). The mean birth weight of the babies of women with EWG was 3,433 g, significantly higher than the 3,103.7 g (P = 0.001) of the babies in the other group. Patients with EWG had significantly fewer babies with low birth weight (P<0.05) and significantly more with macrosomia (P<0.01). The cesarean rate was higher, but not significantly so, for women with EWG (23.2% vs 16.1%, P = 0.187); this was the case as well for postpartum hemorrhage and (1- and 5-min) Apgar scores as well.EWG is associated with a higher incidence of macrosomia, but does not significantly increase the rate of cesarean births or modify the Apgar scores.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736217","annotations":[{"name":"Large for gestational age","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_for_gestational_age"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.723269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Apgar score","weight":0.21235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"}]}
