{"id":44964,"title":"XPF-673C>T polymorphism effect on the susceptibility to esophageal cancer in Chinese population.","abstract":"Xeroderma pigmentsum group F (XPF) plays a pivotal role in DNA nucleotide excision repair and has been linked to the development of various cancers. This study aims to assess the association of XPF genetic variants with the susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Chinese population.This two-stage case-control study was conducted in a total of 1524 patients with ESCC and 1524 controls. Genotype of XPF -673C>T and 11985A>G variants were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Our case-control study showed that XPF -673TT genotype was associated with a decreased risk of ESCC compared with CC genotype in both case-control sets (Tangshan set: OR?=?0.58; 95%CI?=?0.34-0.99, P?=?0.040; Beijing set: OR?=?0.66; 95%CI?=?0.46-0.95, P?=?0.027). Stratified analyses revealed that a multiplicative interaction between -673C>T variant and age, sex or smoking status was evident (Gene-age: Pinteraction?=?0.002; Gene-sex: Pinteraction?=?0.002; Gene-smoking: Pinteraction?=?0.002). For XPF 11985A>G polymorphism, there was no significant difference of genotype distribution between ESCC cases and controls.These findings indicated that genetic variants in XPF might contribute to the susceptibility to ESCC.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709955","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.747178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.726497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.717747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.484022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.436476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.372526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.29681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.143073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Excision repair","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excision_repair"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"}]}
