{"id":92334,"title":"Influence of fear-avoidance beliefs on disability in patients with subacromial shoulder pain in primary care: a secondary analysis.","abstract":"Little information exists about the role of fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing in subacromial pain syndrome.The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations among pain, catastrophizing, fear, and disability and the contribution of fear-avoidance beliefs to disability at baseline and at 3-month follow-up.A cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis was conducted.Baseline demographic and clinical data, including fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing, of 90 patients were assessed for this analysis. Disability was measured with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. First, bivariate and partial correlations were calculated among pain, fear-avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, and disability, based on the fear-avoidance model. Second, the contribution of fear-avoidance beliefs to disability at baseline and at 3-month follow-up was examined with hierarchical regression analyses.Correlations between clinical variables and disability were largely in line with the fear-avoidance model. Regression analyses identified a significant contribution of fear-avoidance beliefs to baseline disability but not to disability at 3 months.Patients with subacromial pain syndrome were studied; therefore, the results should be transferred with caution to other diagnoses. A modified version of the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire was used, which was not validated for this patient group.Fear-avoidance beliefs contribute significantly to baseline disability but not to disability change scores after 3-month follow-up. Duration of complaints and baseline disability were the main factors influencing disability change scores. Although the results help to improve understanding of the role of fear-avoidance beliefs, further studies are needed to fully understand the influence of psychological and clinical factors on the development of disability in patients with subacromial shoulder pain.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060955","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.61624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.559736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.502309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.497191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.414618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.375548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.35878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.331007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.153154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.143593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
