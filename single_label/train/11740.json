{"id":11740,"title":"Pharmacological characteristics and efficacy of a novel anti-angiogenic antibody FD006 in corneal neovascularization.","abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key angiogenic factors. It plays an important role in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increases permeability across the vessels. Using antibody phage display technology, we obtained a novel anti-VEGFA IgG, named as FD006. In this study, the pharmacological characteristics and efficacy of FD006 in corneal neovascularization (CoNV) were evaluated.FD006 was predicted to have similar binding mode to bevacizumab. Experimental analysis showed that the binding ability of FD006 seemed a little stronger than bevacizumab, for the EC50 of FD006 to bind VEGF analyzed by ELISA was about 0.037 ?g/mL while that of bevacizumab was 0.18 ?g/mL. Binding kinetics assays showed similar results that FD006 possessed 2-fold higher affinity to bind VEGF than bevacizumab due to slower dissociation rate of FD006; meanwhile, FD006 inhibited the VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC with an IC50 value of 0.031?±?0.0064 ?g/ml, which seemed similar or a litter better than bevacizumab (0.047?±?0.0081 ?g/ml). The subconjunctival administration of FD006, bevacizumab or dexamethasone could significantly inhibit the growth of CoNV contrasting to N.S (p?<?0.01). At the early stage, FD006 showed better inhibitory effect on the growth of CoNV compared with bevacizumab (p?<?0.05). Western blot analysis showed that FD006 could inhibit the expression of VEGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, MMP-9 and ICAM-1, which could explain its favorable anti-angiogenic activity.The pharmacological characteristics of FD006 were similar or even a little better than bevacizumab in inhibiting corneal neovascularization.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Animal
