{"id":62367,"title":"Pericardiectomy for treatment of neoplastic constrictive pericarditis.","abstract":"To share our results of a case series of 8 patients who underwent pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis that developed secondary to a known neoplastic disease.The underlying neoplasia was lung cancer in 5 (62.5%) patients, malignant pleural mesothelioma in 2 (25%), and Hodgkin lymphoma in 1 (12.5%). A diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis was made primarily by echocardiography, and right heart catheterization was performed in 6 (75%) patients. Total pericardiectomy was defined as wide excision of the anterior pericardium. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview and the civil registry database.Time from initial diagnosis of the neoplastic disease ranged from 1 to 15 years. Total pericardiectomy was performed in 6 (75%) patients. Histopathological examination revealed atypical cells in evacuated fluid and pericardial material in 6 patients. Nonspecific inflammation and fibrosis were observed in the other 2 cases. Hospital death occurred in 1 (12.5%) patient. Postoperative low cardiac output syndrome occurred in 7 (87.5%) patients. Follow-up ranged from 2.92 to 26.78 months. Mean survival was 14.82 Â± 4.4 months.Pericardial constriction may develop a long time after the initial presentation of certain neoplastic diseases, and the prognosis after pericardiectomy is poor.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585905","annotations":[{"name":"Mesothelioma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Pericarditis","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericarditis"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cardiac output","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cardiac catheterization","weight":0.792177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Pericardial effusion","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_effusion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.633844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.607037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Right heart","weight":0.267399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_heart"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.201457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Constrictive pericarditis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrictive_pericarditis"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0294737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
