{"id":21570,"title":"Eradication of active infective endocarditis with submitral abscess infiltrating to annular calcification.","abstract":"The case is reported of a 72-year-old man in whom surgery was performed to treat infective endocarditis in association with mitral leaflet vegetation, a submitral abscess that penetrated the pericardial cavity, and posterior mitral annular calcification. Extensive debridement of the posterior left ventricle and atrium, posterior mitral annulus and mitral annular calcification was performed, after which the atrioventricular wall was reconstructed using a theta-shaped patch and a biological mitral valve replaced.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597410","annotations":[{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.812073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.679096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.565781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.0593413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0516556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.0439684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_fibrosus_disci_intervertebralis"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaflet"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Atrioventricular node","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_node"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Vegetation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"}]}
