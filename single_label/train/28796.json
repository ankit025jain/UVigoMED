{"id":28796,"title":"Towards a unitary perspective between post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder. Heroin use disorder as case study.","abstract":"Genetic, neurobiological, environmental and psychosocial mechanisms have received considerable attention in exploring the mechanisms that underlie comorbid PTSD and SUD. PTSD and SUD are not necessarily linked by a causal relationship, as the self-medication hypothesis had supposed. They might, in fact, both be caused by a third factor that predisposes these subjects to develop the two disorders (so allowing a unitary perspective).Using a conceptualization of the PTSD spectrum, we studied the PTSD-SUD unitary perspective by testing the correlation between severity of heroin addiction, dose of opioid medication and severity of PTSD spectrum in 82 methadone-treated, heroin-dependent patients.Canonical correlation analysis (Wilks Lambda=0.125F=1.41 p=0.014), univariate and multivariate comparisons between subgroups, identified on the basis of addiction severity, showed a highly positive correlation between the PTSD spectrum and the severity of heroin addiction. In addition, negative correlations were found between PTSD spectrum severity and methadone dose (r=0.225; p=0.042).This strength and breadth of the correlations encourage us to move towards a unified vision of the two disorders.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791684","annotations":[{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.604047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.598088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.398854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Opioid dependence","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_dependence"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"}]}
