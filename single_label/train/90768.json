{"id":90768,"title":"Increased survival after irradiation followed by regeneration of bone marrow stromal cells with a novel thiol-based radioprotector.","abstract":"To investigate the survival of laboratory rats after irradiation and to study the cellularity of their bone marrow and the multipotential mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in groups treated with or without a new thiol-based radioprotector (GM2011).Animals were irradiated by a Cobalt gamma source at 6.7 Gy. Treated animals were given i.p. GM2011 30 minutes before and 3 and 7 hours after irradiation. Controls consisted of sham irradiated animals without treatment and animals treated without irradiation. After 30 days post-irradiation, animals were sacrificed and bone marrow cells were prepared from isolated femurs. A colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assay was performed to obtain the number of BM-MSCs.In the treated group, 87% of animals survived, compared to only 30% in the non-treated irradiated group. Irradiation induced significant changes in the bone marrow of the treated rats (total bone marrow cellularity was reduced by~60%--from 63 to 28 cells × 10(6)/femur and the frequency of the CFU-F per femur by~70% - from 357 to 97), however GL2011 almost completely prevented the suppressive effect observed on day 30 post-irradiation (71 cells × 10(6)/femur and 230 CFU-F/femur).Although the irradiation dosage was relatively high, GL2011 acted as a very effective new radioprotector. The recovery of the BN-MSCs and their counts support the effectiveness of the studied radioprotector.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577826","annotations":[{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Cobalt","weight":0.802094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.544757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.440536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.358458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.329832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.171152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Laboratory rat","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0812108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"General Motors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors"},{"name":"Greenland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"357","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/357"},{"name":"Heterozygote advantage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage"},{"name":"Arthropod leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod_leg"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"}]}
