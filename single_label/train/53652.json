{"id":53652,"title":"Treatment strategy for rectal cancer with synchronous metastasis: 65 consecutive Italian cases from the Bologna Multidisciplinary Rectal Cancer Group.","abstract":"Twenty percent of rectal cancer patients have synchronous distant metastasis at diagnosis. At present, the treatment strategy in this patient setting is not well defined. This study in one institution evaluates the treatment strategy of three different patient groups.Between January 2000 and July 2011, 65 patients with M1 rectal cancer were evaluated. Three different groups were defined: rectal cancer with resectable metastatic disease (group A); rectal cancer with potentially resectable metastatic disease (group B), and rectal cancer with unresectable metastatic disease (group C).Group A included 11 patients (16.9%), group B 28 patients (43.1%) and group C 26 patients (40%). Forty-three (66.2%) patients underwent surgery for primary rectal cancer, and 30 (46.2%) patients for metastasis resection (23 liver, 4 lung and 3 ovary). Median overall survival (OS) by group was: 51 (5-86; group A), 32 (24-40; group B) and 16 (7-26; group C) months. Patients undergoing metastasis resection have higher median OS than unresected patients (44 vs. 15 months; p < 0.001).The treatment strategy in synchronous metastatic rectal cancer must consider the possibility of distant metastasis resection. Long-term survival can be achieved using an integrated approach.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504268","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.784657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.618276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.249893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.23322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bologna","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Julian calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"726","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/726"},{"name":"25th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25th_century_BC"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"}]}
