{"id":40702,"title":"Clinical outcomes and improved survival in patients with protein-losing enteropathy after the Fontan operation.","abstract":"Patients with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) following the Fontan operation have a reported 50% mortality at 5 years after diagnosis.The aim of this study was to review outcomes in patients with PLE following the Fontan operation.From 1992 to 2010, 42 patients (55% male) with PLE following the Fontan operation were identified from clinical databases at the Mayo Clinic. Data were collected retrospectively.Mean age at PLE diagnosis was 18.9 ± 11.0 years. Initial Fontan operation was performed at 10.1 ± 10.8 years of age. Mean time from Fontan operation to PLE diagnosis was 8.4 ± 14.2 years. Survival was 88% at 5 years. Decreased survival was seen in patients with high Fontan pressure (mean >15 mm Hg; p = 0.04), decreased ventricular function (ejection fraction <55%; p = 0.03), and New York Heart Association functional class >2 at diagnosis (p = 0.04). Patients who died had higher pulmonary vascular resistance (3.8 ± 1.6 Wood units [WU] vs. 2.1 ± 1.1 WU; p = 0.017), lower cardiac index (1.6 ± 0.4 l/min/m(2) vs. 2.7 ± 0.7 l/min/m(2); p < 0.0001), and lower mixed venous saturation (53% vs. 66%; p = 0.01), compared with survivors. Factors were assessed at the time of PLE diagnosis. Treatments used more frequently in survivors with PLE included spironolactone (21 [68%]), octreotide (7 [21%]), sildenafil (6 [19%]), fenestration creation (15 [48%]), and relief of Fontan obstruction (7 [23%]).PLE remains difficult to treat; however, in the current era, survival has improved with advances in treatment. Further study is needed to better understand the mechanism of disease and ideal treatment strategy.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Digestive System
