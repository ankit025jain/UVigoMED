{"id":52291,"title":"[Adrenocortical carcinoma: Update in 2014].","abstract":"All adrenal masses with atypical characteristics at conventional imaging must be explored as potential adrenocortical cancer. CT scan with delayed contrast media wash-out and/or abdominal MRI including chemical shift and/or wash-out analysis and 18F-FDG PET help to characterize the adrenal mass. Open adrenalectomy is the first step in the treatment of resectables adrenocortical cancer, as potentially curative. It must be complete (R0), without tumoral dissemination. The management of the adrenocortical cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach, including the endocrinologist, oncologist, surgeons, radiologist, nuclear medicine, pathologist, and geneticians in order to guarantee to the patient the best care. At the national level, the French network COMETE (supported by the Institut National du Cancer) and the international level, the European Network for the Study of Adrenal tumors -ENS@T- (supported by ESF and FP7) contribute to improve the clinical management and the understanding of the pathogenesis of the adrenocortical cancers. Recently, a new insight on molecular markers has been done. These approaches will be soon used \"in routine\".
