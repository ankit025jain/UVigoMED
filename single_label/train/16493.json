{"id":16493,"title":"Pityriasis versicolor: an update on pharmacological treatment options.","abstract":"Pityriasis versicolor (PV) is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia species; a yeast that naturally colonizes on the skins surface. High efficacy rates are generally obtained with both topical and systemic treatments. However, recurrence rates following successful treatment remain high and there are no dosage guidelines available for administration of systemic antifungal agents that carry risks of adverse events.This review focused on providing an overview of existing treatments for PV and an introduction to new treatments. A literature search was conducted using the search strategy, pityriasis versicolor OR tinea versicolor. Over the past decade, few new treatments have been introduced, but the efficacy and the dosing regimens of existing treatments have been systematically reviewed. The results of these reviews are discussed.Existing topical and systemic agents are both effective treatments against PV. Previous dosage recommendations for systemic agents have been modified based on recent evidence elucidated in systematic reviews. However, the absence of standardized collection and reporting practices in clinical trials precludes any conclusions to be drawn regarding the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic agents in comparison or in concert with each other.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991691","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Malassezia","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malassezia"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.451371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.336774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.279542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tinea versicolor","weight":0.236645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea_versicolor"},{"name":"Tinea","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Concert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Pityriasis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pityriasis"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Magna Graecia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Graecia"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
