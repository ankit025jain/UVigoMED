{"id":44115,"title":"Changes in liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients following different outcomes with peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy.","abstract":"There is scarce information about the impact of antiviral treatment on subsequent progression of liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C who experience different outcomes following peginterferon-ribavirin therapy. We conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with longitudinal assessment of liver fibrosis using elastometry. Patients were split out into four groups according to the prior peginterferon-ribavirin response: sustained virological response (SVR), relapse (R), partial response (PR) and null response (NR). A group of untreated, coinfected patients was taken as control. Significant liver fibrosis progression (sLFP) was defined as a shift from baseline Metavir estimates ? F2 to F3-F4, or by >30% increase in liver stiffness in patients with baseline F3-F4. Conversely, significant liver fibrosis regression (sLFR) was defined as a shift from baseline Metavir estimates F3-F4 to ? F2, or by >30% reduction in liver stiffness in patients that kept on F3-F4. A total of 498 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were examined. They were classified as follows: 138 (27.7%) SVR, 40 (8%) R, 61 (12.2%) PR, 71 (14.3%) NR and 188 (37.8%) naive. After a mean follow-up of 53.3 months, sLFP occurred less frequently in patients with SVR (7.2%) compared with R (25%; P = 0.002), PR (23%; P = 0.002), NR (29.6%; P < 0.001) and naïve (19.7%; P = 0.002). Conversely, sLFR was 26.1% in SVR compared with 10% in R (P = 0.03), 14.8% in PR (P = 0.06), 16.9% in NR (P = 0.07) and 10.6% in naïve (P < 0.001). Sustained clearance of serum HCV-RNA following a course of antiviral treatment is the major determinant of liver fibrosis regression in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750394","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.689713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.387767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fujita scale","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujita_scale"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Grumman F3F","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F3F"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
