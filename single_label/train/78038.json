{"id":78038,"title":"Improving the experience of pregnancy and childbirth for deaf people and their families.","abstract":"Deafness is unique in that it crosses barriers of age, gender, economic status and ethnicity. It is particularly complex in the context of the 'disabled/abled binary'. Generalisation is unhelpful since impairment is individualised and manifests itself in emotional, psychological, social and physical dimensions of a person's life. The 'Deaf Nest' project aims to improve deaf users' personal experience, equality of access, choice and control over maternity care. The implementation of clear guidance, an early assessment form, effective referrals, deaf awareness study days and 'Deaf Nest' support packs will result in improved deaf access to information, the ongoing assessment of need, improved health and lifestyle choices and greater family involvement.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804417","annotations":[{"name":"Social class","weight":0.828404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Social equality","weight":0.621562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_equality"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.585691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.535244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.249922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Generalization","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Dimensional analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Religious experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_experience"},{"name":"Information access","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_access"}]}
