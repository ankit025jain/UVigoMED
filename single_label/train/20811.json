{"id":20811,"title":"Comparative performance of urinary lipoarabinomannan assays and Xpert MTB/RIF in HIV-infected individuals.","abstract":"Xpert MTB/RIF ('Xpert') and urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assays offer rapid tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, but have suboptimal sensitivity when used individually in HIV-positive patients. The yield of these tests used in combination for the diagnosis of active TB among HIV-infected TB suspects is unknown.Study of comparative diagnostic accuracy nested into a prospective study of HIV-infected individuals with signs and/or symptoms of TB in Uganda.Xpert testing of archived sputum was conducted for culture-confirmed TB cases and TB suspects in whom a diagnosis of TB was excluded. Additional testing included sputum smear microscopy, sputum culture (solid and liquid media), mycobacterial blood culture, and urinary testing for LAM using a lateral flow test ('LF-LAM') and an enzyme-linked immunosorbance assay ('ELISA-LAM').Among 103 participants with culture-confirmed TB, sensitivity of Xpert was 76% (95% confidence interval, CI 0.66-0.84), and was superior to that of LF-LAM (49%, 95% CI 0.39-0.59, P < 0.001). Specificity was greater than 97% for both tests among 105 individuals without TB. The combination of smear microscopy and LF-LAM identified 67% (95% CI 0.57-0.76) of culture-confirmed TB cases and approached sensitivity of Xpert testing alone (P = 0.15). The sensitivity of the combination of Xpert and LF-LAM was 85% (88/103 95% CI 0.77-0.92), which was superior to either test alone (P < 0.05) and approached sensitivity of sputum liquid culture testing (94%, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, P = 0.17).Sputum Xpert and urinary LAM assays were complementary for the diagnosis of active TB in HIV-infected patients, and sensitivity of the combination of these tests was superior to that of either test alone.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637544","annotations":[{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.881616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.648069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Sputum culture","weight":0.635736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum_culture"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.492859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lateral flow test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_flow_test"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"570","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/570"},{"name":"880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/880"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
