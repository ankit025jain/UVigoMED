{"id":43646,"title":"Persistence of cognitive impairment after resolution of overt hepatic encephalopathy.","abstract":"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents a spectrum of neurocognitive impairment seen in cirrhotic patients and is considered to be fully reversible with treatment; however, recent evidence suggests otherwise. This longitudinal study was carried out to evaluate the persistence of cognitive impairment in cirrhotics with prior overt HE (OHE) episode despite treatment.Of the 213 patients screened, 107 patients who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled and 102 patients completed the study (52 patients without prior OHE episode and 50 patients with prior OHE). All patients underwent psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) evaluation at three separate visits (day 1, day 3, and between 30 and 60 days). A one-point improvement in PHES between the first and second evaluation was considered as a measure of learning.Patients with a previous OHE episode showed learning impairment in PHES on repetition on day 3 (P=0.084), whereas patients without a previous OHE episode demonstrated learning effect (P<0.0001) irrespective of whether they had minimal HE (MHE) or not. Univariate analysis demonstrated that Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, lactulose and/or rifaximin therapy, the presence of MHE, and a previous OHE episode were associated with learning impairment. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the presence of a previous episode of OHE (adjusted odds ratio 38.398; 95% confidence interval 9.192-160.4; P<0.0001) significantly affected learning.This study conclusively demonstrated learning impairment in cirrhotic patients with a previous episode of OHE despite normal mental status. Improvement in PHES on repetition may be a measure of learning.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777152","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.574423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.432491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.291953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.287187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.242983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatic encephalopathy","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.155323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mental status examination","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_status_examination"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Neurocognitive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocognitive"},{"name":"Lactulose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactulose"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Rifaximin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifaximin"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"398","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/398"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Thrust reversal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_reversal"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Rote learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"OHE","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OHE"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"}]}
