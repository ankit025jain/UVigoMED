{"id":56968,"title":"[The intensity of expression of matrix metalloproteinases type 2 and type 9 by invasive trophoblast cells in uncomplicated pregnancy and preeclampsia].","abstract":"To estimate the intensity of immunoexpression of matrix metalloproteinases type 2 and type 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) during cytotrophoblast invasion (CTI) in the uteroplacental region.There were 6 groups: 1) medical abortions at 7 to 8 weeks' gestation; 2) amputated uteri at 9 to 12 weeks; 3) late medical abortions at 18 to 24 weeks' gestation and amputated uteri at 25 weeks; 4) amputated uteri and biopsies of the placental bed, performed during cesarean section at 38-40 weeks. Two more groups included biopsies from women with preeclampsia: biopsy at 28-33 weeks (Group 5) and 34-38 weeks (Group 6). A total of 49 women were examined. An immunohistochemical method performed using the standard procedure revealed the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and cytokeratin in three invasive elements: interstitial cytotrophoblast (IC), multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), and intravascular cytotrophoblast (IVC).The expression of MMP-2 is intensive in all the invasive cells in the first and second trimesters and then decreases in IC and MGCs. The immunoexpression of MMP-9 with its minimal values in the first trimester successively increases in IVC and IC by a full-term gestation.MMP-2 hyperproduction in IVC and IC is of the greatest value for the first wave of CTI and high MMP-9 immunoexpression in all the invasive cells is more important for the second wave. In cases of preeclampsia, the least expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 is recorded in IC and MGCs in the complete absence of IVC.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306606","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Trophoblast","weight":0.89709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophoblast"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.816144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.700316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.385991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.290506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.256178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cytotrophoblast","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotrophoblast"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.0204144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Second-wave feminism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"CTI Records","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTI_Records"},{"name":"Group 5 (racing)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_(racing)"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Multinucleate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinucleate"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"}]}
