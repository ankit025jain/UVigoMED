{"id":78442,"title":"Round window reinforcement for superior semicircular canal dehiscence: a retrospective multi-center case series.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome of round window (RW) tissue reinforcement in the management of superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD).Twenty-two patients with confirmed diagnosis of SSCD by clinical presentation, imaging, and/or testing were included in the study. Six surgeons at four institutions conducted a multicenter chart review of patients treated for symptomatic superior canal dehiscence using RW tissue reinforcement or complete RW occlusion. A transcanal approach was used to reinforce the RW with various types of tissue. Patients completed a novel postoperative survey, grading preoperative and postoperative symptom severity.Analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in all symptoms with the exception of hearing loss in 19 patients who underwent RW reinforcement. In contrast, 2 of 3 participants who underwent the alternate treatment of RW niche occlusion experienced worsened symptoms requiring revision surgery.RW tissue reinforcement may reduce the symptoms associated with SSCD. The reinforcement technique may benefit SSCD patients by reducing the \"third window\" effect created by a dehiscent semicircular canal. Given its low risks compared to middle cranial fossa or transmastoid canal occlusion, RW reinforcement may prove to be a suitable initial procedure for intractable SSCD. In contrast, complete RW occlusion is not advised.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667055","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.731501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.359626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"},{"name":"Superior semicircular canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Middle cranial fossa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"Semicircular canal","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Superior canal dehiscence","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_canal_dehiscence"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Round window","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_window"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Historical revisionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"}]}
