{"id":63362,"title":"Brief report: Loss of p15Ink4b accelerates development of myeloid neoplasms in Nup98-HoxD13 transgenic mice.","abstract":"Homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is a tightly regulated process. The disturbance of the balance in the hematopoietic progenitor pool can result in favorable conditions for development of diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia. It has been shown recently that mice lacking p15Ink4b have skewed differentiation of common myeloid progenitors toward the myeloid lineage at the expense of erythroid progenitors. The lack of p15INK4B expression in human leukemic blasts has been linked to poor prognosis and increased risk of myelodysplastic syndromes transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. However, the role of p15Ink4b in disease development is just beginning to be elucidated. This study examines the collaboration of the loss of p15Ink4b with Nup98-HoxD13 translocation in the development of hematological malignancies in a mouse model. Here, we report that loss of p15Ink4b collaborates with Nup98-HoxD13 transgene in the development of predominantly myeloid neoplasms, namely acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative disease, and myelodysplastic syndromes. This mouse model could be a very valuable tool for studying p15Ink4b function in tumorigenesis as well as preclinical drug testing.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449168","annotations":[{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.69692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.608539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.554797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.517862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.325719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.319367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Myeloproliferative disease","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_disease"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.127966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.109096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Plant physiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_physiology"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
