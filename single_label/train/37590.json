{"id":37590,"title":"Three-dimensional brain surface visualization for epilepsy surgery of focal cortical dysplasia.","abstract":"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) causes medically intractable seizures in 5-10% of adult epilepsy patients, but patients can become seizure free through surgical resection. The authors present the utility of three-dimensional surface visualization (3DSV) that expands on existing imaging datasets to highlight surface vasculature as a tool for achieving more successful resections in patients with FCD. In this prospective series of six patients, preoperative 3DSV was performed for planning the surgical approach to the lesion and for intraoperative guidance. Reconstructions involved volume rendering of a contrast-enhanced dataset to visualize surface venous vasculature. Postoperatively, five of the six patients had complete resections, with one patient having a subtotal resection due to proximity to crucial vasculature. We report that 3DSV is a useful tool for surgical planning, since topographical relationships between lesion location and surface vasculature landmarks are less likely to change with surgical progress.
