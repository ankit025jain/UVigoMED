{"id":42626,"title":"Does magnifying narrow-band imaging or magnifying chromoendoscopy help experienced endoscopists assess invasion depth of large sessile and flat polyps?","abstract":"Distinguishing deep submucosa (SM) from superficial SM cancer in large sessile and flat colorectal polyps (>2 cm) is crucial in making the most appropriate therapeutic decision. We evaluated the additional role of magnifying narrow-band imaging (NBI) and magnifying chromoendoscopy (MCE) in assessing the depth of invasion in large sessile and flat polyps in comparison to morphological evaluation performed by experienced endoscopists.From May 2011 to December 2011, a total of 85 large sessile and flat polyps were analyzed. Endoscopic features of the polyps were independently evaluated by experienced endoscopists. Subsequently, the polyps were observed using magnifying NBI and MCE.A total of 58 intramucosal lesions and 27 SM cancers (five superficial and 22 deep) were identified. The diagnostic accuracy of the experienced endoscopists, NBI, and MCE were 92.9, 90.6, and 89.4 %, respectively, for deep SM cancer. In combination with NBI or MCE, the diagnostic accuracy of the experienced endoscopists did not change significantly for deep SM cancer, with an accuracy of 95.3 % for both NBI and MCE.Conventional colonoscopy can differentiate superficial from deep SM cancers with an accuracy of as high as 92.9 % in large sessile and flat polyps. Further diagnostic strategies are required in order to precisely assess the depth of invasion, especially in large colorectal polyps.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839918","annotations":[{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.828352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.748578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.603844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Narrowband","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband"},{"name":"Sessility (zoology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessility_(zoology)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Magnification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"},{"name":"92.9 (Perth radio station)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/92.9_(Perth_radio_station)"}]}
