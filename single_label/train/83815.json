{"id":83815,"title":"Burden of arthritis in Delaware: implications for public health.","abstract":"Delaware's older population is increasing at a faster rate than in most other states. The number of adults with arthritis is expected to increase sharply in the coming years, thus making it important to explore the burden of this leading cause of disability at the state and local level. This study explored the burden of arthritis in Delaware along with its co-morbidity with other chronic conditions..Data from 4,777 adults in Delaware who participated in the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to quantify the self-reported burden of arthritis. As a secondary analysis we explored prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes among adults with arthritis.In 2011, 26.30 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.67-27.94) of Delaware residents reported a diagnosis of arthritis. Delawareans 65 years and over had more than six times higher odds of diagnosed arthritis. Logistic regression model showed higher odds for sex, income, smoking, and obesity. Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were three times higher in adults with arthritis. Burden of arthritis was evident with 45 percent experiencing activity limitations and 34 percent reporting arthritis affected their employment.Arthritis-related societal burden will increase substantially over the coming years in Delaware. Worksite accommodation will become a greater issue as the number of working-age people with arthritis increases. Enhancing clinic-community linkages is recommended. Co-morbidity of chronic conditions may be effectively managed through interventions that focus on multiple conditions.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244724","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.831328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.785866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.640807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.483288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.475208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_Risk_Factor_Surveillance_System"},{"name":"Delaware","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
