{"id":23779,"title":"Diagnostic performance of FDG PET or PET/CT in prosthetic infection after arthroplasty: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of published data regarding the diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) in prosthetic infection after arthroplasty.A comprehensive computer literature search of studies published through May 31, 2012 regarding PET or PET/CT in patients suspicious of prosthetic infection was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET or PET/CT in patients suspicious of prosthetic infection on a per prosthesis-based analysis were calculated. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to measure the accuracy of PET or PET/CT in patients with suspicious of prosthetic infection.Fourteen studies comprising 838 prosthesis with suspicious of prosthetic infection after arthroplasty were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of PET or PET/CT in detecting prosthetic infection was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82-90%) on a per prosthesis-based analysis. The pooled specificity of PET or PET/CT in detecting prosthetic infection was 86% (95% CI 83-89%) on a per prosthesis-based analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.93 on a per prosthesis-based analysis.In patients suspicious of prosthetic infection, FDG PET or PET/CT demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. FDG PET or PET/CT are accurate methods in this setting. Nevertheless, possible sources of false positive results and influcing factors should kept in mind.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469570","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.920421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.788465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.704034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.36382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.254061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"May 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_31"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"838","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/838"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
