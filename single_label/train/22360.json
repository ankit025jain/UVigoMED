{"id":22360,"title":"Benzimidazole-based compounds kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abstract":"Tuberculosis remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases, killing 1.4 million people annually and showing a rapid increase in cases resistant to multiple drugs. New antibiotics against tuberculosis are urgently needed. Here we describe the design, synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a series of benzimidazole-based compounds with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in a replicating state, a physiologically-induced non-replicating state, or both. Compounds 49, 67, 68, 69, 70, and 72, which shared a 5-nitrofuranyl moiety, exhibited high potency and acceptable selectivity indices (SI). As illustrated by compound 70 (MIC90 < 0.049 ?g/mL, SI > 512), the 5-nitrofuranyl group was compatible with minimal cytotoxicity and good intra-macrophage killing, although it lacked non-replicating activity when assessed by CFU assays. Compound 70 had low mutagenic potential by SOS Chromotest assay, making this class of compounds good candidates for further evaluation and target identification.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556148","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.69525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.620859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.59363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.587055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Mutagen","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Caribbean Football Union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Football_Union"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"},{"name":"SOS","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
