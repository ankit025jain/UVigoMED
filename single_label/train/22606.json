{"id":22606,"title":"Design, synthesis and antitubercular evaluation of novel series of N-[4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl]cinnamamide derivatives.","abstract":"The analogs of N-[4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl]cinnamamide were designed and synthesized by molecular hybridization approach in which part C of the designed molecule was linked through amide and carbamate functionality that improves the physicochemical properties and govern the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior. The systematic modification was done around the Part C to explore the structure activity relationship of antitubercular cinnamamide. All 52 compounds were evaluated for its antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) using Resazurin microtitre plate assay (REMA). Compound 11 g with trifluoromethyl substitution exhibited good antitubercular activity of 3.125 ?g/ml. The synthesized N-[4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl]cinnamamide derivatives showed promising activity against M. tb.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530490","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Amide","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Structure-activity relationship","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure-activity_relationship"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.627831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.604628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.470048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.146605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Carbamate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamate"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Resazurin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resazurin"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Trifluoromethyl","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoromethyl"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
