{"id":36162,"title":"[Planning delivery in cases of congenital malformations from the neonatologist's point of view].","abstract":"Nowadays, most major congenital malformations are detected by prenatal ultrasound long before birth. This offers the opportunity to plan and organise the birth of such a baby in the most favourable setting. This paper gives an overview about how to decide on place, timing, and mode of delivery in some typical congenital malformations from the neonatologist's point of view. As, in most cases scientific evidence is lacking, there is an urgent need for prospective clinical trials. The question concerning the best place of birth is answered in a national guideline, which has been consented by several scientific societies. In this guideline, the transfer of the pregnant woman to a high level perinatal centre is recommended in the case of a known foetal malformation. Delivery outside a perinatal centre has been shown to increase mortality in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and complications in infants born with gastroschisis. With respect to the timing of the delivery, the risks of an iatrogenic preterm birth must be considered in relation to the potential benefit for the newborn baby. There seems to be some advantage of a birth before the regular date only in few malformations. In most cases of congenital malformation, only a Caesarean section has a remarkable advantage with respect to the organisation of the delivery room management, but has no medical necessity for the baby. In summary, the delivery of a baby with a congenital malformation should be planned and organised by an interdisciplinary team of prenatal and postnatal specialists in close contact and consent with the parents.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595912","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.818834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Obstetric ultrasonography","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.60708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_diaphragmatic_hernia"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.254291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.244869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.218851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Gastroschisis","weight":0.199317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroschisis"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.150237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Place of birth","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_birth"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
