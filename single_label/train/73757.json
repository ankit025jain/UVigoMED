{"id":73757,"title":"[Quality criteria in radiotherapy for head and neck cancers under the aegis of Head and Neck Intergroup].","abstract":"The aim of radiotherapy is to deliver enough radiation to the tumor in order to achieve maximum tumour control in the irradiated volume with as few serious complications as possible with an irradiation dose as low as possible to normal tissue. The quality of radiotherapy is essential for optimal treatment and quality control is to reduce the bias in clinical trials avoiding possible major deviations. The assurance and quality control programs have been developed in large european (EORTC, GORTEC) and american cooperative groups (RTOG) of radiation oncology since the 1980s. We insist here on the importance of quality assurance in radiotherapy and the current status in this domain and the criteria for quality control especially for current clinical trials within GORTEC are discussed here.
