{"id":86175,"title":"Improving quality of care and guideline adherence for asthma through a group self-assessment module.","abstract":"The quality of care for asthma remains suboptimal. Compliance with guidelines remains low, but improved adherence to guidelines may increase the quality of care. but. We conducted a trial to determine whether group Self-Assessment Module (SAM) activities led by a facilitator and conducted as part of Maintenance of Certification for Family Physicians (MC-FP) would increase knowledge of and adherence to asthma guidelines.Participating physicians completed audits of the charts of patients with asthma before and 6 months after a group SAM. Surveys of physicians' knowledge of asthma guidelines were administered immediately before, immediately after, and 6 months after the group SAM. We tested for differences in knowledge of and adherence to guidelines before and after the SAM using ?(2) and t tests.Thirty-eight physicians in Virginia completed the SAM and had complete data. Participants completed more MC-FP activities than other physicians but were comparable in other characteristics. Except for prescribing controller medications for persistent asthma, all other quality measures significantly improved 6 months after the group SAM. Diagnosis by severity improved from 48.3% to 80.2%, and the use of action plans increased from 8.1% to 54.1%. Physicians' knowledge of guidelines improved immediately after the SAM and was sustained at 6 months. Increased knowledge translated into clinical skills: 30% of participants reported comfort with assessing control after the SAM, which increased to 97.5% 6 months after the SAM.Group SAMs may be an effective method to increase physicians' knowledge of and adherence to clinical guidelines.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808118","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.560235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.310685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.233225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.145004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Family medicine","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Chart","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart"},{"name":"Maintenance of Certification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_of_Certification"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surface-to-air missile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile"},{"name":"Air traffic controller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Module (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Facilitator","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitator"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
