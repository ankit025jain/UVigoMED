{"id":45255,"title":"Bevacizumab improves splenomegaly and decreases production of hyaluronic acid after L-OHP based chemotherapy.","abstract":"Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy can cause hepatic sinusoidal injury such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS). Spleen size is correlated with sinusoidal damage, and serum hyaluronic acid is also a marker of SOS. The aim of the present study was to clarify the impact of the current chemotherapeutic regimen plus bevacizumab against oxaliplatin-associated hepatic damage with serum hyaluronic acid and spleen size.Sixteen adult patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastasis were evaluated retrospectively. In the bevacizumab-treated group (n=9), oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab prior to hepatic resection was administered, while oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy-alone was administered prior to hepatic resection in the control group (n=7). Hepatic sinusoidal injury, change in spleen size and serum value of hyaluronic acid were evaluated.The incidence and severity of sinusoidal dilation was lower in the bevacizumab group than in the control group (moderate or severe: 2/9 (22.2%) vs. 5/7 (71.4%), incidence of sinusoidal dialation: 5/9 (55.6%) vs. 7/7 (100%), both p<0.05). The change in spleen size and serum hyaluronic acid were significantly lower in the bevacizumab-treated group compared to the control group (change in spleen size: 110.3%±27.5% vs. 146.3%±34.2%, hyaluronic acid: 33.6±21.2 ng/ml vs. 124.5±34.0 ng/ml, both p<0.05).In the current study, bevacizumab reduced SOS in pathological findings and suppressed the elevation of hyaluronic acid, and splenomegaly. In addition, a change in spleen size and serum hyaluronic acid could serve as a biomarker for a predictive effect of bevacizumab against SOS.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692731","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.752451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.693244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.424987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.374684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.321274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0416485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Sinusoid (blood vessel)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoid_(blood_vessel)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"534","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/534"},{"name":"Filmmaking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"SOS","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS"}]}
