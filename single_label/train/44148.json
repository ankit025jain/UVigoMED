{"id":44148,"title":"Advances in diagnostic endoscopy for duodenal, including ampullary, adenoma.","abstract":"Currently, the strategy for real-time endoscopic diagnosis of duodenal, including ampullary, adenoma is still unclear. In the era of high-definition and magnification endoscopy, using this modality for the detection and diagnosis of these neoplasms is very challenging for endoscopists. Over the past 10 years, many instruments have been developed to improve the detection rate of duodenal and ampullary polyps and to distinguish between adenoma and non-adenoma. The present review will focus on these novel methods and their usefulness in the diagnosis of ampullary and non-ampullary adenoma.
