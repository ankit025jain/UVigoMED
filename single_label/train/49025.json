{"id":49025,"title":"Transient hypothyroidism induced by anticonvulsant agents.","abstract":"The question whether antiepileptic drugs alter thyroid function requires a better understanding. In our article, we report two sisters, one of whom was treated with levothyroxine because of hypothyroidism. Although both women received anticonvulsant therapy, transient hypothyroidism was observed only in the hypothyroid woman and was found after treatment with classic anticonvulsant agents (carbamazepine and sodium valproate) but not with gabapentin. Our report shows that the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on the thyroid gland depends on the patient's hormonal status and on the drug being used.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977965","annotations":[{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Gabapentin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Sodium valproate","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_valproate"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Valproic acid","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Levothyroxine","weight":0.774952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Thyroid function tests","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_function_tests"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"}]}
