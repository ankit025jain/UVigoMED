{"id":84314,"title":"The effects of depression and chronic diseases on the work outcomes of employees: a prospective study in Northwest China.","abstract":"A prospective cohort study was conducted to examine the impact of physical and mental health status on the job loss and job turnover rates in Northwestern China. There were 1778 employees included in the baseline survey at April 2006 and were followed-up in October 2006. They were classified into four groups: those with chronic diseases (n = 205), depression (n = 273), both chronic diseases and depression (n = 96), and a control group (n = 1204). Logistic regression was used to examine the impact of depression and chronic diseases on employment between the baseline and the 6-month follow-up interviews. The results of the analyses showed that participants suffering from depression were more likely to be unemployed (OR, 1.44; P < 0.05), recently changed jobs (OR, 3.28, P < 0.001) and earning a lower salary (B = -135.28RMB, P < 0.001). Depression accompanying chronic diseases had an increased risk of unemployment (OR, 2.05; P < 0.01). The participants with chronic diseases were more likely to change their jobs (OR, 2.53; P < 0.05), but this had no significant impact on unemployment and monthly salary. Overall, the findings suggest that people with depression were at a higher risk of unemployment and job turnover than people with chronic disease.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132392","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.645269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.638079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.39222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Turnover (employment)","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(employment)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.121183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Salary","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Northwestern University","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University"},{"name":"Renminbi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi"},{"name":"Northwest China","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_China"},{"name":"Xinjiang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1204","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1204"},{"name":"1778","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1778"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Baseline (surveying)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(surveying)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Northwestern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"}]}
