{"id":65819,"title":"[The use of vitaprost in the treatment of patients with prostate diseases].","abstract":"Inflammatory diseases of the prostate are common among men. These diseases are frequently characterized by long-term course and relapses. Prostatitis-associated symptoms significantly reduce the quality of life of patients. Due to the lack of generally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of prostatitis, the frequency of inflammatory diseases of the prostate is difficult to establish. Inflammatory diseases of the prostate should be differentiated from chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The mainstay of treatment of infectious and inflammatory processes in the prostate are antibacterial drugs (generations III and IV fluoroquinolones). The recommended course of treatment includes 4-6 weeks. Prostate peptides from bovine (cytomedines) have proven efficacy in the treatment of patients with prostatitis; cytomedines influence the differentiation and proliferation of prostate cells, have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. In clinical trials, high efficiency of cytomedines in prostatitis and prostate adenoma, as well as long-term remission of the diseases is demonstrated.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772777","annotations":[{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.485245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.343591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_prostatitis/chronic_pelvic_pain_syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
