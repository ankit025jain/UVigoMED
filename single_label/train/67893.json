{"id":67893,"title":"Penile rehabilitation: the evolutionary concept in the management of erectile dysfunction.","abstract":"A compromise in erectile function is commonly experienced after radical prostatectomy and has been attributed to injury to vascular, neurogenic, and smooth muscle. The concept of rehabilitation after organ injury is not a novel concept and is one that has been applied to all aspects of medicine. Penile rehabilitation has been classically defined as the use of a device or pharmacologic agent to aid erectile function recovery after radical prostatectomy. Here we redefine penile rehabilitation as the use of any device, medication, or intervention to promote male sexual function as a primer before and after any insult to the penile erectile physiologic axis. We also review the epidemiology, rational and current literature on penile rehabilitation after prostatectomy.
