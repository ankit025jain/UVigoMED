{"id":56431,"title":"ABCA1 rs1883025 polymorphism shows no association with neovascular age-related macular degeneration or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in a Northern Chinese population.","abstract":"To analyze the association between ABCA1 rs1883025 variants with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in a northern Chinese population.The study enrolled 900 subjects, including 300 controls, 300 cases with nAMD and 300 cases with PCV. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCA1 (rs1883025) gene were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.The ABCA1 rs1883025 polymorphism was not significantly associated with nAMD (22.5%; p > 0.05) or PCV (20.8%; p > 0.05) in a northern Chinese population. The association remained insignificant after adjustment for age and gender differences (p > 0.05).This study suggests that ABCA1 rs1883025 variants are not associated with nAMD or PCV in a Chinese population, which is likely due to an ethnic difference.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685762","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.621736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.610813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"China","weight":0.332313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.29127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.253154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"ABCA1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCA1"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Mandarin Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"American Baseball Coaches Association","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Baseball_Coaches_Association"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Gender role","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Northern and southern China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
