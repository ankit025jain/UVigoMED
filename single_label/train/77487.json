{"id":77487,"title":"Genetic variants in the major histocompatibility complex class I and class II genes are associated with diisocyanate-induced Asthma.","abstract":"To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located across the major histocompatibility complex and susceptibility to diisocyanate-induced asthma (DA).The study population consisted of 140 diisocyanate-exposed workers. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate major histocompatibility complex panels.The HLA-E rs1573294 and HLA-DPB1 rs928976 SNPs were associated with an increased risk of DA under dominant (odds ratio [OR], 6.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.37 to 16.6; OR, 2.79, 95% CI, 0.99 to 7.81, respectively) and recessive genetic models (OR, 6.27, 95% CI, 1.63 to 24.13; OR, 10.10, 95% CI, 3.16 to 32.33, respectively). The HLA-B rs1811197, HLA-DOA rs3128935, and HLA-DQA2 rs7773955 SNPs conferred an increased risk of DA in a dominant model (OR, 7.64, 95% CI, 2.25 to 26.00; OR, 19.69, 95% CI, 2.89 to 135.25; OR, 8.43, 95% CI, 3.03 to 23.48, respectively).These results suggest that genetic variations within HLA genes play a role in DA risk.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709764","annotations":[{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.770988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.726497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.689497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Illumina (company)","weight":0.39111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_(company)"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.296898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.246925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.236206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
