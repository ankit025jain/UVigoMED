{"id":37298,"title":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for a failed bio-bentall in patients with Marfan syndrome.","abstract":"Patients with Marfan syndrome are at risk for ascending aortic dilation and dissection at the level of the aortic sinuses, making aortic root and valve replacement common. Patients undergoing an aortic root replacement with concomitant replacement of the aortic valve with a bioprosthesis (Bio-Bentall) are predisposed to bioprosthesis failure. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an option for aortic valve replacement, avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and/or median sternotomy. We present the first 2 reported patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent a valve-in-valve TAVI in the setting of a prior Bio-Bentall.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504220","annotations":[{"name":"Marfan syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.877136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.77955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.727753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aortic sinus","weight":0.486601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_sinus"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.117418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"}]}
