{"id":56234,"title":"Neuro-ophthalmic effects of stenting across the ophthalmic artery origin in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.","abstract":"OBJECT.: The benefits of treating intracranial aneurysms in the region of the anterior visual pathways are well understood. However, the adverse effects of endovascular stenting across the ophthalmic artery have received little attention. The authors reviewed their experience with patients who had stents deployed across the ophthalmic artery origin.Patients' medical charts and imaging studies were reviewed to identify all patients with a non-flow diverting stent deployed over the ophthalmic artery origin for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. All patients with neuro-ophthalmic complaints were referred for formal ophthalmological evaluation.A total of 104 consecutive patients with 106 aneurysms were identified to meet criteria for inclusion in the study cohort. Preoperatively, 30 patients (29%) described headache symptoms and 32 patients (31%) reported visual complaints. Of the patients with preoperative headaches, 15 (54%) of 28 patients for whom follow-up was available experienced improvement in their symptoms. Of the patients with preoperative visual complaints, improvement was noted in 11 (41%) of the 27 patients for whom follow-up was available, 9 (33%) of 27 patients reported no change in visual symptoms, and 7 (26%) of 27 patients reported progression of symptoms. Visual field defects developing posttreatment were noted to occur in 8 (7.7%) of 104 patients: 3 with immediate postoperative retinal infarcts, 1 with perioperative hemianopia that resolved by the time of discharge, 1 with a subjective visual field defect, 1 with subjective migratory visual field defects, and 2 with nonspecific visual symptoms. Compressive symptoms from aneurysm mass effect were noted in 6 patients preoperatively, with 4 of those patients experiencing persistent worsening, resolution in 1 case, and no change in 1 case. One patient developed a novel cranial nerve palsy from mass effect in the immediate postoperative period.Deployment of stents across the ophthalmic artery origin for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms appears to be relatively safe with regard to visual outcomes. Neuro-ophthalmic complaint resolution rates were comparable to endovascular procedures that do not employ stents, with headache resolution rates comparable to coil-only aneurysm obliteration and low rates of retinal ischemic events. For patients presenting with mass effect, stent-assisted coiling appears to be less effective than microsurgery with decompression for relief of compressive symptoms.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724858","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.772813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.760045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Cranial nerve","weight":0.735611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerve"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.540761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Ophthalmic artery","weight":0.341938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmic_artery"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.244566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.243717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.123264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Guglielmi Detachable Coil","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmi_Detachable_Coil"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Mass effect (medicine)","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_effect_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemianopsia","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemianopsia"}]}
