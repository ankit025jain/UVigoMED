{"id":245,"title":"Sertraline influence on morphine-induced conditioned place preference in rats.","abstract":"Serotonine reuptake inhibitors are an important pharmacological arsenal for treating major depression, a severe disease with poorly understood pathogenic mechanisms. Also, little is known about the action of antidepressants on reward system, the function of which is severely affected in this disorder.To assess the influence of sertraline on brain reward system by conditioned place preference technique in rats.Both 3 and 5 mg/kg doses of sertraline determined a significant rewarding effect, whereas only the 5 mg/kg dose increased the morphine-induced rewarding effect (in the morphine-only group time spent in the conditioning chamber increased by 184.92 +/- 21.43% post-conditioning vs. preconditioning, whereas the increase was 195.56 +/- 18.3% in the group treated with morphine and sertraline 5 mg/kg, p < 0.05).The stimulant effect of sertraline on brain reward function might be involved in its therapeutic efficacy.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341290","annotations":[{"name":"Sertraline","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.674364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.598877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.559834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.350407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Reinforcement learning","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
