{"id":36554,"title":"Supraventricular tachycardia precipitated by a peripherally inserted central catheter in an infant with gastroschisis.","abstract":"Gastroschisis is a common congenital abdominal wall defect requiring surgical correction in early neonatal life. The time to full enteral feeds among infants with gastroschisis is variable. Gastroschisis remains a common surgical cause of intestinal failure in neonates. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are commonly used to provide long-term venous access for parenteral nutrition during the time enteral feeds are being slowly established. The PICC is placed under fluoroscopic guidance with the distal end of the catheter usually placed at the junction of the superior vena cava with the right atrium. In rare circumstances, the catheter tip may advance into intracardiac chambers, precipitating supraventricular re-entrant tachycardia. We report a case of an infant who was antenatally diagnosed with uncomplicated gastroschisis in whom a supraventricular tachycardia was precipitated by the PICC in the right atrium.
