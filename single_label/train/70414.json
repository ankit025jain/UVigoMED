{"id":70414,"title":"Dose rate in brachytherapy using after-loading machine: pulsed or high-dose rate?","abstract":"Since February 2014, it is no longer possible to use low-dose rate 192 iridium wires due to the end of industrial production of IRF1 and IRF2 sources. The Brachytherapy Group of the French society of radiation oncology (GC-SFRO) has recommended switching from iridium wires to after-loading machines. Two types of after-loading machines are currently available, based on the dose rate used: pulsed-dose rate or high-dose rate. In this article, we propose a comparative analysis between pulsed-dose rate and high-dose rate brachytherapy, based on biological, technological, organizational and financial considerations.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195117","annotations":[{"name":"Industry","weight":0.828582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.677426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Iridium","weight":0.542693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"France","weight":0.28141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.0441596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"IRF2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF2"},{"name":"IRF1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF1"},{"name":"French people","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"2014 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"Interferon regulatory factors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_regulatory_factors"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Industrial production","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_production"}]}
