{"id":53148,"title":"Association between haptoglobin 2-2 genotype and coronary artery disease and its severity in a tunisian population.","abstract":"Haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism generates three common human genotypes (Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2), having functional differences, related to the risk of development of cardiovascular diseases. These functions are a consequence of hemoglobin binding that leads to the synthesis of an antioxidant like ferritin. We explored the association of Hp polymorphism with significant coronary stenosis (SCS) and its severity within 400 Tunisian patients, using genotyping, biochemical parameters, and the Gensini score. After adjustments for age and gender, Hp2-2 was associated with the highest ferritin but the lowest Hp concentrations. After adjustments for confounding parameters, the OR of SCS associated with Hp2-2 was 1.74 (95% CI 1.18-2.58; p = 0.005). This effect was enhanced within diabetics (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.11-3.24; p = 0.018), obese subjects (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.10-4.86; p = 0.034), and smokers (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.54-1.29; p = 0.005). The Hp2-2 genotype is associated with an increase in SCS especially in diabetics, the obese, and smokers.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535155","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.761851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.742865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.701531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.686037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.458563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Haptoglobin","weight":0.451707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptoglobin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Tunisia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
