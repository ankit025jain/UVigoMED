{"id":71546,"title":"Binding of tissue-type plasminogen activator to the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) modulates plasminogen activation and promotes human neuroblastoma cell proliferation in vitro.","abstract":"The glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a plasminogen (Pg) receptor on the cell surface. In this study, we demonstrate that GRP78 also binds the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which results in a decrease in K(m) and an increase in the V(max) for both its amidolytic activity and activation of its substrate, Pg. This results in accelerated Pg activation when GRP78, t-PA, and Pg are bound together. The increase in t-PA activity is the result of a mechanism involving a t-PA lysine-dependent binding site in the GRP78 amino acid sequence (98)LIGRTWNDPSVQQDIKFL(115). We found that GRP78 is expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells where it is co-localized with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which is also a t-PA-binding protein in these cells. We demonstrate that both Pg and t-PA serve as a bridge between GRP78 and VDAC bringing them together to facilitate Pg activation. t-PA induces SK-N-SH cell proliferation via binding to GRP78 on the cell surface. Furthermore, Pg binding to the COOH-terminal region of GRP78 stimulates cell proliferation via its microplasminogen domain. This study confirms previous findings from our laboratory showing that GRP78 acts as a growth factor-like receptor and that its association with t-PA, Pg, and VDAC on the cell surface may be part of a system controlling cell growth.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059665","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.750661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.725454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Anion","weight":0.659758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.587498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.560355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.509539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.42572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.252321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.161784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Michaelis-Menten kinetics","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis-Menten_kinetics"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"}]}
