{"id":69117,"title":"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose--positron emission tomography/computed tomography aids staging and predicts mortality in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","abstract":"To investigate the association between extravesical (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesions on FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and mortality in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.An international, bi-institutional cohort study of 211 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who underwent staging CT and FDG-PET/CT imaging. On the basis of the presence of extravesical FDG-avid lesions suspicious for malignancy on PET/CT images, patients were divided into a PET/CT-positive and PET/CT-negative group. Data on staging and mortality were retrospectively analyzed from prospective databases. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to compare overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between the groups. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to investigate the association between extravesical PET/CT lesions and mortality. Extravesical lesions suspicious for malignancy on conventional CT were included in the models.Of the 211 patients, 98 (46.4%) had 1 or more extravesical lesions on PET/CT, 113 (53.5%) had a negative PET/CT. Conventional CT revealed extravesical lesions in 51 patients (24.4%). Median follow-up was 18 months. Patients with a positive PET/CT had a significantly shorter OS and DSS (median OS: 14 vs 50 months, P = .001; DSS: 16 vs 50 months, P <.001). In multivariable analysis, the presence of extravesical lesions on PET/CT was an independent prognostic indicator of mortality (OS: hazard ratio = 3.0, confidence interval 95% 1.7-5.1). This association was not statistically significant for conventional CT (hazard ratio = 1.6 (95% confidence interval 0.9-2.7).On the basis of our results, the presence of extravesical FDG-avid lesions on PET/CT might be considered an independent indicator of mortality.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468513","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.870774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.670054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.607875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.583299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.516473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.45643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.365993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.303665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.297784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Exhaust gas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Dummy variable (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
