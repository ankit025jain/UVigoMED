{"id":70878,"title":"[Transplantation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells combined with haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells for 36 patients with refractory/relapsed myeloid leukemia].","abstract":"This study was purposed to analyse the clinical efficacy of transplantation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) combined with haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (haplo-HSCT) for patients with refractory/relapsed myeloid leukemia. The clinical data of 36 patients received transplantation of UC-MSC combined with haplo-HSCT from January 2007 to June 2013 were summarized retrospectively, the engraftment, GVHD and 2 years-overall survival (OS) were analysed. The results showed that the median times of neutrophil count>0.50×10(9)/L and platelet count>20×10(9)/L were 12.0 days and 14.0 days, respectively. Grade III to IV aGVHD occurred in 5 out of 36 patients (13.8%). cGVHD occurred in 12 out of 32 patients (37.5%) and extensive cGVHD occurred in 2 patients. Additionally, only 3 patients (8.3%) experienced relapse. The 2-year OS rate of patients was 76.9%. It is concluded that the transplantation of UC-MSC combined with haplo-HSCT has good therapeutic efficacy for patients with refractory/relapsed myeloid leukemia, and may be served as a therapeutic method especially for patients with high risk and without well matched donor.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130827","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.732753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
