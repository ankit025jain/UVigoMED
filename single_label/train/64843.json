{"id":64843,"title":"[Experience of the use of drug urorec: efficacy and safety].","abstract":"The article presents the experience of use of the new superselective alpha-blocker urorec (silodosin) in the treatment of 30 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms aged 49 to 69 years. Patients have received silodosin 1 capsule a day for 2 months. According to the results of study, silodosin has demonstrated high efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. It was shown that silodosin does not increase the risk of hypotension in patients taking antihypertensive medications. Therapy with silodosin had positive and statistically significant impact on subjective and objective symptoms of the disease, which was confirmed by the IPSS-QoL score and uroflowmetry. Silodosin has rapid onset of effect (3-4 days after the start of treatment); it can be used in all patients suffering from BPH and having indications to the administration of alpha-blockers, and does not require correction of doses of antihypertensive drugs in the case of combined appointment.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211926","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.782658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.690492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.643183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.614441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.223677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Silodosin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silodosin"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
