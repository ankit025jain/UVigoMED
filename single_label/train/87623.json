{"id":87623,"title":"Mandatory health care insurance is associated with shorter hospital length of stay among critically injured trauma patients.","abstract":"The implementation of the Affordable Care Act stimulated interest in outcomes of patients in Massachusetts, a state mandating health insurance as of 2006. We sought to determine the impact of an insurance mandate on hospital use and outcomes among trauma intensive care unit (ICU) patients.This is a retrospective cohort study of trauma patients admitted to the ICU conducted at an academic, trauma center. Patients before (2004-2006) and after (2008-2012) the implementation of mandatory health insurance were compared using propensity matching to control for confounders. Outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, in-hospital mortality, and discharge disposition.Overall, 1,668 trauma patients were included, with 530 matched on the propensity score in each group. Hospital LOS decreased by a median of 2.0 days, from 9.0 days (interquartile range, 4-15 days; p < 0.01) before to 7.0 days (interquartile range, 4-14) after implementation of the legislation. There were no differences in ICU LOS (3.0 days to 3.0 days, p = 0.44) and mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.63). Compared with discharges to home, the patients were more likely to be discharged home with home health services after the legislation (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.08-2.68), but there was no significant change in the likelihoods of the patients being discharged to skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.72-1.31).Implementation of health care reform was associated with a decrease in hospital LOS, with an increase in use of home health services and no change in ICU LOS and mortality among trauma ICU patients at our institution.Prognostic/epidemiologic study, level III.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25058257","annotations":[{"name":"Health
