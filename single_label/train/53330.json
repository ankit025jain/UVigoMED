{"id":53330,"title":"Clinical value of tapentadol extended-release in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.","abstract":"Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is difficult to treat, partially because the underlying mechanism of pain is not fully understood. Various treatment guidelines recommend first-line agents, such as ?2-? ligands, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants but combination therapy of alternative agents including opiates is often warranted. Tapentadol extended-release has a novel dual mechanism of action; it is both a mu-opioid receptor agonist and a norephinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It has been in the spotlight since it was FDA-approved specifically for the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in 2012. Previous reviews of tapentadol have focused on chronic pain. The purpose of this review article is to assess the efficacy and safety of tapentadol extended-release in adult populations with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and provide guidance for formulary decisions.
