{"id":90828,"title":"An unusual case of chronic lateral foot pain following ankle inversion injury: osteoid osteoma of the tarsal cuboid bone.","abstract":"Osteoid osteomas are common benign tumors normally seen in the femur, tibia, and spine. They rarely are seen in the foot. We present an unusual case of osteoid osteoma of the cuboid in a 26-year-old man. This was initially thought to be an ankle sprain, as its first presentation was after a sporting injury. It was then treated as an infection before the true diagnosis--that of osteoid osteoma--was obtained.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572213","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.888243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cuboid bone","weight":0.624131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid_bone"},{"name":"Osteoma","weight":0.596395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoma"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Osteoid osteoma","weight":0.429295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoid_osteoma"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.380768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Osteoid","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoid"},{"name":"Sprained ankle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprained_ankle"}]}
