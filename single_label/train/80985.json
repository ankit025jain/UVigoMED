{"id":80985,"title":"[Field evaluation of a novel plant molluscicide \"Luo-wei\" against the snail Oncomelania hupensis III molluscicidal effect by spraying method in hilly regions].","abstract":"To evaluate the molluscicidal effect of a novel plant molluscicide \"Luo-wei\" (Tea-seed distilled saponins, TDS) against Oncomelania httpensis in billy regions.The molluscicidal effect of TDS at a dose of 5 g/m2 by the spraying method against Oncomelania snails was assessed in a setting with a high snail density in Husban Village, Jiangning District of Nanjing City, and the effect was compared with that of 50% wettable powder of niclosamide ethanolamine salt (WPN) at a dose of 2 gIm2 at different time after spraying.Afterl, 3, 7 and 15 day (days) of the spraying experiment, the snail death rates of the TDS group were 56.47%, 57.32%, 90.58% and 93.41% respectively, while those of the WPN group were 49.22%, 53.37%, 95.92% and 97.26%, respectively. The differences between the rates of the 2 groups 1, 7, 15 day (days) after the spraying were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). Fifteen days after the spraying, the density of living snails reduced from 20.30 +/- 16.20 snails/0.1 m2 and 23.67 +/- 21.22 snails/0.1 m2 to 2.28 +/- 2.17 snails/0.1 m2 and 1.27 +/- 0.76 snailsl0.1 m2 in the TDS group and WPN group, respectively, with the reduction rates of 88.77% and 94.63%, respectively.TDS can be used as an alternative molluscicide for the control of Oncornelania snails in hilly areas, which deserves further popularization.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490361","annotations":[{"name":"Death","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.118789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Gunpowder","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder"},{"name":"Molluscicide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molluscicide"},{"name":"Ethanolamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanolamine"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Niclosamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niclosamide"},{"name":"Jiangning District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangning_District"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Match play","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Billycan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billycan"},{"name":"Total dissolved solids","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_dissolved_solids"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Wetting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting"}]}
