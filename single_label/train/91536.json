{"id":91536,"title":"[Important role of orthoses in the management of postburn scar contracture].","abstract":"Joints involved in deep burn often result in joint contracture, limb dysfunction, psychological disorder, or even loss of living and working abilities. The management of post-burn joint contracture will directly orientate the functional recovery of the patients. Comprehensive intervention may prevent the contracture process of the affected joints. Orthoses application is an important measure and should be maintained throughout the whole process of burn care, from positioning the joints at the early stage to maintaining the range of joint motion at the late stage. Orthoses should be used on the premise of protecting the joint functions. In order to maintain the tissue tension while enhancing the joint mobility and muscle strength, the static orthoses and the dynamic orthoses are often alternately used. It is showed in clinical practice that orthoses are designed and applied on the basis that biomechanics will lead to a better outcome.
