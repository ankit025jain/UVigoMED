{"id":8080,"title":"[Effect of deltaran and melatonin on immune system in rats with experimental contact dermatitis].","abstract":"The aim of the work was investigation of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity together with leukocytes functional stability indexes in rats with the experimental contact dermatitis (ECD) in conditions of complex pharmacological correction using deltaran and melatonin. Experimental trials were performed under conditions of chronic experiment on model chrome-induced ECD. Both deltaran and melatonin either alone or in combination were used for complex pharmacological correction of humoral and cell-mediated immunity and also for stability of leukocytes. The data obtained showed the expressed disturbances of humoral and cell-mediated immunity and neutrophils' functional stability damage under conditions of chrome-induced ECD in rats. The revealed alterations in functional activity of the immune system were successfully corrected using the combined administration of deltaran and melatonin. The activity of medical complex had exponential character.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809178","annotations":[{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.643618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.467122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.409433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.164096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.162801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.117676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
