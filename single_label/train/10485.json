{"id":10485,"title":"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 antagonizes bone morphogenetic protein-4 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis.","abstract":"Our previous work showed that the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) was up-regulated in pathological cardiac hypertrophy models and BMP4 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and BMP4 share greater than 80% amino acid homology and there exists an interaction between BMP2 and BMP4, so the aim of the present study was to elucidate the changes of BMP2 in the cardiac hypertrophy models and the effects of BMP2 on BMP4-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. The in vivo cardiac hypertrophy models were induced by pressure-overload and swimming exercise in mice. BMP2 mRNA and protein expressions increased in pressure-overload and swimming-exercise induced cardiac hypertrophy. BMP2 itself did not elicit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, but antagonized BMP4-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. BMP2 stimulated Akt in cardiomyocytes and Akt inhibitor prevented the antagonism of BMP2 on BMP4-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, BMP2 inhibited BMP4-induced JNK activation in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, BMP2 antagonizes BMP4-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effects of BMP2 on BMP4-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis might be through activating Akt and inhibiting JNK activation.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648278","annotations":[{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.954445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.733543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.612818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.481475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.436821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_2"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_4"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
