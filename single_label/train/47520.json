{"id":47520,"title":"Clinical, biochemical, virological and sonographic profile of incidentally detected asymptomatic HBsAg positive subjects, in Bangladesh.","abstract":"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to be the significant cause of Liver related morbidity and mortality, affecting 400 million people worldwide and a major public health problem in Bangladesh where carrier rates of HBV infection varies from 7.5 to 10%. In Bangladesh prevalence of asymptomatic HBV infection and incidentally detected HBsAg positive subjects were not well studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate the disease activity, replicative status of the virus and to find out the stages of chronic liver disease among incidentally detected asymptomatic HBsAg positive Bangladeshi subjects. Two hundred (200) incidentally detected healthy HBsAg positive subject were evaluated clinically, biochemically, serologically and ultrasonographically from January 2004 to June 2008. HBeAg was found positive in 17(8.5%), anti-HBe was positive in 174(87%), raised serum ALT (>45iu/L) in 45(22.5%), prothrombine time (PT) >3 sec of control in 33(16.5%). Ultrasonography showed coarse hepatic echotexture in 13(6.5%). Evidence of active viral replication and signs of chronic liver disease were observed among incidentally detected healthy HBsAg positive subjects. Such individuals should be followed up at regular interval to evaluate the replicative status of the virus and disease activity so that appropriate measures could be initiated in time.
