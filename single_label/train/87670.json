{"id":87670,"title":"Use of the theoretical domains framework to develop an intervention to improve physical therapist management of the risk of falls after discharge.","abstract":"Older adults have an increased risk of falls after discharge from the hospital. Guidelines to manage this risk of falls are well documented but are not commonly implemented. The aim of this case report is to describe the novel approach of using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to develop an intervention to change the clinical behavior of physical therapists.This project had 4 phases: identifying the evidence-practice gap, identifying barriers and enablers that needed to be addressed, identifying behavior change techniques to overcome the barriers, and determining outcome measures for evaluating behavior change.The evidence-practice gap was represented by the outcome that few patients who had undergone surgery for hip fracture were recognized as having a risk of falls or had a documented referral to a community agency for follow-up regarding the prevention of falls. Project aims aligned with best practice guidelines were established; 12 of the 14 TDF domains were considered to be relevant to behaviors in the project, and 6 behavior change strategies were implemented. Primary outcome measures included the proportion of patients who had documentation of the risk of falls and were referred for a comprehensive assessment of the risk of falls after discharge from the hospital.A systematic approach involving the TDF was useful for designing a multifaceted intervention to improve physical therapist management of the risk of falls after discharge of patients from an acute care setting in South Australia, Australia. This framework enabled the identification of targeted intervention strategies that were likely to influence health care professional behavior. Early case note audit results indicated that positive changes were being made to reduce the evidence-practice gap.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035266","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.708526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.573762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.464248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"South Australia","weight":0.433421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.426775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.360332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.213801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Behavioural change theories","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_change_theories"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
