{"id":68916,"title":"Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma: Incidence, morphological features, immunohistochemical profile, and biologic behavior: A single institution study.","abstract":"This study was undertaken to determine the incidence and the clinicopathologic characteristics of those tumors that qualify as clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPRCC) by the current definitions. From January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2013, a total of twenty-eight CCPRCC were identified (28/648, 4.3%). CCPRCC showed variable architectural patterns including cystic, papillary, tubular, and acinar. Irrespective of the architecture, the tumors were composed of cuboidal or columnar cells with clear cytoplasm, small vesicular, round or oval nuclei, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Variably thick bundles of smooth muscle actin-positive soft tissue encircled the whole tumors, forming a continuous pseudocapsule. CCPRCC strongly expressed PAX8, CA-IX, CK7, cytokeratin 34betaE12, and vimentin, and were negative for RCC, P504s/AMACR, and TFE3. On ultrastructural examination, CCPRCC showed short microvilli, cytoplasmic interdigitations, nuclear pseudoinclusions, and stromal myofibroblasts. To the best of our knowledge, this is first comprehensive ultrastructural study of CCPRCC in the literature. The major differential diagnostic considerations are clear cell renal cell carcinoma, multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma with clear cell changes, and Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma. CCPRCC seems to have a favorable prognosis. In the current series, none of the patients had local recurrence or metastatic disease.
