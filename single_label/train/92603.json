{"id":92603,"title":"Comparison of short-term in vivo precision of bone density and microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia between postmenopausal women and young adults.","abstract":"The purpose was to assess whether precision of bone properties derived via the use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) differs between postmenopausal women and young adults. Using HR-pQCT, we scanned the distal radius and tibia at 2 time points in 34 postmenopausal women (74 ± 7 years) and 30 young adults (mean age ± SD: 27 ± 9 years). Standard protocols were used to acquire bone area, density, and microarchitectural properties. We calculated coefficients of variation (CV; percentage CV and percentage CV of the root mean square) and 95% limits of agreement (95% LOA) to assess precision errors. The 95% LOA is the magnitude of individual change needed to be observed to ensure that a real change has occurred. Multiple Mann-Whitney U-tests (with the use of Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) were used to compare percentage CV between the 2 groups. Significance was set to p < 0.004. All standard outcome variables were not significantly different between the groups. The 95% LOA confirmed that the measurement bias between the groups did not differ. These results suggest that short-term precision errors in HR-pQCT-derived bone outcomes are similar between postmenopausal women and young adults.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Musculoskeletal
