{"id":50729,"title":"Accuracy and acceptability of the 6-day Enlite continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor.","abstract":"This study evaluated the performance and acceptability of the Enlite(®) glucose sensor (Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA).Ninety adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes wore two Enlite sensors on the abdomen and/or buttock for 6 days and calibrated them at different frequencies. On Days 1, 3, and 6, accuracy was evaluated by comparison of sensor glucose values with frequently sampled plasma glucose values collected over a 12-h period. Accuracy was assessed at different reference glucose concentrations and during times when absolute glucose concentration rates of change were <1, 1-2, and >2 mg/dL/min. The sensor's ability to detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia was evaluated with simulated alerts. Subject satisfaction was evaluated with a 7-point Likert-type questionnaire, with a score of 7 indicating strong agreement.With abdomen sensors under actual-use calibration (mean, 2.8 ± 0.9 times/day), the overall mean (median) absolute relative difference (ARD) values between sensor and reference values were 13.6% (10.1%); the corresponding buttock sensor ARD values were 15.5% (10.5%). With abdomen sensors under minimal calibration (mean, 1.2 ± 0.9 times/day), the mean (median) ARD values were 14.7% (10.8%). Mean ARD values of abdomen sensors at rates of change of <1, 1-2, and >2 mg/dL/min were 13.6%, 12.9%, and 16.3%, respectively. With abdomen sensors, 79.5% and 94.1% of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, respectively, were correctly detected; 81.9% and 94.9% of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic alerts, respectively, were confirmed. The failure rates for abdomen and buttock sensors were 19.7% and 13.9%, respectively. Mean responses to survey questions for all subjects related to comfort and ease of use were favorable.The Enlite sensor provided accurate data at different glucose concentrations and rates of change. Subjects found the sensor comfortable and easy to use.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758729","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.892566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.711457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Calibration","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.563785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.521716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.141784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"ARD (broadcaster)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARD_(broadcaster)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Medtronic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medtronic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Subject (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)"},{"name":"Comparison of birth control methods","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_birth_control_methods"},{"name":"Relative change and difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Northridge, Los Angeles","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northridge,_Los_Angeles"}]}
