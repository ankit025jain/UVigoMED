{"id":60753,"title":"Clinicopathologic comparison of plasmablastic lymphoma in HIV-positive, immunocompetent, and posttransplant patients: single-center series of 25 cases and meta-analysis of 277 reported cases.","abstract":"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To gain insight in this aggressive lymphoma subtype, the clinicopathologic characteristics of 25 unpublished single-center PBLs (2 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients, 11 in immunocompetent individuals [IC-PBL], 12 in transplant recipients [PT-PBL]) and of 277 reported PBLs were summarized. In the reported series, PBL patients were predominantly male (77%) with a median age at diagnosis of 46 years (range, 1.2 to 87 y). The majority of the biopsies (66%) was EBV positive. Extranodal presentation was most frequent (88%, of which 35% were oral, 18% gastrointestinal, 12% cutaneous). PBL was diagnosed in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients (50%), immunocompetent individuals (35%), and transplant recipients (14%). These subgroups differed in age at diagnosis (median: 41, 64, 47 y, respectively), primary localization (oral, oral, cutaneous, respectively), EBV positivity (75%, 50%, 67%, respectively), CD45 expression (31%, 33%, 70%, respectively), and C-MYC aberrations (78%, 44%, 38%, respectively). Ann Arbor stage I, EBV positivity, CD45 expression, and lack of C-MYC aberrations were associated with better outcome (P<0.05). Our series of IC-PBL and PT-PBL cases revealed differential expression of CD10 (0% vs. 42%, respectively), CD56 (22% vs. 42%, respectively), TP53 (67% vs. 8%, respectively), and BCL2 (88% vs. 25%, respectively). Gene expression analysis of 5 of our PT-PBLs revealed upregulation of DNMT3B, PTP4A3, and CD320 in EBV-positive PT-PBL and suggested a role for cancer/testis antigens. The results of this retrospective study suggest different pathogenic mechanisms of PBL in different immunologic settings and a potentially important impact of EBV and CD45 on prognosis.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832164","annotations":[{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.810287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.800383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.677114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.541871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.444537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.391097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.153863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ann Arbor staging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor_staging"},{"name":"Neprilysin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neprilysin"},{"name":"DNA methyltransferase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tyrosine_phosphatase"}]}
