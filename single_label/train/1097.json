{"id":1097,"title":"Association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C polymorphisms and essential hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Many studies have investigated the role of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C polymorphisms in essential hypertension (EH), but results are inconclusive. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to clarify the effects of MTHFR C677T/A1298C polymorphisms on the risk of EH.Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies published until January 2014. Data were extracted by two independent authors. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between MTHFR C677T/A1298C polymorphisms and the risk of EH using random effect models or fixed effect models. Finally,30 studies with 5207 cases and 5383 controls were included for C677T polymorphism and 6 studies with 1009 cases and 994 controls were included for A1298C polymorphism.Meta-analysis results indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism contributed to an increased risk of EH (for T vs. C: OR=1.30, 95%CI=1.18–1.43; for TT+CT vs. CC: OR=1.34, 95%CI=1.24–1.46; for TT vs. CC: OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.32–1.99; for TT vs. CT+CC: OR=1.41, 95%CI=1.26–1.59). However, no significant association was detected between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and the risk of EH.This meta-analysis supports that MTHFR C677T polymorphism plays a role in developing EH. MTHFR A1298C polymorphism may not be associated with an increased risk of EH. Further large and well-designed studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","date":"2015-01-20","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25458833","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.809117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.283226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"1009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1009"},{"name":"1298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1298"},{"name":"994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/994"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"261","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/261"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Territorial Army (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Ellis Paul Torrance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Paul_Torrance"},{"name":"Fixed effects model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
