{"id":24709,"title":"[Pharmacological and mechanical support of the myocardium in perioperative period in cardio-surgical patients with chronic heart failure].","abstract":"The article deals with a retrospective study devoted to the combined methods of myocardial support in cardiosurgical patients with chronic heart failure (III-IY FC according to NYHA) and low myocardial reserves capacity (LVEF 28.3 +/- 9.4%). This methods include pharmacologic (Levosimendan) and mechanical support (IABP). During the work we have analyzed data of 116 patients and measured pressure in the pulmonary artery (mmHg), end-systolic volume (ESV ml), end-diastolic volume (ED, ml), stroke volume output (SVO, ml), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %). We evaluated the level of valvular insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension (PH) and BNP concentration (pg/ml). The following indications for the usage of pharmacological and/or mechanical myocardial support were identified: I) Preventive usage of pharmacological and/or mechanical myocardial support is recommended for patients with CHF III-IY FC (NYHA) and low left ventricular EF(< or = 35%), significant valvular insufficiency, PH, PICS (postinfarction cardiosclerosis); 2) The certain method of the support can be chosen with the help of Levosimendan infusion testing; 3) In case one of the above mentioned indications (point 1) or in case of mild reaction to levosimendan infusion in patients with the lesions of more than 2 coronary arteries (including the trunk of the left coronary artery) the usage of combined support is recommended; 4) In case of < or = 6 scores according to EUROSCORE scale, lesions of 2 or more coronary arteries, tricuspid insufficiency (TriI), PH, and high pressure in pulmonary artery (higher than the 2nd degree), high end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume of LV the isolated usage of levosimendan is recommended; 5) In case of significant ischemic heart disease, PICS, lesions of more than 2 coronary arteries, (including the trunk of the left coronary artery) but without significant decrease of pressure in the pulmonary artery, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and TriI the isolated usage of IABP is recommended.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306682","annotations":[{"name":"Tricuspid insufficiency","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_insufficiency"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.860462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.84647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Stroke volume","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_volume"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.794623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.785708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Intra-aortic balloon pump","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-aortic_balloon_pump"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.580419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Left coronary artery","weight":0.462785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Brain natriuretic peptide","weight":0.390025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.300781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
