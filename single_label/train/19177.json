{"id":19177,"title":"Comparison of the ventricle muscle proteome between patients with rheumatic heart disease and controls with mitral valve prolapse: HSP 60 may be a specific protein in RHD.","abstract":"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a serious autoimmune heart disease. The present study was aimed at identifying the differentially expressed proteins between patients with RHD and controls with mitral valve prolapse.Nine patients with RHD and nine controls with mitral valve prolapsed were enrolled for this study. Two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were performed.A total of 39 protein spots with differential expressions were identified between the two groups (P < 0.05, Average Ratio > 1.2 or Average Ratio < -1.2) and four upregulated proteins (including heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60), desmin, PDZ and LIM domain protein 1, and proteasome subunit alpha type-1) and three downregulated proteins (including tropomyosin alpha-1 chain, malate dehydrogenase, and chaperone activity of bc1 complex homolog) were determined.These seven proteins, especially HSP 60, may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of RHD and provide evidence to explain the mechanisms of this complex disease in the future.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
