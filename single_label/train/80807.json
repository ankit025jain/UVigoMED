{"id":80807,"title":"Genotype analysis of T. gondii strains associated with human infection in Egypt.","abstract":"The distribution of Toxoplasma gondii genotypes varies from one geographic area to another. The present study aimed to determine T. gondii genotypes associated with human infection in Egypt. Individuals seropositive for anti-toxoplasma IgG and IgM (group I, n = 50) or for specific IgG only (group II, n = 50) were enrolled. Of the participants, 75 % were asymptomatic pregnant women. The others presented with lymphadenitis (n = 21), chorioretinitis (n = 3), and unexplained hepatomegaly (n = 1). Using nested PCR, T. gondii GRA6-coding fragment was amplified from DNA extracted from blood samples of participants. Amplification was successful in 12 samples with nonsignificant difference between both groups but with a significant association with the presence of toxoplasmosis-related manifestations. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of these samples revealed the presence of type I in seven samples and atypical types in five samples. Both typical and atypical strains were detected in individuals of both groups with no bias towards specific clinical presentation.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525758","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.902885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Hepatomegaly","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatomegaly"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.796422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.761716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.727604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Toxoplasma gondii","weight":0.723973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.638415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.620072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chorioretinitis","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorioretinitis"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.397966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"DNA extraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"}]}
