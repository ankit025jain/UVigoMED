{"id":43252,"title":"Longitudinal and circumferential resection margin in adenocarcinoma of distal esophagus and cardia.","abstract":"Multiple factors are implicated in the long-term survival of patients who have undergone esophagectomy, among these the involvement of longitudinal and circumferential resection margins are well known important prognostic factors. A few studies have assessed the impact of the operative approach on the status of the resection margins, and the data are not well reported, often unclear and, more importantly, there is no scientific evidence or published guideline on what the optimal proximal, distal or circumferential resection margin clearance should be. Owing to the lack of clarity on these points, we undertook a systematic literature review of the impact of longitudinal and circumferential resection margins in patients with operable esophageal cancer, the prognostic significance of margin involvement and the role of neoadjuvant therapy.
