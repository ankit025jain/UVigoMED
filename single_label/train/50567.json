{"id":50567,"title":"Cluster randomised controlled trial: educational self-care intervention with older Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus--impact on blood glucose levels and diabetic complications.","abstract":"To investigate whether self care behaviours, medical outcomes and quality of life of Taiwanese elderly with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) can be improved by delivery of an educational health care package.DM is a major health problem in developed and developing countries, with older adults constituting about half of the diabetic population. Type 2 DM is the most rapidly increasing chronic disease in Taiwan.During 2005 and 2006, Taiwanese elderly with Type 2 DM (n = 500) were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group. Data collection using validated instruments occurred at baseline and 6 months follow-up. Main outcome measures were blood glucose levels and diabetic complications.At baseline, 88.4% participants in the control and 78.8% in the experimental group had a blood glucose level above normal range (p = 0.076); respective results at 6 months were 92.4% for the control group and 60.4% for the experimental group (p < 0.001). The multivariate adjusted result showed that the intervention group was 11.1 times less likely to have blood glucose levels above normal (p = 0.002) at 6 months follow-up compared to the control group. Occurrence of complications was significantly fewer in the intervention group at baseline and at 6 month follow-up compared to the control group (baseline: 42.0% versus 82.1%, p = 0.003; 6 month follow-up: 48.4% versus 87.0%; p = 0.006).Although overall occurrence of complications remained unchanged, the educational health care package specifically developed for Taiwanese elderly with Type 2 DM improved blood glucose levels.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772989","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.606572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.521883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Self care","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_care"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.431998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.331422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
