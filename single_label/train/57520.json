{"id":57520,"title":"Malondialdehyde and antioxidant enzymes in second and third trimesters of pre-eclamptic Nigerian women.","abstract":"To determine changes in malondialdehyde (product of lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione Per-oxidase) levels in pre-eclamptic Nigerian womenA Total of 100 subjects each for pre-eclamptic,apparently normal and non pregnant women were recruited into the study.Venous blood samples were taken from the participants during second and third trimesters of pregnancy and at the point of contact for non pregnant women. Malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were measured accordingly from plasma and haemolysate prepared from whole blood.Variables were analysed using SPSS version 16, taking level of significance to be 0.05 RESULTS: Plasma malondialdehyde in the third trimester (3.13±0.61umol/l) of pre-eclamptic subjects was higher than in the second trimester (3.00±1.21umol/l).Plasma malondialdehyde in the third trimester of normal pregnancy (2.03±0.71umol/l) was also found to be significantly higher than in the second trimester (1.65±0.62umol/ l)(p<0.0001). Glutathione peroxidase in pre-eclamptic subjects was significantly higher in the third trimester (2804.11±1573.00U/L) as compared to the second trimester (2655.00±1751.30U/L), p= 0.0001.Glutathione peroxidase activity in the third trimester of normal pregnancy(3339.50±1733.80U/L) was also found to be higher than in the second trimester(3023.50±1115.90U/L)(p=0.131). Superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in the third trimester of pre-eclamptic pregnancy when compared to second trimester (110.40±59.47 Vs 118.01±64.41 U/ ml)(p<0.039) .Similarly,superoxide dismutase activity was significantly lower in the third trimester of normal pregnancy (110.40±59.47U/ml) than in the second trimester(153.01±71.85U/ml)(p<0.0001).There was an increased level of lipid peroxidation products,malondialdehyde in subjects with pre-eclampsia. This was more in the third trimester. There was an increased oxidative stress in pre-eclampsia as evidenced also by low serum level of superoxide dismutase in the third trimester.Diet rich in antioxidant enzyme might be beneficial.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25126869","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.870545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.797079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0788712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
