{"id":5487,"title":"[Study on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics correlation of yin teng gu bi kang prescription].","abstract":"To study pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) correlation of Yin Teng Gu Bi Kang (YTGBK) prescription through determination of Tanshinone II(A) concentration and the level of Malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma in normal and blood stasis rats treated with YTGBK prescription.The concentration of Tanshinone II(A) in the plasma was measured by HPLC-UV and loratadine was used as internal standard; Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS) was adopted to determine the concentration of MDA in the plasma Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and area under the effect-time curve (AUE) were calculated using linear trapezoid rule. The correlation and regression analysis was performed by plotting AUE (Y) versus lgAUC (X) using linear regression.YTGBK prescription could significantly decrease MDA level in the plasma in above two different physiological rats at the analyzed time point (P < 0.05). Scatter plots of AUE-lgAUC showed an upward trend. The results of the correlation and regression analysis were as follows: Y = 53.367 X -30.780, r = 0. 822, P = 0.007 for normal rats and Y = 61.091 X -39.863, r = 0.777, P = 0.003 for model rats, respectively.There is a positive correlation between Tanshinone II(A) level in plasma and the antioxidant activity of YTGBK prescription in decreasing MDA level, which indicates that Tanshinone II(A) is the antioxidant effective substance of YTGBK prescription.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174116","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.50247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Scatter plot","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0977736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Trapezoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid"},{"name":"Loratadine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loratadine"},{"name":"Trapezoidal rule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule"},{"name":"3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Internal standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_standard"},{"name":"Blood stasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_stasis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"822","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/822"},{"name":"863","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/863"},{"name":"Plot (narrative)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Administrative divisions of South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_South_Korea"},{"name":"Kang bed-stove","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_bed-stove"},{"name":"H.
