{"id":86859,"title":"Continued seasonal circulation of enterovirus D68 in the Netherlands, 2011-2014.","abstract":"Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) continued to circulate in a seasonal pattern in the Netherlands, after the outbreak in 2010. Outpatient EV-D68 cases, mainly in the under 20 and 50â€“59 years age groups, presented with relatively mild respiratory disease. Hospital-based enterovirus surveillance identified more severe cases, mainly in children under 10 years of age. Dutch partial VP1 genomic region sequences from 2012 through 2014 were distributed over three sublineages similar to EV-D68 from the outbreak in the US in 2014.","date":"2014-10-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358039","annotations":[{"name":"Genome","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.463455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.302713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.247693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.127975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vice president","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Enterovirus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterovirus"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"New Zealand national under-20 football team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_under-20_football_team"},{"name":"Enhanced Versatile Disc","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Versatile_Disc"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
