{"id":36218,"title":"Prevalence of congenital coronary artery anomalies and variants in 726 consecutive patients based on 64-slice coronary computed tomography angiography.","abstract":"Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is helpful in making a precise noninvasive evaluation of coronary anatomy, allowing concomitant evaluation of other cardiac structures. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of coronary artery variations detected by 64-slice multi detector CT.The results of ECG-gated CCTA in 726 consecutive patients (mean age 58 years) were analysed retrospectively. The main indications for CCTA were a typical chest pain, angina pectoris, screening for coronary artery disease and determination of the patency of bypass grafts or stents. Acquisition was performed with a 64-detector CT scanner with retrospective ECG gating. Imaging results were assessed by experienced cardiovascular radiologist.The overall incidence of coronary artery anomalies was 1.1% (8 out of 726 participants). The most common anomaly was an anomalous origin of the circumflex artery from the right coronary sinus with a retroaortic course (4 patients,0.6%), followed by origin of right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus (2 patients, 0.3%). One patient with abnormal origin of the left main artery from the right coronary sinus (0.1%) and 1 patient with a circumflex artery origin from the proximal segment of the right coronary artery (0.1%) were observed, both with retroartic course.CCTA is a noninvasive imaging technique useful for the precise evaluation of variations of the coronary arteries. This study shows similar results to other reports on this subject.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590523","annotations":[{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.686122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.564701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.52225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Circumflex branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.417482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Right coronary artery","weight":0.414478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.315169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Coronary sinus","weight":0.271105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_sinus"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.204814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0741325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"}]}
