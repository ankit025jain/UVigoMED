{"id":87871,"title":"Influence of self-efficacy and coping on quality of life and social participation after acquired brain injury: a 1-year follow-up study.","abstract":"To investigate the relations linking self-efficacy and coping to quality of life (QOL) and social participation and what effect self-efficacy, changes in self-efficacy, and coping style have on long-term QOL and social participation.Prospective clinical cohort study.General hospitals, rehabilitation centers.Patients with newly acquired brain injury (ABI) (N=148) were assessed at baseline (start outpatient rehabilitation or discharge hospital/inpatient rehabilitation; mean time since injury, 15wk) and 1 year later (mean time since injury, 67wk).Not applicable.QOL was measured with the EuroQuol 5D (the EQ-5D index and the EQ-5D visual analog scale [EQ VAS]) and the 9-item Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-9), social participation with the modified Frenchay Activities Index, coping with the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, and self-efficacy with the Traumatic Brain Injury Self-efficacy Questionnaire.At baseline, self-efficacy moderated the effect of emotion-oriented coping on the EQ-5D index and of avoidance coping on the EQ VAS. Self-efficacy mediated the relation between emotion-oriented coping and LiSat-9. An increase in self-efficacy over time predicted better scores on the EQ-5D index (?=.30), the EQ VAS (?=.49), and LiSat-9 (?=.44) at follow-up. In addition, higher initial self-efficacy (?=.40) predicted higher LiSat-9 scores at follow-up; higher initial emotion-oriented coping (?=-.23) predicted lower EQ VAS scores at follow-up. Higher modified Frenchay Activities Index scores at follow-up were predicted by higher self-efficacy (?=.19) and higher task-oriented coping (?=.14) at baseline (combined R(2)=5.1%).Self-efficacy and coping predict long-term QOL but seem less important in long-term social participation. High self-efficacy protects against the negative effect of emotion-oriented coping. Enhancing self-efficacy in the early stage after ABI may have beneficial long-term effects.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973499","annotations":[{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.876545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.757598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.663995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.648787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.521298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Frenchay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchay"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Neutron moderator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Equalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization"},{"name":"Renault 25","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_25"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Application binary interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Rehabilitation (penology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
