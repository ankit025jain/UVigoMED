{"id":57490,"title":"Frozen section of uterine curetting in excluding the possibility of ectopic pregnancy--a clinicopathologic study of 715 cases.","abstract":"To investigate the utility of frozen section of uterine curetting in excluding the possibility of ectopic pregnancy (EP).A retrospective analysis of 715 curetting records in the present hospital from July 1999 to May 2009 was obtained. All specimens were processed routinely with frozen section and paraffin section.Of 715 cases, frozen section analyses were discordant in 33 cases (4.6%), including 32 cases under-diagnosed, and one case over-diagnosed, compared with the final diagnoses. Frozen section had a sensitivity of 92.6%, specificity of 99.6%, and frozen section accuracy rate of 95.4%.Frozen section is a useful and rapid method to differentiate EP from intrauterine pregnancy.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134289","annotations":[{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.445673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.234999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0670588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Extended play","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cryogenics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Discordant","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordant"},{"name":"Overdiagnosis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdiagnosis"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
