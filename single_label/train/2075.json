{"id":2075,"title":"Biliary stenting as alternative therapy to stone clearance in elderly patients with bile duct stones. .","abstract":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangio- pancreatography with stone retrieval following endoscopic sphinc- terotomy (ES) is the standard method for the management of cho- ledocholithiasis. However, biliary stenting is used to treat patients with endoscopically irretrievable bile duct stones, especially elderly and high-risk patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits and risks of biliary stenting versus stone clearance follow- ing ES in the management of choledocholithiasis.Between January 2010 and December 2012, 165 patients with common bile duct stones who underwent biliary stenting or stone clearance following ES were enrolled. One 7 Fr. double-pigtail plastic stent was placed without ES or stone extraction. The procedure time, hospitalization period, adverse events, additional endoscopic interventions required and one-year mortality were evaluated retrospectively.Ninety-nine and 66 patients were included in stenting group and in stone clearance group, respectively. Except for age, number of stones, and use of antithrombotic agents in the stent group, there were no statistically significant difference between groups. The average procedure time and hospitalization period in the stenting group were significantly shorter than those in stone clearance group (mean 21 min vs. 43.9 min, P < 0.0001; 3.8 days vs. 6.5 days, P < 0.0001). No significant differences were seen in ad- verse events and additional endoscopic interventions required be- tween both groups for at least a 1.5-year follow-up. No one-year mortality occurred.Biliary stenting using a double-pigtail stent proved to be a useful alternative therapy to stone clearance following ES in the management of choledocholithiasis in elderly patients.","date":"2014-12-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509199","annotations":[{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.780751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.66495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.485979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.4316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.270433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Ninetynine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninetynine"},{"name":"Choledocholithiasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choledocholithiasis"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Poetry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Tween (demographic)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tween_(demographic)"}]}
