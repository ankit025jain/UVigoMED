{"id":10649,"title":"Endothelial cell-specific liver kinase B1 deletion causes endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in mice in vivo.","abstract":"Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a tumor suppressor, is a central regulator of cell polarity and energy homeostasis. The role of LKB1 in endothelial function in vivo has not been explored.Endothelium-specific LKB1 knockout (LKB1(endo-/-)) mice were generated by cross-breeding LKB1(flox/flox) mice with VE-Cadherin-Cre mice. LKB1(endo-/-) mice exhibited hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. LKB1(endo-/-) endothelial cells exhibited reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and AMP kinase (a downstream enzyme of LKB1) phosphorylation at Thr172 compared with wild-type (WT) cells. In addition, the levels of caveolin-1 were higher in the endothelial cells of LKB1(endo-/-) mice, and knockdown of caveolin-1 by siRNA normalized endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. Human antigen R bound with the adenylate-uridylate-rich elements of caveolin-1 mRNA 3' untranslated region, resulting in the increased stability of caveolin-1, and genetic knockdown of human antigen R decreased the expression of caveolin-1 in LKB1-deficient endothelial cells. Finally, adenoviral overexpression of constitutively active AMP kinase, but not green fluorescent protein, decreased caveolin-1, lowered blood pressure, and improved endothelial function in LKB1(endo-/-) mice in vivo.Our findings indicate that endothelial LKB1 regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, endothelial function, and blood pressure by modulating AMP kinase-mediated caveolin-1 expression.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637557","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering
