{"id":14920,"title":"Animal models for the effective development of atrophic vaginitis therapies: possibilities and limitations.","abstract":"Vaginal atrophy (VA) is an inflammation of the vagina that develops when there is a significant decrease in levels of the estrogen. Prolonged periods of hypoestrogenism may induce severe VA and treatment is essential. This is a significant problem which requires more focused attention for the development of existing and future therapies.This review evaluates the suitable animal models of VA, including: mice, rodents and non-human primates. It focuses particularly on the possibilities and limitations of these in vivo models for the effective development of VA therapies.Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been prescribed and successfully used for VA. However, some studies have shown that HRT may be linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, coronary heart diseases and others risks. Thus, there is a growing interest in effective and safe alternatives to VA symptoms. There are, however, a number of things that must be considered for future drug discovery efforts. One major consideration is what animal model should be used and whether the model is appropriate for the study aim. Similarly, research studies must also consider the influencing factors on these animal models, so that these models can effectively mimic the actual disease. The authors also highlight the need to standardize research parameters to produce more reliable and reproducible data.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397873","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.735773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.722612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)","weight":0.588597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.227191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.0734405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.0333333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Vaginitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginitis"},{"name":"Atrophic vaginitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophic_vaginitis"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
