{"id":56442,"title":"[New method for treatment of chronic blepharitis associated with dry eye syndrome].","abstract":"A new combined method for treatment of chronic blepharitis associated with dry eye syndrome is developed. A total of 25 patients were enrolled. The treatment implied the use of artificial tears, Restasis, and Blephasteam spectacle frame. The course included 20 procedures on daily basis. The monitoring period was 1 year. A pronounced anti-inflammatory, reparative, and moistening effect as well as stabilization of the precorneal film was achieved in short time. Owing to the combined approach, negative side effects (such as burning, conjunctival irritation, and fluctuating vision) were minimized. Repeated treatment courses maintained the positive therapeutic effect and prolongated the remission.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684070","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.630688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Blepharitis","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blepharitis"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Artificial tears","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_tears"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
