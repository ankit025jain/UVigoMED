{"id":25485,"title":"Aortic valve replacement through right anterior minithoracotomy: can sutureless technology improve clinical outcomes?","abstract":"The impact of sutureless prosthesis on the clinical outcome in minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is still unclear. We assessed mid-term outcomes of the sutureless and conventional valves implanted through right anterior minithoracotomy.Five hundred fifteen patients undergoing primary aortic valve replacement through a right anterior minithoracotomy (269 conventional versus 246 sutureless prostheses) between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed. The most common sutured prostheses were Carpentier-Edwards Perimount and Medtronic Mosaic, and the Sorin Perceval S mainly composed the sutureless prosthesis group. One hundred thirty-three pairs of patients were propensity matched and retrospectively analyzed.Cardiopulmonary bypass (p<0.0001) and cross-clamping (p<0.0001) times were shorter in the sutureless group (S group). We observed the same in-hospital mortality (1 versus 2; p=0.62) and incidence of postoperative stroke and pacemaker implant between the groups, but shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (6 versus 7 hours; p=0.001) in the S group. Generally, larger prostheses were implanted in the S group (p<0.0001). Follow-up was longer (p<0.0001) for sutured valves: 52 versus 15 months (overall median, 21 months). Overall Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 87.2% versus 97.0% (p=0.33) and 50% versus 100% (p=0.02) in elderly patients for sutured versus sutureless prostheses, respectively. Freedom from reoperation at follow-up (p=0.64) and transaortic gradients (12 versus 11 mm Hg; p=0.78) did not differ in the two groups.In the present limited cohort of patients, sutureless prostheses reduced operative times for aortic valve replacement and the duration of mechanically assisted ventilation and might have influenced early and mid-term survival. Larger studies are needed to confirm our data and compare long-term outcomes.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular
