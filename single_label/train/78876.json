{"id":78876,"title":"Presence of symptom clusters in surgically treated patients with esophageal cancer: implications for survival.","abstract":"It is not known whether symptoms cluster together after esophageal cancer surgery or whether such symptom clusters are associated with survival in patients with esophageal cancer who are treated surgically.Data from a prospective Swedish nationwide cohort study of surgically treated patients with esophageal cancer recruited between 2001 and 2005 were used. General and esophageal cancer-specific symptoms were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 quality of life questionnaire and the QLQ-OES18 module at 6 months after surgery. Associations between symptom clusters and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, providing hazards ratios with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for other known prognostic factors.Among 402 patients reporting symptoms 6 months after surgery, 3 symptom clusters were identified. The first symptom cluster (“fatigue/pain”) was characterized by symptoms of pain, fatigue, insomnia, and dyspnea and was present in 30% of patients. The second symptom cluster (“reflux/cough”) was characterized by symptoms of dry mouth, problems with taste, coughing, and reflux and was present in 27% of patients. The third symptom cluster (“eating difficulties”) was characterized by appetite loss, dysphagia, eating difficulties, and nausea/vomiting and was present in 28% of patients. The presence of the reflux/cough and eating difficulties symptom clusters was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.43 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.89] and adjusted HR, 1.41 [95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.87], respectively).Symptoms experienced by surgically treated patients with esophageal cancer appear to cluster together, and the presence of these symptom clusters appears to have strong prognostic value.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555183","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.800237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.770772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.596676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.524517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.510535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.43407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.291125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
