{"id":50637,"title":"ABCC8 genetic variants and risk of diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem worldwide and it will rapidly increase. This disease is characterized by hyperglycemia caused by defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. DM has three types: T1DM, T2M and gestational DM (GDM), of them T2DM is more frequent. Multiple genes and their interactions are involved in insulin secretion pathway. Sulfonylurea receptor encoded by ABCC8 gene, together with inward-rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir6.2) regulates insulin secretion by ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel located in the plasma membranes. Disruption of these molecules by different mutations is responsible for risk of DM. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCC8 gene and their interaction are involved in pathogenicity of DM. This review summarizes the current evidence of contribution of ABC8 genetic variants to the development of DM.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768178","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.824742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Potassium channel","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Sulfonylurea","weight":0.704782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.703039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.643986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.185579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Kir6.2","weight":0.0772076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir6.2"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"Sulfonylurea receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea_receptor"},{"name":"ABCC8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC8"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"}]}
