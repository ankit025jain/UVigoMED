{"id":30000,"title":"Castor bean seed ingestions: a state-wide poison control system's experience.","abstract":"Ingestions of the seed of the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis) carries the risk of toxicity from ricin, a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis.We sought to describe characteristics of castor bean seed exposures reported to a state-wide poison control system.This was an observational case series. A state-wide poison control system's database was reviewed for exposures to castor bean plant seeds from 2001 to 2011. Case notes were reviewed and data collected, when available, included age, gender, circumstances surrounding exposure, number of castor beans consumed, whether beans were chewed or crushed, symptoms described, laboratory values (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], prothrombin time [PT] and international normalized ratio [INR]), duration of follow-up, treatment, and patient outcomes.Eighty-four cases were identified. Ingestions were unintentional in 50 cases (59%) cases and intentional in 34 (40%) cases. A median of 10 seeds (range: 1-20) were ingested in intentional cases versus 1 seed (range: 1-40) in unintentional cases. In 49 (58%) of cases the seeds were reported to have been chewed or crushed. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly reported symptoms. Vomiting (n = 39), nausea (n = 24), diarrhea (n = 17), and abdominal pain (n = 16) predominated. One patient developed hematochezia and vomiting after reportedly ingesting and intravenously injecting castor bean seeds. Laboratory values were documented in 17 (20%) cases. Only one abnormality was noted; an asymptomatic patient one week following ingestion had AST/ALT of 93 U/L and 164 U/L, respectively. Ricinine was confirmed in the urine of two patients. Twenty-three (27%) cases received activated charcoal. Seventy-two (86%) of cases were calls from health care facilities or referred to health care facilities by the poison control center. Twenty-two (26%) cases were admitted for a median of 2 days (range: 1-10). Admitted cases ingested a median of 8.5 seeds (range: 1-20). Intentional ingestions were followed for median of 37.5 h (range: 0.5-285.5) while unintentional cases were followed for 14 h (range: 1-182). No delayed symptoms, serious outcomes, or deaths were reported.Due to the presence of ricin, there is concern for serious outcomes after ingestions of the seeds of the castor bean plant. In this study GI symptoms were most commonly reported but serious morbidity or mortality was not present. The true risk of castor bean plant seed ingestions should continue to be re-evaluated.In this retrospective review, gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common symptoms described after reported exposures to castor bean seeds. These exposures were not associated with serious morbidity, mortality, or delayed symptoms.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced
