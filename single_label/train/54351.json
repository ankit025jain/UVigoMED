{"id":54351,"title":"Insulin-derived amyloidosis and poor glycemic control: a case series.","abstract":"Insulin-derived amyloidosis is a rare skin-related complication of insulin therapy. The purpose of this study was to show the effects of insulin-derived amyloidosis on blood glucose levels, insulin dose requirements, and insulin absorption.Seven patients were found to have insulin-derived amyloidosis at the Tokyo Medical University Ibaraki Medical Center. The clinical characteristics and insulin therapy of the 7 patients were investigated. Insulin absorption was studied by comparing the serum insulin levels after insulin injections into insulin-derived amyloidosis sites versus injections into normal sites in 4 patients.When the insulin-derived amyloidosis was discovered, the mean hemoglobin A1c level was 9.3%, and the mean daily insulin dose was 57 units. After changing the injection sites to avoid the insulin-derived amyloidosis, the blood glucose concentrations improved, and the mean daily insulin dose could be reduced to 27 units (P = .035; 53% reduction). The insulin absorption at insulin-derived amyloidosis sites was 34% of that at normal sites (P = .030).Insulin-derived amyloidosis caused poor glycemic control and increased insulin dose requirements because of impairments in insulin absorption.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462809","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.795801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.525487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.522356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Tokyo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Tokyo Medical University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Medical_University"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.0151958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Ibaraki Prefecture","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibaraki_Prefecture"}]}
