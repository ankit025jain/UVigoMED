{"id":62747,"title":"Combination immunotherapy after ASCT for multiple myeloma using MAGE-A3/Poly-ICLC immunizations followed by adoptive transfer of vaccine-primed and costimulated autologous T cells.","abstract":"Myeloma-directed cellular immune responses after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may reduce relapse rates. We studied whether coinjecting the TLR-3 agonist and vaccine adjuvant Poly-ICLC with a MAGE-A3 peptide vaccine was safe and would elicit a high frequency of vaccine-directed immune responses when combined with vaccine-primed and costimulated autologous T cells.T-cell infusions were well tolerated, whereas vaccine injection site reactions occurred in >90% of patients. Two of nine patients who received montanide developed sterile abscesses; however, this did not occur in the 18 patients who did not receive montanide. Dextramer staining demonstrated MAGE-A3-specific CD8 T cells in 7 of 8 evaluable HLA-A2(+) patients (88%), whereas vaccine-specific cytokine-producing T cells were generated in 19 of 25 patients (76%). Antibody responses developed in 7 of 9 patients (78%) who received montanide and only weakly in 2 of 18 patients (11%) who did not. The 2-year overall survival was 74% [95% confidence interval (CI), 54%-100%] and 2-year event-free survival was 56% (95% CI, 37%-85%).A high frequency of vaccine-specific T-cell responses were generated after transplant by combining costimulated autologous T cells with a Poly-ICLC/GM-CSF-primed MAGE-A3 vaccine.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520093","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunologic adjuvant","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.738291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.610331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.447016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.362478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.313163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.273912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"TLR 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_3"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"}]}
