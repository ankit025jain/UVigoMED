{"id":82806,"title":"[Effect of coenzyme Q10 on the expression of tumor necrosis factor-? and interleukin-10 in gingival tissue of experimental periodontitis in rats].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of coenzyme Q10 on the levels of tumor necrosis factor-?(TNF-?) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in gingival tissue of experimental periodontitis in rats.A total of 48 healthy Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups of 16 randomly, normal group, coenzyme Q10 treatment group (Q10 group) and periodontitis group.Normal group was fed with normal diet and water. Periodontitis models were established in other two groups.Q10 group received coenzyme Q10 for 12 weeks and periodontitis group was fed with the same dose of normal saline.Four rats in each group were sacrified before administration and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after administration. Gingival tissue samples from mandiblar first permanent molar were taken. The levels of TNF-? and IL-10 were detected by immunohistochemistry.The expression of TNF-? in periodontitis group [54.9% (52.9%, 57.3%)] was significantly higher than that in Q10 group [15.1% (12.7%, 17.5%)] at 12 weeks (P < 0.0167) . The expression of IL-10 in periodontitis group [8.9% (7.9%, 10.0%)]was significantly lower than that in the Q10 group [38.9% (38.0%, 40.4%)] (P < 0.0167) . The expression of TNF-? in periodontitis group was significantly higher than that in Q10 group at 12th weeks (P < 0.0167) . The expression of IL-10 in periodontitis group was significantly lower than that in the Q10 group (P < 0.0167).Coenzyme Q10 inhibits the expression of TNF-? and promotes the expression of IL-10 in periodontal tissues of experimental periodontitis rats. Coenzyme Q10 may play a role in treating periodontitis.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513070","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Coenzyme Q10","weight":0.900892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.575565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.529984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.322268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.191842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.0787183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"}]}
