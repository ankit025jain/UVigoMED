{"id":61030,"title":"Ferroportin mediates the intestinal absorption of iron from a nanoparticulate ferritin core mimetic in mice.","abstract":"The ferritin core is composed of fine nanoparticulate Fe(3+) oxohydroxide, and we have developed a synthetic mimetic, nanoparticulate Fe(3+) polyoxohydroxide (nanoFe(3+)). The aim of this study was to determine how dietary iron derived in this fashion is absorbed in the duodenum. Following a 4 wk run-in on an Fe-deficient diet, mice with intestinal-specific disruption of the Fpn-1 gene (Fpn-KO), or littermate wild-type (WT) controls, were supplemented with Fe(2+) sulfate (FeSO4), nanoFe(3+), or no added Fe for a further 4 wk. A control group was Fe sufficient throughout. Direct intestinal absorption of nanoFe(3+) was investigated using isolated duodenal loops. Our data show that FeSO4 and nanoFe(3+) are equally bioavailable in WT mice, and at wk 8 the mean ± SEM hemoglobin increase was 18 ± 7 g/L in the FeSO4 group and 30 ± 5 g/L in the nanoFe(3+) group. Oral iron failed to be utilized by Fpn-KO mice and was retained in enterocytes, irrespective of the iron source. In summary, although nanoFe(3+) is taken up directly by the duodenum its homeostasis is under the normal regulatory control of dietary iron absorption, namely via ferroportin-dependent efflux from enterocytes, and thus offers potential as a novel oral iron supplement.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776745","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Ferroportin","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroportin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.743686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Enterocyte","weight":0.597723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocyte"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.5807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.56611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.25922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Iron supplements","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplements"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.116551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Litter (animal)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(animal)"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Planetary core","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_core"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
