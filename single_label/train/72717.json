{"id":72717,"title":"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by L-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy, VIDL, for localized nasal extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma: CISL08-01 phase II study.","abstract":"We conducted a phase II trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by 2 cycles of L-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy for patients who were newly diagnosed with stages IE and IIE nasal extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). CCRT consisted of 40-44 Gy of radiotherapy with weekly administration of 30 mg/m(2) of cisplatin for 4 weeks. Two cycles of VIDL (etoposide (100 mg/m(2)), ifosfamide (1,200 mg/m(2)), and dexamethasone (40 mg) from days 1 to 3, and L-asparaginase (4,000 IU/m(2)) every other day from days 8 to 20) were administered sequentially. CCRT yielded a 90 % overall response rate without significant side effects in 30 patients, including 20 patients with complete response (CR); however, two patients showed distant disease progression. After CCRT, VIDL chemotherapy showed an 87 % final CR rate (26/30). Although grade III or IV hematologic toxicity was frequent during VIDL chemotherapy, no treatment-related mortality was observed, and L-asparaginase-associated toxicity was manageable. With a median follow-up of 44 months, 11 patients showed local (n?=?4) and distant (n?=?7) relapse or progression. The estimated 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 73 and 60 %, respectively. In conclusion, CCRT followed by L-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy is a feasible treatment for newly diagnosed stages IE/IIE nasal ENKTL.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947798","annotations":[{"name":"Ifosfamide","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifosfamide"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.767749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.482422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.467719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Natural Killer T cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Killer_T_cell"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Republic of Ireland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"},{"name":"27th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_century_BC"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Centre for Cultural Resources and Training","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Cultural_Resources_and_Training"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"}]}
